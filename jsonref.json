The Max has been grounded since March.Officials with Indonesia\u0027s Garuda said in March that they were canceling the remaining 49 of a 50-jet Max order. Published reports suggest the airline and Boeing are in talks, however, and Boeing still lists the last 49 Garuda orders on its website.Similarly, the owner of Lion Air - the Indonesia airline whose Max jet was involved in the first fatal crash in October - vowed to cancel. Boeing still lists the airline\u0027s 187 unfilled orders as active.Middle Eastern carriers Flydubai and Oman Air have threatened to switch to Airbus.Flyadeal did not mention Boeing in its weekend announcement and did not disclose financial terms of the Airbus order, although the list price of the planes is about $5.5 billion. Carriers rarely pay list prices.         Saudi employees of the Flydeal airlines company take a selfie during the 2017 launching ceremony held at the King Abdulaziz airport in the coastal city of JeddahFlyadeal said the Airbus agreement emerged from last month\u0027s Paris Air Show.A Boeing spokesman said Monday that the company does not discuss customer decisions.Boeing got a boost at the Paris Air Show when the parent company of British Airways and Spain\u0027s Iberia said it intends to buy another 200 Max planes. The CEO of International Airlines Group, Willie Walsh, said he was confident the plane would make a successful return.Boeing disclosed in April that it has booked about $1 billion in charges related to fixing the plane. Analysts expect that to rise sharply.Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by families of those aboard the downed planes. Boeing will likely have to compensate airlines that already own Max planes - nearly 400 around the world - which are not expected to be allowed in back into the air any time soon.The company suspended deliveries of new planes in March but has kept the assembly line open at a reduced production rate.Though other planes have overcome passenger fears about safety, it is uncertain how passengers will feel about getting back on board a Max. Various surveys have indicated passenger reluctance.Preliminary investigations in Indonesia and Ethiopia point to new software that pushed down the nose of planes in response to faulty readings by a single sensor on each plane. Boeing is making the software less powerful and connecting it to a second sensor, but engineers have encountered setbacks.Pilots with the Federal Aviation Administration discovered a new flaw last month while testing updated software in a flight simulator, pushed back Boeing\u0027s timetable. It now hopes to submit a final application to the FAA in September.Boeing marketed the Max as an aircraft with more seats and lower operating costs than the Airbus neo. Boeing still has more than 4,500 unfilled orders for the Max. Customers, including three of the four largest U.S. airlines, have given no hint that they plan to nix orders from Boeing.

On Tuesday, its success was announced.Although the painting is a scene of the Thames in Surrey, Norfolk was keen to get the painting because there are no Turners in east of England collections.It fills a gap and will complement holdings of important landscapes by painters such as John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough and Norwich School artists including John Sell Cotman and John Crome, for whom Turner was an important influence.Margaret Dewsbury, a Norfolk county councillor and cabinet member for communities and partnerships, said: “This news is cause for celebration for everyone who cares about the cultural heritage of the nation. For the east of England, the acquisition of Walton Bridges will make a significant contribution to the region’s cultural economy, bringing in many more visitors and raising its profile nationally.”She said she hoped the presence of a “Turner for the east” would encourage complementary loans, “enriching the cultural life of East Anglia for decades to come”.The Turner painting, which dates from 1806, is particularly significant because it is thought to be the first oil painting the artist completed in the open air, a practice that became an important element of his work.The arts minister Rebecca Pow said she was delighted the piece had been saved for the nation. “Turner’s magnificent work, painted at the beginning of the industrial revolution, will now continue to be exhibited and admired and will inspire future generations of British artists thanks to Norfolk Museums Service,” she said.The painting will go on display at Norwich Castle from September and will embark on a three-year tour around the region, including King’s Lynn, Ipswich, Colchester and Great Yarmouth, before returning for permanent display in Norwich.The money for the acquisition came from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the Art Fund and private donors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7decdf4dc58d59acb801c6d8dc83522a77bb8b73/0_556_5262_3158/master/5262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fd66dd32412119c568c6148759d6758","title":"the book you wish your parents had read philippa perry review","story":"What should be the top priority for a parent? A bestseller considers screens, sleep and why children should be listened to, though not always agreed withIt is one of the cliches of parenthood that the behaviour which comes most easily (a reproving tone of voice, say, or an attitude to your child’s tears) reflects what your parents did with you. It takes a while to realise that what feels like instinct is often an inheritance, that just because something comes “naturally” it is not necessarily constructive. It may get in the way, first, of the relationship between parent and child, and then, because this relationship provides the foundation for all future relationships, of how the child will get on in the world.Enter Philippa Perry’s book, which has an inspired title (even if one commenter on Mumsnet argued it veers a little close to clickbait). Perry has a plan “for parents who not only love their children but want to like them too”. Except it isn’t really a plan, as such: more of an attitude, a way of being, a set of assumptions. Children are not problems to be fixed or projects at which to excel, but iniduals to be understood and supported, in a mutually respectful relationship. Their feelings, however inconvenient, must be heard and validated (which is very different from being agreed with), because if they aren’t they will find other, even less desirable ways of expressing themselves, if not at the time then later in life. Perry understands how necessary it is to examine our reactions to these small iniduals, and to determine whether what we are reacting to, when we become angry or distressed, is their behaviour, or something childlike in ourselves.Perry is a psychotherapist and agony aunt who has spent 20 years, as she puts it, “mirroring and validating” to get people “back on track. If parents could do this from the off, surely I could give up being a psychotherapist – and arrange flowers instead.” She is also the parent of a daughter, Flo (who, she reveals in one of the rare personal passages, was born with the umbilical cord wrapped three times around her neck – it was years before Perry could talk about it calmly). The book is anchored in tiny parenting triumphs – getting home with the shopping without being derailed by a tantrum, for example – and an understanding that mistakes are inevitable: what matters is what you then do about them. It is like a letter from a wise friend who happens to have done years of research, and – in this culture that will teach you how to take a good selfie but not how to nurture a healthy relationship – can feel like water on a parched plain. Which is perhaps one of the reasons it has spent months on the bestseller list.Perry begins at the beginning – before the beginning in fact, with the atmosphere that shapes the parent and will in turn shape what a foetus will hear and feel and then, once born, encounter. She is vivid about the spectrum of what she calls desertion, imagining it literally, as a desert where a baby cries out for food and water and attention, which is “not a want but a need”. Do parents come when called, or do they believe in leaving a baby to cry, which will eventually silence the cries but will not answer the need? Do they push an older child away with lack of interest, or with contentless praise? Because when a child shows you their painting, they are showing you “who they really are”. Do they dismiss complex feelings as “just tired” or “just hungry”, or “just seeking attention”, creating the deep loneliness in the child of not being seen or heard or felt? This is likely to create adults who “feel real only when they have a direct behavioural or emotional impact on those around them”. Did the parent inherit an “inner critic”, which is now emerging in a different generation?Or is this a place where behaviour is understood as one of many languages, where strong feelings are heard and contained by adults, thus building a deep trust? Such behaviour will also create a default mood for life – as Perry puts it, a vitally necessary “habit of optimism”, which is not the same as happiness, the expectation and chasing of which she sees as a kind of tyranny. Perry quotes Adam Phillips – “the demand that we be happy undermines our lives” – and makes an argument for something far more nourishing: a life of connection, of give and take and light and shade and emotional resilience. Of true confidence versus surface bravura. This is the job of parenting – not the chasing of outward success or surface polish or obedience.In a comment on a recent piece about the bestselling author Dr Gabor Maté, whose book Hold on to Your Kids argues that parents need to matter more to children than their peers do, a reader accused him of being selfish. But he, like Steve Biddulph, author of the bestselling Raising Boys, and now Perry, argues that what is at stake is not just personal closeness, lovely as that might be, but nothing less than the child’s physical and emotional safety. As Perry puts it, baldly: “You want to be the person your child can talk to. If you tell them they are silly to complain when granny made them a nice lentil stew, they may feel they can’t tell you when the creepy piano teacher puts his hand on their leg.”Perry is generous and accepting but has clear boundaries. She is severe about distraction as a tool, for instance – what she calls the “look, squirrel” syndrome, when a child tells you an important thing and you can’t work out what to say, so you change the subject. Using distraction is manipulative, insulting to a child’s intelligence, and teaches them not to concentrate. She disapproves entirely of sleep-training, and of parents habitually using their phones and other screens in a child’s presence – “not only will you be depriving them of contact, you will be creating an empty space inside them. And not to be dramatic, but this is the sort of empty space that may make addicts of people later in life.” She is fascinating about lying (adults should not do it, but children will, and we must not make a big deal of it).The book provides useful case histories and some eye-opening facts: the “breast-crawl”, for instance (the ability of a newborn to find its mother’s breast all on its own) and the realisation that more summer-born children are diagnosed with ADHD than those born in September. And Perry includes bits of rough poetry: to sing with a child is to “breathe and play together” “no one likes to be left to dance alone, even if it is a dance of war”. On the other hand, in her book everyone seems to have a European name and background also, she makes few allowances for having more than one child and she doesn’t, as Melissa Benn has noted, give quite enough air to families under great social, emotional and physical stress – though I suspect Perry would argue that quality of attention must be aimed for regardless. It is hard to read fast, not just because Perry’s text is punctuated by exercises – unpack the last argument you had, for instance, or write down all your self-critical thoughts for a day – but because it prompts so many realisations, or insights, or clearly names things that have until now existed just beyond one’s awareness. And it provides tools, straightforward and manageable if not always easy, that can be implemented at once.

Ian Fielding-Calcutt, the tailor’s founder, and Alex Riley were there to fit suits for senior managers in spite of plans to cut 18,000 jobs worldwide.It embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK and other European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn.Deutsche Bank\u0026nbspfloats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking.Deutsche Bank becomes a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners’ debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself. The bank reports its first annual loss for five decades for the 2008 financial year, losing €3.9bn.An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat – including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved.It is fined $2.5bn (£1.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the Libor interest rate, ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators. Joint chief executives Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen\u0026nbspresign in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank is\u0026nbspfined a further $258m\u0026nbspin the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria.As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution\u0026nbspfaces a $14bn (£10.5bn) charge\u0026nbspover mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice.UK and US regulators\u0026nbspfine Deutsche more than $630m (£506m)\u0026nbspafter finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via \u0027mirror trades\u0027, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly.New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, just $205m this time, for \u0027lax oversight\u0027 in the bank’s foreign exchange business when it was the world’s largest dealer in foreign currency.Christian Sewing takes over as chief executive and after three consecutive years of heavy losses, he\u0026nbspslashes 7,000 jobs\u0026nbspfrom Deutsche’s bloated investment banking arm.Germany’s biggest bank has started the first wave of cuts that some recruiters have predicted could lead to as many as 3,000 job losses in London, where it employs about 7,000 people. Some laid-off staff were reported to be in tears before leaving the building for the last time.“Our timing was not great,” Fielding-Calcutt told Financial News. “I think a lot of the people getting laid off were traders of some sort, who don’t wear suits, and so we just went ahead as normal with our clients who obviously weren’t affected by the cuts.”Fielding \u0026amp Nicholson suits take up to eight weeks to make. Prices start at £1,200 and can go as high as the customer chooses, an employee said.The image of top managers being fitted for luxury suits while other employees, including contract workers and support staff, were laid off was not what Deutsche wanted. Its chief executive, Christian Sewing, visited London on Monday and repeatedly said how much he regretted the decision to scrap a fifth of his global workforce.After increasing their target price for Deutsche’s shares on Monday, Royal Bank of Canada analysts reconsidered and cut their target on Tuesday to €7 from €8. They said Sewing’s ability to execute his plan was less certain than they had thought and Deutsche’s pledge not to raise more capital from shareholders was “walking a fine line”.Deutsche could struggle to hold the remains of its investment bank together after scrapping its equities sales and trading ision. Rivals will be circling to pick off disgruntled senior bankers in London, New York and other markets.Sewing said the bank would pay bonuses to employees who deserved one despite heading for a fourth annual loss in five years. “We are aware that this is a sensitive topic but obviously we will compensate our people according to their operating performance,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3890b87b78a030694fef1f261a2300465a7c0ba2/154_138_3319_1991/master/3319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb4904761ad849a44ed471d782738fa","title":"airbus on course to overtake boeing as biggest planemaker","story":"European firm has edge after US rival reports slump in deliveries after two fatal crashesAirbus is on track to overtake Boeing as the world’s biggest planemaker as the US company reported a slump in deliveries of new commercial jetliner deliveries following two fatal crashes involving the 737 Max.Boeing, which has led its European rival since 2012, is struggling after the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX by safety regulators worldwide following the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating Transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane\u0027s black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from angle of attack sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.In our view, the plane was not airworthy, is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes approximately six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max, but that out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public it is recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines has become the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Prior to the crash, Boeing was delivering planes at a rate of 50 a month in the first quarter. Output has since slumped to only 30 per month in the second quarter. Boeing halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since it was grounded in mid-March.There are more than 150 undelivered Max planes parked at sites around the US as well as 380 owned by airlines that remain grounded. June was the third month running that Boeing booked no new orders of its Max aircraft. Air regulators are not expected to clear the model to fly again before the end of September as the company continues to work on fixing the aircraft’s flight-control systems.Airbus has been ramping up the pressure on Boeing by pushing its best-selling A32neo, a direct rival to the Max, and publicly announcing an increase in production.Earlier this week, Boeing lost a provisional deal for 50 737 Max planes from flyadeal, the budget arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines, which instead ordered the Airbus rival. The deal, with a value of more than $5.5bn, is one of the first direct signs that the Max crashes have resulted in business shifting to Boeing’s rival.However, last month at the Paris air show Boeing was given a shot in the arm when International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, signed a “letter of intent” to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded. The IAG order is yet to be officially booked by Boeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a093afafc836abee08080715ed8b8114e8251f/28_227_3043_1826/master/3043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718548fe87f5382ec46ea0cd91d29339","title":"heineken pub and bar business investigated by pca over beer tie","story":"Regulator to see whether Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars puts unfair terms on market rent only tenanciesHeineken’s pubs and bars business is to be investigated over whether it imposes unfair terms on publicans who try to cut the “beer tie”, a centuries-old arrangement under which they buy beer from the owner of their premises.The pubs code adjudicator, the regulator that has been criticised for being supine in the face of deep-pocketed pub companies, said it had launched its first ever investigation, examining the behaviour of Heineken-owned Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars since July 2016.The PCA will look at whether Star, which has 2,700 pubs, has tried to impose unfair terms when tenants seek a “market rent only” option, an arrangement designed to allow tenants to sever the beer tie but which critics say is ineffective and often has strings attached.Pub landlords who rent their premises from Star will be asked whether the company tried to force them to stock only Heineken keg beer, or an unreasonable volume of the Dutch beer company’s brands, or other drinks in which it has a financial interest.They will also be asked whether Heineken tried to influence the retail price of its brands as part of an MRO agreement.Fiona Dickie, the deputy pubs code adjudicator, said: “It is important that Star tenants and other interested parties provide us with information to support this investigation. Their information will help us to determine whether the pubs code has been broken and, if so, what further action should be taken.”The investigation covers the period since the introduction in 2016 of the pubs code, which regulates companies with more than 500 establishments, including Admiral Taverns, Ei Group (formerly Enterprise Inns), Greene King, Marston’s and Punch Taverns.The code is meant to ensure “fair and lawful dealing” by major pub companies and that landlords are not worse off than they would be if they were free of the beer tie.The MRO section of the code is intended to provide a system under which landlords can escape the tie by negotiating a new agreement with their pub company, with the PCA overseeing an arbitration process.Publicans have frequently criticised the MRO option for being ineffective and the PCA for not doing enough to uphold its integrity.Any landlords who submit evidence have until 5 August and will not be identified in the final report.A Star spokesperson said: “The legislation is clear that as a brewer we have the right to ensure that the pubs we own sell our beer and cider. This reflects the significant ongoing investment we make and the jobs we support in our UK breweries, cideries and supply chain.“While the principle of the brewers stocking requirement is clear, this part of the new legislation is complex and not clearly defined in the pubs code. We therefore hope that this investigation will provide the certainty and clarity that we have sought repeatedly over the past three years. We will of course cooperate fully with the PCA whilst robustly defending our position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f723ce2d6232577e6b789c0aa743dd3ef2c3290c/0_0_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fc2010fc3b011b2c9197a855951507","title":"time for a new poor law elizabethan ideas win economics prize","story":"Family take share of £100,000 award with study of UK’s golden eras of growth including pioneering welfare systemBritain could look back more than 400 years to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I for inspiration on how to reboot the economy and tackle inequality, according to a joint winner of one of the most valuable prizes in economics.Simon Szreter, a professor of history and public policy at Cambridge University, his wife, Hilary Cooper, an economics consultant, and their son Ben Szreter, the chief executive of a community-based charity in Cambridge, were collectively one of two winners of the inaugural IPPR economics prize, worth a total of £100,000.Their entry focused on previous golden eras in UK economic growth that could help revitalise modern Britain.The Elizabethan poor law of 1601 forced the creation of one of the world’s first universal welfare systems and spurred one of the strongest periods of economic growth in UK history.It forced every parish in England to create a fund to support orphans, widows, elderly, disabled, ill and unemployed people, using progressive tax levies that meant the rich contributed most.The Szreter family argued that an economy thrived most when citizens were supported by a strong social security system.The IPPR prize ranks as the third most valuable in economics, behind the 9m Swedish krona (£760,000) Nobel award and the £250,000 Wolfson prize, which was launched in 2011 by the Tory peer and Next chief executive, Simon Wolfson.The other winner was a group of seven workers all aged 27 and under at London Economics, a consultancy, who proposed to devolve greater power to the regions of Britain, including moving 15,000 civil service jobs outside of the capital.The IPPR received more than 200 entries, which were judged by a panel including John Mills, the founder of JML, who was a funder of the award."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19885dd591de3bcdf00135a7393303963260c7b/0_216_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a6d61bd3f369547eca3153fac3901a","title":"watchdog finds work of patisserie valerie auditor unacceptable","story":"Grant Thornton worst performer in Financial Reporting Council’s annual reviewThe former auditor of Patisserie Valerie, the cake and cafe chain at the centre of an alleged accounting fraud, has been placed under increased scrutiny after the industry watchdog called the quality of its work “unacceptable”.Grant Thornton was the worst performer in the Financial Reporting Council’s annual review of audits by the UK’s big accountants. The FRC said half of the eight Grant Thornton audits it inspected for 201718 required significant improvement.Across the industry, one in four audits failed to reach required standards, a finding that will intensify pressure on the firms, which are all already under scrutiny by the Competition and Markets Authority.The audit of Patisserie Valerie was among those looked at by the FRC. Other Grant Thornton audits inspected by the regulator included the outsourcing company Interserve, which was sold in March after administrators were appointed, and Woodford Patient Capital Trust, the embattled investment trust run by the former star investor Neil Woodford. The FRC also reviewed Grant Thornton’s audit of Sports Direct.“This level of audit quality is unacceptable,” the FRC said. “The quality of the audits inspected in the year, and indeed the overall lack of improvement in quality over the past five years, is a matter of deep concern.”Grant Thornton’s chief executive, David Dunckley, exasperated MPs in January when he said it was not his firm’s job to uncover fraud or judge that a company’s books were correct.Audits carried out by PwC that the FRC inspected included Kier Group, the construction and services company whose recent profit warning prompted comparisons with Carillion, and the struggling department store chain Debenhams. The FRC did not disclose which audits were substandard from the list of companies it reviewed.Grant Thornton said it had published details of planned improvements to its audit practice and was working with the FRC to implement its plan. “Some of our past audits for large listed firms have fallen short of the standards we expect,” the firm said.Stephen Haddrill, the FRC’s chief executive, said: “At a time when the future of the audit sector is under the microscope, the latest audit quality results are not acceptable. Audit firms must identify the causes of their audit shortcomings and take rapid and appropriate action to improve quality.”Hemione Hudson, PwC’s head of audit, said: “We are disappointed that the results of the inspection are below the high standards we are committed to achieving on all of our audits.”The big accountants have faced criticism from MPs for lax audit checks that put companies, jobs and taxpayers at risk when large companies such as Carillion collapse. The industry’s critics have accused the firms of not standing up to big clients and the FRC of being too cosy with the firms it is meant to hold to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01def260ced3f2ac361732e6bcd0dae4552657a3/0_156_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6136d185803d09a8913f26edcc469e94","title":"watchdog tells water companies england clean up act","story":"Overall rating ‘unacceptable’ with Southern and Yorkshire Water criticised for pollutionWater companies in England have been warned to clean up their act after the environment watchdog described their performance last year as “simply unacceptable”.Southern Water and Yorkshire Water were singled out for high levels of serious pollution incidents, where sewage is discharged into bathing water.Both companies and South West Water only achieved a two-star rating from the Environment Agency (EA), which it said reflected an “unacceptable level of performance”.The EA assessment of the nine privatised water and sewerage companies in England said only one – Northumbrian Water – was performing at the level required.Emma Howard Boyd, the EA chair, said: “Performance in 2018 was simply unacceptable … rather than improving, the performance of most companies has deteriorated, reversing the trend of gradual improvement since we introduced the environmental performance assessment in 2011.“Serious pollution incidents which damage the local environment, threaten wildlife and in the worst cases put the public at risk have increased.”Although the report assessed performance last year, Howard Boyd said nothing she had seen so far this year suggested any of the companies were making dramatic improvements.She said the agency was toughening its inspections and increasing its audits of water firms as a result of their poor performance.On Tuesday the water regulator Ofwat announced measures that could restrict shareholder payouts if the companies were found not to be financially resilient.Four companies – Severn Trent, Southern Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water – had increased numbers of serious pollution incidents compared with 2017.“There needs to be a significant improvement by the sector to meet our expectations for both serious and total pollution incidents,” the report said.Southern has been heavily criticised for its performance in the past and is at the centre of a criminal investigation by the EA over failures at a sewage treatment plant that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England.The company was fined £126m last month by Ofwat over the failures, which the watchdog described as “shocking.”Last week the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage released data that showed  Southern had polluted some of Britain’s most visited beaches with raw sewage and storm water more than 150 times in six weeks.The EA report also criticised South West Water for poor performance, giving it a red rating for pollution incidents.Category one incidents have a serious extensive or persistent impact on the environment, people or property and may, for example, result in a large number of fish deaths. Category two incidents have a lesser but significant impact. In 2018, the number of serious pollution incidents (categories one and two) increased to 56 from 52, with 48 of them involving the companies’ sewage networks and sewage treatment works.The water companies are unlikely to meet targets to move towards reducing serious pollution incidents to zero by next year. Dr Toby Willison, the executive director of operations at the EA, said: “Water companies need to clean up their act. People expect water companies to improve the environment, not pollute rivers.“We will continue to challenge CEOs to improve company performance and we will take strong and appropriate enforcement action.”Yorkshire Water said the increase in its serious pollution incidents was “absolutely not reflective of the company’s ambition to protect the environment” and fell “far short of the standards required to meet our aim to be recognised as an industry leader”.The company said it had taken measures to turn around its performance.Southern said: “There has been a complete step change in our pollutions team over the past two years and this is reflected in the far higher level of self-reporting as new systems and processes kick in.“We know we have more to do. More awareness training for staff means we are now finding and fixing issues sooner and an improvement programme at all of our high-impact sites is making good progress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37c9decfa353f69dbc8bfb25f7e08159c4521ab/156_0_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d4cba6d33f2cfe3410a37a315e575c","title":"do you live in a city planned from scratch share your experiences","story":"New cities are being built around the world at an unprecedented pace.

Or is there a case for starting afresh?People have been building new cities from scratch for millennia. From the foundation myths surrounding Athens and Rome, to the clearance of virgin forests in western New York state to create the “garden city” of Buffalo, to scores of purpose-built capitals – Brasília, Canberra, Astana, Washington DC – building new cities is just something that humans do.When countries rise up, when markets emerge, people build new cities. Today, though, we are taking it to unheard-of levels. We have never before built so many new cities in so many places at such great expense as we are right now.New dots have been popping up on the maps of countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and India with unprecedented frequency since the late 1990s, and more than 120 new cities are currently being built in 40 nations around the world.Avant-garde developments like Shenzhen and Pudong blazed new economic trails until they eventually widened into the boulevards of a new status quo for the emerging markets of the world.We are standing on the precipice of a new city building boom unlike anything we’ve seen before. These shiny new metropolises hold the dreams and aspirations of people and nations from east Asia to the Middle East to Africa. Will they deliver a bright new urban future or a debt-fuelled bubble of historic proportions?The new city has been sold as a one-stop cure-all for an array of urban and economic issues facing emerging markets around the world: overcrowding, pollution, traffic congestion, housing shortages, lack of green space and economic stagnation, to name a few. By starting from scratch, governments hope to move on from their current clogged and dysfunctional urban centres and develop new economic sectors to help them leapfrog other nations. City building itself can also be a highly profitable endeavour for some.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping.

We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?At first glance, many new cities appear to openly defy economic fundamentals. What are emerging markets – “poor countries” – doing building some of the most technologically advanced, expensive cities on earth? Why is the dusty, remote Kazakh border town of Khorgos turning into what is claimed will become a “new Dubai”? How come oil-dependent Oman is erecting Duqm – a metropolis twice the size of Singapore – in the middle of the desert?“The major reason for new cities is that there is so much migration,” says John Macomber, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who has studied new city development in depth. “People are moving to cities all over the world to seek opportunity.”“The sad thing is that we’re going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth,” says the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer of New York University. “If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have.”It doesn’t take a Nobel winner to see that many of the existing cities of Asia and Africa are simply not able to handle this onslaught of urbanisation. Cairo was built to house 1 million people, not the 20 million who live there today. Cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Lagos, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro are crowded by rings of informal developments. Retrofitting these cities with modern infrastructure and utilities is more complicated and expensive than clearing out a swathe of land and starting all over again.As Macomber says: “If you build a new city you don’t have to relocate or work around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. You also don’t have to work around existing political processes, community groups, civic organisations … or even existing regulations and rules.”“Neoliberalism and deregulation have created a wild west atmosphere that facilitates the circulation of footloose capital globally,” says Sarah Moser, a geography professor at McGill University and the author of the upcoming Atlas of New Cities. “It is easier now than in previous decades to acquire vast tracts of land and to then use that land for any purpose, including urban and commercial.“Technology companies, construction companies, and the real estate industry are leveraging the many challenges facing cities in the global south to convince people that new cities are an important solution rather than fixing existing cities, which is not as profitable.”Development firms such as New York’s Gale International and South Korea’s Posco are peddling copies of Songdo LINK around the world. Architects such as KPF and Arup are drawing up attention-grabbing masterplans lined with skyscrapers, parks and shopping malls reminiscent of New York, London and Dubai. And big tech firms such as Cisco, Alibaba and Tencent are keen to provision these new cities with cutting edge IT networks and public surveillance gizmos.The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of $100bn (£78bn), while the country’s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. Malaysia’s Forest City had its price initially pegged at $100bn, while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking $161bn. Adding up the costs of more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment that can be measured in the trillions of dollars – but the returns are far from given.“Too often a best-case scenario of potential economic rewards is presented and the project is rushed through when decision makers are on a utopian high,” says Moser. “The reality is that new city projects can only move forward with massive loans, often from foreign banks, with no guarantee that the city will be profitable enough to repay the loans.”“Cities have to have a purpose,” Macomber says. “It’s a common mistake that has been made for centuries where a ruler will say ‘Let’s build some buildings and palaces and some things will happen’ or ‘Let’s put up a couple big office buildings and now we’re going to have a Dubai on the Indian Ocean’. Not necessarily. The new cities that struggle are the ones that are pushing against what market forces want to do.”New cities that work have built-in economic drivers that give them their impetus and reason for being. Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border was sparked to life by a transportation hub along the New Silk Road Cyberjaya in Malaysia was built as a concentrated hub of hi-tech firms, startups and educational facilities South Korea’s Songdo is one of the best examples of an “aerotropolis” – a city built around an airport.Other new cities could be described as superfluous – custom-built cities for the rich. “Some of these developments are imagined as the gated communities of privilege,” says Romer. “Like Brasília: ‘The place where we will be able to drive really fast in our cars. We’ll just not let any poor people come here.’ Those things are doomed to fail.“They’re also an inappropriate response to the real need, which is not for the rich to have a place to retreat to but for people who want to get a first position on the kind of urban, modern escalator that can help lift them and their kids to a better life.”Many new cities that are currently being built in Asia and Africa are clearly being designed for emerging middle classes. If provided with the right opportunities, this well-educated, big spending and highly mobile sector of society can be a boon for just about any country. If those opportunities are not provided they are especially prone to flight – emigrating to better jobs and lifestyles in the US, Canada and western Europe.The new city building boom is nearly as much about maintaining and attracting high-value talent as it is about creating space for the droves of rural migrants searching for their first handholds in an urban environment.“Many new cities are scrambling to attract these global elites through creating luxury properties that they can buy, luxury retail and restaurants, and infrastructure for their lavish hobbies: particularly docking facilities for yachts,” says Moser.“The developer’s goal is to maximise profits and this is done in large part by creating luxury condos and villas. There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing, so developers are not interested.”Wade Shepard is the author of Ghost Cities of China, and On the New Silk RoadFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7831ac79d126e480974dbea01d636c3c01d229c/0_362_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c2fa872ca27a8b09c665895e6d3f046","title":"question eu done european funding britain local area","story":"European funding has supported Britain for years. Yet no one seems to know how it’s impacted their local areaThe Angel of the North has been widely embraced as a totem of the north-east since its 1998 installation, and having passed it so often, last month I finally carved out the time to see it up close. A small information board at the site, built on Gateshead’s Team colliery, which closed in 1974, features an explanation from the sculptor, Antony Gormley, that the angel honours the region’s heavy industrial past while aspiring towards a renewed economic future. A little detail is included about Gateshead council’s difficulties in raising the £800,000 needed for its monument to regeneration, and in the bottom lefthand corner of the board is a tiny blue and yellow symbol of one organisation that came up with the cash: the European Union.In June 2016, a majority of people in the north-east, including Gateshead, voted to leave the EU, against the advice of their local authorities, trade unions, business organisations, major political parties, universities and local employers such as the carmaking giant Nissan. All argued that the region’s progress towards economic renewal, which has made it a net exporter to the EU largely due to Nissan, would be severely disrupted by Brexit. But in a region that had suffered such prolonged industrial decay, the message simply didn’t cut through. There was and still is little clear appreciation of answers to the basic question: “What has the EU ever done for me?”One worker at the Nissan factory told me he voted leave because the north-east got “bugger all money” from the EU. This despite Nissan alone benefiting from huge European regional development fund (ERDF) grants and, in just the eight years before the referendum, £450m in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB). It is difficult to believe that the referendum would have swung the same way had more prominence been given over the decades to the EU’s concrete contribution, particularly to rebuilding efforts in regions suffering economic decline.The Newcastle Chronicle did run an article in June 2016 detailing the EU’s funding of regeneration landmarks, including the Sage music venue and Baltic art gallery on the Gateshead side of the Tyne, and the Millennium Bridge over to the Newcastle side. Economic development projects qualified for millions in European grants, including infrastructure works on the Tyne’s north bank, and the old Swan Hunter shipyard’s transformation into a centre for developing offshore energy, subsea and marine industries.The Liverpool Echo did the same exercise, listing 17 transformative developments, including of formerly derelict land around Lime Street station, major improvements to Liverpool John Lennon airport, and the arena and convention centre on the waterfront. Merseyside qualified for £1.6bn “Objective One” EU funding between 1994 and 2013 to try to haul it out of decline.But those were isolated local newspaper efforts amid years of misinformation and a void of basic information. That Boris Johnson and his Vote Leave campaign got away with quoting an imaginary £350m weekly contribution to the EU without acknowledging the £5.6bn rebate or the annual £4bn invested back into the UK illustrated the general lack of knowledge about the basics of membership. The European funding system has always been valued by regional leaders because it is objective, and based on the actual regeneration need. More money per head is available for “less developed” regions, as Merseyside was.Currently almost the whole of Wales and Cornwall qualifies, while large parts of the north-east, north-west, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Yorkshire and Humberside are classed as “transition” regions for investment. EU “structural funding” – from the ERDF and European Social Fund – was worth approximately £10bn to the UK between 2007 and 2013, and approximately £11bn is allocated from 2014 to 2020, with a further £25bn available for rural development and agriculture.It is true of course that the UK – along with France, Germany and six other wealthier EU countries – is a net contributor to the EU, according to the long-agreed aim of raising living standards across the continent to help build peace, stability and a more prosperous single market that benefits all countries.And even while the UK turns its back on the EU it still – if you can find the corner of its website – hails the “achievements” of ERDF funding, saying that from 2007 to 2013 “billions of pounds were invested into local projects”, creating 131,375 jobs. It even publishes a little booklet, Supporting Local Growth, citing many successful investments across the country.This government’s idea for replacing that whole investment structure has struggled to clear the sketch-on-napkin stage under Theresa May, and barely been mentioned in Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s unedifying Tory leadership campaigns. A consultation on the “shared prosperity fund” promised to be completed by the end of 2018 never began, and the fund remains imaginary.Even now, before it really is too late, the benefits to Britain of being in the EU need to be explained positively and clearly, not pushed to the fringes of understanding, like the tiny symbol beneath the Angel of the North."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ef10fc3ea5470f38bec027afe3f1332a8a79ca/0_144_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=017e9edb1ff91fe1ca034ffb3f9bcbcf","title":"sweden parental leave corporate pressure men work","story":"New parents are given 240 days off between them – but corporate pressure means it’s men who then return to workBorn and raised in Sweden by Polish migrants, I was always taught to cherish and appreciate Sweden’s welfare system. It was something to be proud of when looking outward to the rest of the world. Just as Swedish, however, is the traditional family unit. I grew up surrounded by families with mothers who ran the household, as if things were just meant to be that way. Television advertisements always seemed to show the working man with his supportive wife. But as I grew older I started questioning some of this: for all the glorification of the “Swedish model”, welfare didn’t amount to equality. What had long appeared to be a forward-thinking, modern society in fact delivered some obvious contradictions.Take the issue of parental leave: Sweden is consistently ranked as one of the best countries in the world on this measure. After the birth of a child, both parents are eligible for a total of 240 days’ leave. I never gave this much thought until I returned to Scandinavia after living overseas for several years, and saw how all my female friends and colleagues who had started families were limiting their professional careers and slipping into gender roles reminiscent of past generations. Given that they had the freedom to choose, what explained the fact those traditional gender roles were so entrenched? And why was it that, despite having one of the world’s most gender-equal systems, mothers were not re-entering the workforce at the same rate as men after parental leave? Could it be that a welfare system taking care of material needs had paradoxically produced a degree of complacency that allowed outmoded, conservative social expectations to prosper?In a safe, stable and wealthy country such as Sweden, conforming comes naturally. Things work well if you follow the line. The Swedes have a word for this: “lagom”: neither too much nor too little of anything. Government policies allow for flexibility in how couples decide to use postnatal benefits: while both parents are entitled to 240 days’ leave, 90 of those days are earmarked as a minimum for each parent, and the remaining 150 days can be transferred to the other parent upon consent. This is where traditional expectations seem to come into play. According to a report in the Nordic Labour Journal, mothers often take the majority of that flexible leave. There seem to be two reasons for this: traditional gender dynamics within couples, and corporate expectations in which workplaces pressure fathers to take only those weeks specifically allotted to them.So while family-friendly policies make Sweden stand out, they do not guarantee a more progressive view of a woman’s place in society. And with current politics being influenced by rightwing forces, there is a trend towards returning “traditional family values” to the fore, as if preserving national pride hinged on this. Against that backdrop, there is a risk that rights once thought well protected might be reversed.One way of preventing a traditional ision of roles from becoming further embedded could be to simply change policies. Anne Lise Ellingsæter, a professor at Oslo University, has argued for a dual parental leave model: parents of a newborn baby would be provided with an equal number of weeks, none of which would be transferable. But limiting flexibility might also mean limiting people’s ability to choose what is right for them. Instead, perhaps we need to look at educating families in gender equality, rather than taking choices away from them. Providing information about the benefits of equally ided parental leave, childcare and duties in the home would be a more sustainable solution.Because their country is so often cast in a positive light on social issues, many Swedes find it difficult to express dissatisfaction, for fear of sounding ungrateful. This leaves us with a catch-22 situation, where the inequalities that exist are brushed to one side and never debated, because “we’re lucky enough with things as they are”.Yet change is happening at a grassroots level. I recently came across a set of Swedish-language Instagram accounts dedicated to educating women (and men) about equality, family life and gender norms. One such account, @mansbebisar (translation: man babies) has gained a following of more than 70,000 people in just 18 months since its launch. The posts make it clear that Swedish households are anything but equal: women still take on the majority of the workload in the home, care for their children and project-manage the family. They also shed light on how taking up the bulk of parental leave means women find themselves financially disadvantaged – a frequent topic in social media discussions.Accounts such as these help women and men understand how they need to change. It’s as if progress was being mapped out by digital communities before – hopefully – reaching the political realm. There’s no denying family policies are better in Sweden than in many other countries. But to think there’s no room for improvement would be foolish. The Swedish model shouldn’t be seen as perfect, but rather as a good indicator both of what works and what steps still need to be taken on the long journey towards a truly gender-equal society.• Madelaine Gnewski is a Swedish journalist based in Copenhagen"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a8680fdd0c59bd58711d531c0b5540c7eb85ba/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23672d733e0cfc3597687578214a61d1","title":"westminster uk recession looms","story":"Politicians and pundits may be distracted, but economists are already talking about another financial crisisGod bless Britain’s political class, for in their capacity for happy self-absorption they are as reliably easy to please as a puppy. Just chuck them the right chew toy.Who won last night’s head-to-head, Boris or Jeremy? Gnaw gnaw. What is George Osborne playing at? Snuffle, snuffle. Doesn’t young Matt Hancock look tortured these days? Slobber, slobber. And so politicians and pundits paw away, the existential questions facing an entire country somehow never quite as rousing as the latest gossip from Versailles.Still, at some point this summer, a few yawningly prosaic points will intrude. Such as how our tousle-headed Nero hopes to govern with a working majority of just three MPs – and that’s counting on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who have proved to be the most unreliable partners since … well, Boris Johnson himself. How he plans to see off the vote of no confidence that Jeremy Corbyn is preparing to put down, and which may be backed by anywhere up to 30 Conservative backbenchers. How he will secure the passage of a Queen’s speech, given parliament has just sat for the longest session since the civil war because Theresa May couldn’t get one through.However commanding his lead among Tory activists, Johnson is about to form the most fragile government seen in Britain for almost 50 years. What’s more, he’ll do so burdened with one huge problem that not even May had to face: a recession.While at Westminster they dare not even whisper the word, City folk and economists are already discussing the prospect in tones of grim resignation. Speaking in Bournemouth last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of a “sea change” in the world economy. The UK economy didn’t appear to be growing at all, he noted, “and is heavily reliant on … household spending”.The figures back him up. The most watched surveys of British businesses, released in the past few days, suggest the private sector is already shrinking. In the construction sector, which has just had its worst month since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, they now talk of “quicksand”. Manufacturing has been pole-axed, while out in the much larger service sector things look utterly moribund. Last week, it was briefly cheaper for the British government to borrow over five years than for two – the first time that has happened since just before the death in 2008 of Lehman Brothers. Even in a world turned upside-down by central banks pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets, that is usually taken as indicating that a sharp slowdown lies around the corner. This one will be nowhere near as disastrous as the crash of 2008-9 but it will underline how far the world remains lodged in the shadow of that crisis.The UK is suffering an intense version of an international problem. Around the world, central bankers from the eurozone to Australia can see a sharp slowdown on the horizon – and are warning they have little in the drawer to head it off. As for governments: in the US, Donald Trump spent most of his political capital on a tax cut for the rich in 2017, while any European government that defies the rule of austerity risks destruction, as Greece’s former prime minister Alexis Tsipras has learned over the past four years. Ten years ago, China helped save the world by launching a spending programme worth nearly $600bn – throwing up airports and high-speed rail lines within months. Beijing will not do the same this time around.In the UK, as I wrote here last week, Johnson is talking of a hard-right version of a Keynesian stimulus, with tax cuts for the rich and huge bungs for big corporates. That will steal Corbyn’s clothes as the anti-austerity party leader, but it will be of no help to the mum living off a fiver while waiting for her universal credit to come through, or to the teachers whipping up a food bank for their pupils. Not with Sajid Javid as potentially the first chancellor to profess both love of libertarian high priestess Ayn Rand and his total unwillingness even to break off a family holiday to save the steel industry.Put that picture together, and the outline of something truly frightening starts to emerge. A ruling party on its last legs in a political system sapped of nearly all legitimacy. A country that has spent most of the decade mired in the weakest recovery for 300 years – as Blanchflower describes it in his new book, Not Working: Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? – which is now giving way to recession. And a political class that still kids itself it can get a better Brexit deal out of the rest of the EU, or even that it will survive a crashing-out with only a few nicks and grazes.This might make good copy in Westminster, but the turbulence of either scenario will push businesses and families to the wall in the Midlands, Wales and the north. As Birmingham-based economist Paul Forrest points out, in the run-up to the last exit date Jaguar Land Rover announced the shutdown of four plants in Castle Bromwich, Halewood, Solihull and Wolverhampton for two weeks, to avoid “potential Brexit disruption”. Imagine what that employer of 43,000 staff might do this autumn. Then think of Nissan, Honda, Peugeot … and imagine how the speculators will pile on the pound, pushing it down to $1.10 and then below.“My background is in emerging markets,” says Forrest, “and the last time I saw this amount of pent-up chaos was when Russia devalued in 1998.” Should you need reminding, that crisis impoverished middle-class Russians and wiped out the Moscow ruling class.Throughout my adult life, Britain’s political system has got by on bluff and bluster. On ever-cheaper credit for the masses and dark money for the party funders. On half-understood technocratic management by unelected officials and masterful presentational skills by the politicians. On a housing market that just kept rising like an impossible soufflé and the pretence that the Adults Were In Charge. Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron – all of them got by on versions of the same strategy. It was always a cheat, and perhaps the one good thing about the poisonous 2016 referendum was how it illustrated how many people had sussed they were being conned. And now, under Johnson, the entire bluffers’ system is on the verge of disintegrating, with no glimmer at all of what may replace it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

He told Lewis his student loan wasn’t big enough to cover living costs, but his parents wouldn’t help because they believed he should stand on his own two feet. A frustrated Lewis, who has campaigned extensively for the government to openly tell parents it expects them to stump up thousands of pounds to top up student loans, explained that this is not how the system works.It’s essential you understand that parental money has been quietly written into student finance. So, for students and parents in England, here are your questions answered.In the UK the student maintenance loan helps cover living expenses such as accommodation, food and bills. The amount students are entitled to varies, from up to £7,324 for those living at home, to up to £11,354 for those living away from home and in London.The amount you get also depends on how much your parents earn. This means students from higher-income households will get a lower amount. The government unofficially expects higher-earning parents in England to top up the rest – but it doesn’t tell them.If your household income is £25,000 or under, you are entitled to the full loan amount. Once the household income is £30,000 or more you will not get the full amount. For example, if you have a household income of £30,000 and live at home, the maintenance loan is £6,707 with an extra £617 needed. But if it’s £58,210 or more and you live at home, the loan is just £3,224, making the implied parental contribution £4,100.It’s been hidden from you, Lewis says. This is arguably for political reasons middle and higher-income parents – who are also voters – might not like being told to foot the bill.When you get your student loan letter it explains how much money you’ll get, but it doesn’t tell you the full amount you could have been given. Nor will it explicitly say parents are expected to pay the difference. “I would describe it as an ‘unofficial official’ parental contribution,” Lewis says.It might not be an easy conversation to have, but it’s an important one. “Quite often students feel guilty about asking for money,” says Sharon Sweeney, a student funding officer at the University of Dundee. Chloe Aspland, a money adviser at Swansea University, suggests you start by working out how much you need to live on. Many universities have this information on their websites, she says. “We have a cost of living page I refer students to.” Once you know how much you need, you can take the information, along with your loan amount, to your parents.Have the conversation before you go to university if possible, Sweeney recommends. “That way, parents will understand what you’re facing,” she says. “Whereas if you leave it to the time when you really need the extra help, they might think you’ve overspent.”There’s no way to force your parents to give you the money if they can’t or don’t want to. If this is the case there are other options, such as getting a part-time job or financial help from the university. The most important thing is to seek help, says Gareth Pearse, a student support coordinator at Bath Spa University. “All universities will have some form of advice centre,” he adds. “We would sit down and go through the situation. We’d check you’re receiving your full entitlement and help you to access available employment options.”In his review of higher education, Philip Augar recommended student loan letters explicitly say when students are not getting the full amount. But an implied parental contribution is unlikely to be scrapped altogether, Lewis says, so the best you can do is know about it – and make sure your parents do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aac66d520a46c49b7d75bf62982541437d283ce7/0_855_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=614c5f1fd28e68b849295018b6dc0db8","title":"racism in uk universities is blocking bame academics from the top","story":"Universities must be upfront about institutional racism to become fairer places for black, Asian and minority ethnic staffPerhaps one of the most harmful myths about British universities is that they are meritocratic and free from racism. Senior managers can no longer hide behind this false, “post-racial” narrative, which disingenuously implies that racism no longer exists. Perhaps the strongest evidence to challenge this empty rhetoric is the gross underrepresentation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) academics in senior positions.I recently researched institutional racism in British universities by documenting the experiences of BAME academics. My findings exposed the major obstacles they encounter to promotions and career advancement. All my respondents spoke of the way in which racism manifested itself through “hidden white networks” that excluded them from various opportunities. One participant called this a “perpetuating machine” in which white colleagues “co-sign each other’s applications, share each other’s teaching content, and support one another”.The BAME academics I spoke to felt unsupported and “blocked” in their careers. Some cited heads of departments who actively discouraged them from applying for promotions. There was a strong sense that they had to “overachieve” in comparison to their white counterparts just to be considered for promotion. As one respondent put it: “I learned you’ve got to excel to be in a position that a white person can just walk straight into.” Furthermore, BAME academics often felt their work was dismissed as being of “marginal interest”, even when it had obtained international recognition. For example, one of my interviewees stated that the promotions committee regarded his achievements in scholarship on Africa as being “low in significance” because he had published in non-Western outlets and therefore “did not make a significant impact on British or American scholarship”.The problem is compounded by the fact that decision-makers are almost always white senior colleagues, who bring with them a set of white cultural expectations that immediately shut out BAME academics.Concerns were also voiced around recruitment strategies and “all-white” interview panels. One participant explained that despite his strong reputation in the department he remained on a rolling contract for four years, unable to obtain a permanent position. Conversely, his white colleague on a similar contract had more “institutional levers pulled” enabling them to secure a permanent job.As my research shows, the challenges that BAME academics encounter when attempting to progress in our careers are all too evident. We are often seen as being “overconfident” if we apply for promotions, and “oversensitive” when we are rejected. We are presented with patronising management spiel claiming that negative outcomes are the result of the “prematurity” of the applicant, “bureaucratic” decisions, or “failure” to meet criteria (despite clear evidence of the contrary). In other words, white senior management will say anything except the real, underlying issue: their ingrained practices of racism.To understand the root causes of the persistent position of disadvantage experienced by BAME academics, we need better dialogue around institutional racism and exclusionary forms of whiteness. The experiences documented in my findings show that such encounters cannot be simply cast off as “one-off” incidents. My research shows that universities are a far cry away from the meritocratic spaces they claim to be. In order to improve this dire situation there are a number of practical steps that can be taken, but these have to be structural rather than cosmetic.The most important change would be for universities to be held accountable for the underrepresentation of BAME staff at all levels. They should have a statutory duty to report annually on their plans to improve BAME representation, followed by a transparent and accessible audit of their recruitment, retention, and promotion practices. All recruitment and promotion panels must be explicitly committed to equal opportunities and include at least one BAME academic member of staff. These are simple steps, but they have the potential to enable universities rise to the challenge of creating a fairer and more equal space for all. It’s time for British universities to tackle institutional racism head-on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2cbe348b0198d074e7f1ea41fc89f4b871b00df/0_363_1155_693/master/1155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e43d12f68aee848daa8bbb14cf28fa","title":"on the move all the apps and websites you need to boss moves and flatshares","story":"Get the stress of moving under control with just a few taps on your smartphonePacking your bags and heading off to uni is one of those key life moments, when you feel you’re stepping into proper adulthood.

Playful, but at the same time undeniably intimidating. Villanelle with raspberry-pink hair to match her Armani fur coat. Serena Williams at the French Open in a bespoke Virgil Abloh dress with the slogan: “Mother, Champion, Queen, Goddess.” Cardi B at the Met Gala, in a quilted crimson dress so huge she seemed to arrive on her own carnival float. Beyoncé in Homecoming.Céline Dion is the empress of them all. Right now, fashion is Céline’s world, and the rest of us just live in it. From the moment she stepped out of her car into a freak Parisian heatwave last Monday morning, dressed in a sculpted black gown with long, tight leather gloves, a glossy black headpiece that resembled an electrified bird of prey and open-toed booties, it was clear that Ms Dion had not come to haute couture week to play. She had come to slay. When she made her next entrance not just in full Gucci – peppermint and white puff-sleeved minidress, black bondage collar with silver spikes, lace tights and peep-toe shoes – but riding an electric scooter, the penny began to drop that this haute couture fashion week had in effect been rebranded as an extended pre-show entertainment to warm up the crowd for Dion’s headlining slot in Hyde Park. By the time she made what might, in a hotly contested field, go down in history as her best look of the week, in a grand Richard Quinn bow-topped gown, the cool tones of its electric blue and jade green floral perfectly set off by a pair of weimaraner dogs that Dion held nonchalantly by their diamante collars – the vibe in the front row was very much, print her face on our money already, for she is our queen.I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that Dion has completely lost the plot – and, maybe, so have I. That Dion looks less like a woman of taste than a woman who has covered herself in glue and run through the VIP fitting room of every boutique on the Avenue Montaigne. And the thing is, you’re not completely wrong. Dion is not chic in any conventional sense. Her look is not easy on the eye, which is exactly what makes it interesting. It is the polar opposite of the Duchess of Cambridge school of pleasant, flattering, appropriate clothes. She makes no concession to the playbook of good taste, or the unspoken rules about what a 51-year-old woman should wear to catwalk shows that will be headlined by 18-year-old supermodels. (In Dion’s case, memorably, an Off-White “suit” comprising a one-piece, high-cut zippered graffiti-emblazoned swimsuit with a matching blazer, as seen just a few days earlier on Gigi Hadid.)Dion’s wardrobe is about drama – not just for its own sake, but as a narrative. She is her own muse, the heroine of her own story, and she gives herself all the best plotlines. Even when her looks are at their most jaw dropping – we haven’t even mentioned the second-skin unitard with C-H-A-N-E-L spelt out in gold hardware jangling from a chain belt – the most compelling thing about Dion is always the woman herself, not the clothes. In stark contrast to endless, soulless images of women posing in uncomfortable dresses on red carpets with rictus grins and hollow cheeks, looking like they would rather be anywhere else, or pouting with exaggerated boredom in a bathroom selfie, Dion always looks like she’s having the time of her life. This is a woman who really, really loves fashion. You can tell, not just because she clearly spends an eye-watering amount of time and money on clothes, but also because her exaggerated, sculptural camera-friendly poses are those of a woman who has soaked up a lifetime of fashion imagery. She stands for a photograph like one of the iconic couture models of the 1950s, with the swan-like neck of Jean Patchett and the angled hip of Suzy Parker, but adds the wink-to-camera knowingness of Elton John in his pomp. Along with her image-making team – “image architect” Law Roach, and stylists Sydney Lopez and Pepe Munoz – she collaborates with a wide range of designers, rather than being beholden to one label. With a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $430m (£345m) she has no need to play the passive paper doll.Dion’s reinvention from bejazzled Vegas a to avant-garde Parisian street-style star began in 2016, the year in which she lost both her husband of 22 years and her brother to cancer. The deaths came within two days of each other. Later that year, a paparazzi shot of her wearing a neon-yellow Balenciaga gown caught the attention of the fashion industry, and she became a more frequent sight on the front row. Dion’s relationship with fashion feels much more than transactional. It feels, in fact, like a bit of a love affair. She gave a standing ovation to a Giambattista Valli collection and was moved to tears at a Valentino show last year. She takes pleasure in its beauty and its silliness. When she began working with Roach two years ago, he was excited to find his new client enthusiastic about the fashion potential of mining her own pop-culture background for street-style jokes. When Roach tentatively showed Dion a Vetements “Titanic” sweatshirt, her reaction was: “What do you mean, what do I think about it? I love it. I want to wear it today,” Roach told the  last year. Last week, Dion wore another Vetements X Titanic look: a replica of the film’s iconic Heart of the Ocean diamond, over a T-shirt reading I Love Paris Hilton. In May, for an encore after her epic Met Gala appearance in champagne-toned Oscar de la Renta fringing and peacock feathers, she greeted the photographers outside her hotel in a back-to-front Maison Margiela blazer – spoofing her own 1999 Oscars look, minus the white cowboy hat.Last month, Dion’s 16-year residency in Las Vegas came to an end. Having changed the rules of Vegas – Jon Gray, the general manager of the Palms Casino Resort, told the Daily Beast that “Vegas was a place where singers go to die. Céline changed that” – she is now changing the rules of the front row. A recent post on her Instagram showing her wearing an Alexandre Vauthier dress – sumptuous whipped folds of vanilla ice-cream silk, knicker-length hemline, floor-sweeping sleeves – was captioned “Channeling the inner goddess in all of us – Team Céline.” Amen to that. We may not all be in haute couture, but we are all Team Céline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de00c1c9e31a28ba517836c1c7f6fabb06f450e/381_117_1156_693/master/1156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068f5b8969814303ba1626af14d84d49","title":"queer eyes tan france men can have fun with fashion too","story":"The TV star on how the makeover show changed his look – and why he steers clear of a ‘basic’ black tuxThe Queer Eye guys and I don’t co-ordinate our outfits, we all do our own thing, but it’s weird the number of times we’ve all turned up wearing the same colour story. At the Emmys, we weren’t coordinated at all. No conversations were had about what we were wearing we all like to surprise each other.On the red carpet, I really do push myself to look different from how I do anywhere else, to show that fashion doesn’t always have to be so conservative. It’s not just to stand out, but to show that men can have fun with fashion, too. I think a black tux is fine but there are so many other options – why go for basic? I love that we didn’t look like most other men on the red carpet. I made a few best-dressed lists in this suit and my Instagram likes were wonderful that day.I’m much more comfortable in casual clothes and, actually, I don’t dress up a lot. A red-carpet look is usually not as cosy. My personal style is always evolving, but I like to remain relatively classic.

There’s the title, which appears to be chosen via some sort of generic thriller tombola. There’s the typography, which has a crack through it. There’s the cast, who all unfailingly look like catalogue models troubled by the incoming prospect of gastroenteritis.But mainly you know exactly what Secret Obsession will be like thanks to its trailer, which does a very good job of explaining the entire story. A woman suffers from amnesia. Her husband takes her back to their remote home. Only she discovers that he isn’t her husband he’s actually the man who appears in the far left of every single photo she’s in, pulling a sulky face because she isn’t in love with him. Some might even say that she is his … secret obsession.My point is that Secret Obsession looks awful. It’s like something that should be on Lifetime. It’s a cheap, cheesy, wooden, stupid potboiler that hinges on a premise so dumb that you can only conclude that the characters deserve everything they get because they’re all such catastrophic morons. Give it two weeks and Netflix will jokingly disown it in a tweet.Because that’s the real difference between Lifetime and Netflix. Lifetime commits. Last year alone it produced around 70 new films, all of them variations on a well-worn theme. They’re either thrillers (like A Dangerous Date, Lethal Admirer and Killer Single Dad), Christmas films (like A Twist of Christmas, Christmas Pen Pals and A Very Nutty Christmas), or they’re witlessly fascinated with the British royal family (Harry \u0026amp Meghan: Becoming Royal). These films are Lifetime’s bread and butter. They’re clearly not very good, but Lifetime knows what its viewers want, and it’s happy to deliver it to them.Meanwhile, in the same time, Netflix released a similar amount of films. Many of them – like My Teacher, My Obsession and A Christmas Switch: The Royal Wedding – would feel perfectly at home on Lifetime. However, at the same time, Netflix has enormous artistic ambitions. One of those 69 films was Roma. Another was The Other Side of the Wind.Netflix is a catch-all disrupter. It wants to drag people away from cinemas with high quality works of artistic expression, but at the same time it also wants to chop the legs out from underneath the likes of Lifetime. It knows how to deal with the former – by hurling money at award campaigns, largely – but the latter is a much trickier prospect.Because Netflix knows that Secret Obsession isn’t Roma. It knows how low-rent and schlocky it is. And there’s a good chance that it wants you to know that it knows, too, because the internet is key to Netflix’s strategy in a way that isn’t the case with Lifetime. Lifetime can make its films and move on, but Netflix is compelled to draw attention to them no matter what. It’s this exact same identity crisis that led to the notorious Christmas Prince tweet of 2017.You’ll remember that A Christmas Prince was Netflix’s first original Christmas film. You’ll remember that it was entertainingly naff. And you’ll also remember that Netflix used Twitter to single out the 53 users who’d watched it every day for 18 consecutive days, asking them, “Who hurt you?”. Which was not only a creepy use of its user data, but a sneaky way of putting itself above its own content.The blowback from that tweet was such that Netflix has altered its methods a little, now opting for slightly ironic overpraise over outright sniffiness. But it is still capable of subtly shading its own work. Not the big stuff, obviously – Netflix would never crap on an investment as big as, say, Bright – but the smaller stuff, the TV movies, are fair game.My guess is that it’ll only take a handful of What-The-Hell-Is-This memes about Secret Obsession before Netflix joins in with its own ‘it’s so bad, it’s good’ variation. And maybe it’ll work. Maybe Secret Obsession will become a sensation as a result. Maybe it’ll even push people towards watching My Teacher, My Obsession like they deserve. But it’ll leave a weird taste in everyone’s mouth if it does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a759ed6efa33b4fd2d12b8d0761bf1a3176a4a9f/0_339_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22fc11e275055f0a32b71f8d23701f5","title":"arsenal edu football","story":"Arsène Wenger was always so resistant to the idea of a technical director that it never got much leverage at Arsenal until he was gone. But a twisted route means it has taken the club more than a year to appoint their elegant former midfielder Edu. Originally the German talent spotter Sven Mislintat was earmarked for the position before it was whisked away. Then the deal was almost agreed with the Spanish transfer guru Monchi until he suddenly U-turned. Arsenal had to wait for the third man, who has been Brazil’s general coordinator. During the lull the job has not got any easier.Edu, whom the club described as “the final and very important part” of Arsenal’s restructured jigsaw, has an overflowing in-tray. The relationship between player wages and contribution on the pitch is wonky and, even with a few key moves falling their way, will probably take a couple of years to smooth out. Another season in the Europa League has knocked the plans to boost the team ambitiously, the image and the bank balance on to the back burner. Unai Emery has one more year on his contract with another year option, so this season feels critical in terms of how his method of leadership is perceived.In a more general way Edu might also turn his thoughts to something the former CEO Ivan Gazidis once called “Arsenalisation” – fostering a certain spirit and identity. But while Gazidis sounded like a PR man, spouting mottos such as “Together”, Edu knows from his playing days as a member of Arsenal’s Invincible squad how it felt when the club stood for something that had genuine substance and style. He brings a fierce sense of that old Arsenal ethos. As a man he is blessed with great natural charm but behind the smile he does not suffer fools.Edu has been earmarked to oversee Arsenal’s direction in the bigger picture, which is just as well as it is unrealistic to expect someone to come in and make a difference to the immediate issues at hand. With precious few weeks of a maddeningly difficult transfer window left to negotiate, the fascination lies in how critically he assesses Arsenal’s current operation and how much he feels he can do about it.Will he just fit in with the self-sustaining model they have preached for years or might he seek to shake up the status quo by asking some big questions of the owners, Stan Kroenke and his KSE organisation? How will he judge the work of Emery, a manager he played under at Valencia for a season? Does he have any bright ideas or connections to energise the squad very quickly and with a minimal financial outlay? Does he know how to get hold of a magic wand?Arsenal leave for their tour of the United States on Thursday and Edu has arrived from victory with Brazil in the Copa América in time to catch the plane. He will get to make some connections with Kroenke and Kroenke’s son Josh as the first match takes place against KSE’s local team, Colorado Rapids. Edu will get his first close look at the bones of the squad. Although some of the players will return later because of international duty, the bulk of last season’s fifth-placed Premier League side remains.There is no question that Arsenal are under pressure to address the shortcomings but that task became thornier the moment the team buckled at the end of last season to miss two opportunities to earn Champions League football. Arsenal are handcuffed by the fact they are as keen to offload high-earners whose performances do not justify star status as they are eager to refresh with younger, emerging talent. The targeting of teenagers such as Gabriel Martinelli and William Saliba demonstrate how the concept of signing players they hope can become great, and valuable, before they are unaffordable is sound. But Arsenal have to try to deal with the present as well as the future.It feels as if the head of football, Raúl Sanllehí, has been hard at it trying to tap away at this transfer window with the world’s smallest nut cracker. It is not easy to find new clubs for players Emery includes more by obligation than desire. An outlay of more than £600,000 per week on Mesut Özil, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Shkodran Mustafi, none of whom provided consistency or efficiency last season, has become burdensome but without freeing some of that up Sanllehí cannot be ruthless in tying up deals for recruits.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThere are holes in the squad with the departures of Petr Cech, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck. In addition Arsenal need more quality at centre-back, from wide positions, and perhaps another option in central midfield. The club can lean on their faith in the youth system to plug some of those gaps, and Edu can consult with his old teammate Freddie Ljungberg for the lowdown on who is best placed to make an impact on the first team.But some arrivals are essential. When Edu the Arsenal player left for Valencia in 2005 he walked out of Highbury’s marble halls leaving behind a squad so vibrant that they had completed an unbeaten season the year before and would reach the Champions League final the year after. Edu the technical director will arrive back in London to a quite different environment on and off the pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/449b56436ad921eb74bc3dee032cb66e47b12b0b/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced3d15345bd2b1dc0c4915dd813ae09","title":"flying feet tattoos and chicken masks copa america 2019 in pictures","story":"Five years after hosting the World Cup, Brazil again was home to a major competition this time the Copa América with 12 teams competing over 26 matches.

If only he’d have set this out in December, when Theresa May was struggling to get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament. The whole approach by everyone would have been different for the first half of 2019, and we wouldn’t be facing the imminent threat of Boris Johnson as PM. SimonLegendThis is just a different way of sitting on the fence. The indecision and confusion continue. PaperAxeLabour has actually always been remarkably consistent about its Brexit policy. People may not like Labour’s Brexit policy, they may wish that it were different. Plenty of people within the party fall into those categories. But it is just disingenuous to say that Labour doesn’t have a position or that its position is unclear.Corbyn is just spelling out what has been said many times before: the ideal scenario is a general election, a Labour victory and Brexit on Labour’s terms. Failing that, a second referendum and backing remain (for now). PortalooCorbyn has done the right thing in finally coming out in support of remain in a second referendum. If a handful of Tories stick with their principles and vote with Labour a second referendum would hopefully give us a clear remain vote. Pull us back from the last three years of utter madness that have alienated us from allies and weakened the fabric of society that binds us all. Kingpin300Labour’s so-called policy change on Brexit is no such thing. Their policy is still to back a Labour Brexit deal but oppose a Tory Brexit deal. We’ve known that for some time. Labour didn’t back May’s EU withdrawal agreement, and backed amendments for another referendum in parliament.To say that Labour will oppose a Tory Brexit, but support a Labour Brexit deal, is simply no change at all. BudaneveyThe absolute proof of the pudding for Labour – and the only way they will win back support – is to now be seen to actively and aggressively promote a second referendum as a solution. Simply announcing it as a policy position and then going back to talking about buses is not anywhere near enough. There has to be genuine commitment. SmallHeathernThe fact that in July 2019, Labour feels it has to state they would campaign for remain against no-deal or a Tory deal speaks volume about the level of irrelevance they have fallen to regarding Brexit.In the fine print, they also say that in the unlikely event of an emergency landing of Corbyn in Number 10, they would not revoke Article 50 but seek for another deal with the EU (the same deal but painted red). ID7903204I am now watching Labour closely. If this turns out to be what it is trying to look like they may have my vote again. But I am not going to give my support until it is absolutely clear that there is no between the lines Lexit hidden here.But on what’s been said so far, I will vote with Labour in the event of GE. Lynden71I see nothing in Labour’s recent policy announcement on Brexit that’s going to make want to switch back to supporting them. Apart from anything else, Corbyn simply can’t be trusted to see through what he’s currently promising. I’m half-expecting a half-retraction later today, rowing back on the pledge. GalvestonPeople don’t understand that Corbyn coming out and supporting remain will boost the Tories. They’ve been praying for Corbyn to play the big remain bogeyman for three years and he has (correctly) refrained to doing this. This announcement will fuel the Conservatives who still (probably) hold a very slim majority. What’s for sure is that both the Tories and the anti-Corbynites have been trying to set up Corbyn for failure ever since he got the Labour PLP.Seeing the absolute derision with which this is being met in the Remain camp ... it’s quite clear that all the Corbyn bashing of the last three years has worked wonders. Voltaire21Seems fair. Corbyn coming under a lot of attacks, but there is very little else they can do. As opposition, they cannot trigger a general election or demand a new referendum even if they want to, because the power to do so lies solely in the hands of the Conservatives.The referendum should never have happened, and ever since that date, Corbyn and the Labour party should have come out clearly in favour of the half the country that voted remain, knowing what a Tory Brexit would mean. That they didn’t is on them.But at this point, and with a Johnson government looming on the horizon, I don’t really see what else they could do than try to force his hand, which is the purpose of today’s letter. danielplainview"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f60d485527dabd9c4975fcb10abc4d4de3a5ecd/0_152_5485_3290/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=288ee2d37ff67938c92570e8ca26dfa5","title":"wed be better off picking someone at random and giving them keys to no 10","story":"Be optimistic? Johnson offers pitiful object lesson in failing to answer any serious questionsThere was a brief frisson of excitement when someone said that Jason McCartney was in the spin room for the ITV leadership debate in Manchester. No one knew the former North Melbourne Aussie rules footballer and current list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants was in town. Then the excitement died a little. It was a different Jason McCartney. Jason McCartney, the former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 general election and was now delegated to be cheerleader in chief for Team Boris. Point man to explain to a room full of hacks why his man had won the debate. Even if he hadn’t. Understandably McCartney looked slightly overawed by the responsibility.Over on the other side of the room rooting for Team Hunt was another former MP, Rob Wilson. Him and me neither. It hadn’t been meant to be like this. The spin room had been billed to be full of ambitious Tory MPs, slavering for top jobs when their man became prime minister. Except it turned out that the Conservative whips hadn’t quite trusted their Labour counterparts to pair their absentee MPs and had ordered them all back to Westminster for the crucial vote on the Dominic Grieve amendment to force parliament to report fortnightly throughout October. Even then it hadn’t been enough as the government was defeated by a single vote. A sign of things to come.The debate proper began with both men appearing on stage like two contestants in a dodgy 1980s game show. Boris Johnson stared at the floor. A man-boy dressed in an ill-fitting suit. Don’t mess this up, he told himself. All he needed to do was get through the next hour and he would end up as prime minister. “Pifflepafflewifflewaffle,” he babbled. On reflection, taking a large amount of amphetamines just minutes before going on air hadn’t been that good an idea. Jeremy Hunt was in full psycho Colonel Kurtz mode. Eyes fixed and jaw clenched. A cocktail of steroids and napalm was a heady mix. He was the entrepreneur with a plan. The first health secretary to have run the NHS. Into the ground.That pretty much turned out to be the highlight of the entire show – apart from the ad break – with Johnson choosing to treat proceedings like a third-rate debate at the Oxford Union. “I’ve got a four-point plan,” he shouted. No one had apparently told him he was wearing a microphone. “Well, I’ve got a 10-point plan,” Hunt countered. Boris looked rather put out. The fact that neither plan bore any close examination was neither here nor there.Colonel Kurtz then went on the offensive. Would Boris resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October? PIFFFLEPAFFLEWIFFFLEWAFFLE. Was that a yes or no? PIFFLEPAFFLEWIFFLEWAFFLE. We all just needed to believe. In something. Anything. Be optimistic. So long as it included Boris becoming prime minister. When in doubt make a gag. Classic deflection tactics. It was a pitiful object lesson in failing to answer any serious questions. A show of entitled, showman arrogance. In a contest that involved more than 160,000 Tory members, it could have proved fatal. As it was, he could almost say anything. Most of the votes were already in.“Yes he does,” snarled Kurtz.“No, he doesn’t,” snapped Johnson.Feeble doesn’t begin to do it justice. It would have been more enlightening had both men stripped to their boxers and started arm-wrestling. Giant Haystacks versus Little Daddy. The host Julie Etchingham, who was rapidly emerging as the evening’s runaway winner, let out a primal scream of pain. As she tried to stop the two men squabbling, it gradually dawned on her that one of these men was going to wind up as prime minister. The country really was screwed. We’d be better off picking someone from the audience at random and give them the keys to No 10.Kurtz did try to get more serious, but each time Johnson merely smirked. Fantasy answers to genuine questions was all he could manage. No one was more relieved than Etchingham when the clock ticked round to the last question. What quality did both men admire in the other? Boris was silent. As a paid-up narcissist he’d never given anyone other than himself a moment’s thought. “Um ... um ...” he’s alive. Hunt merely mocked Johnson’s continued inability to answer questions. He might once have fancied a job in Boris’s cabinet, but now not so much. An hour up close and personal was more than enough.The closing credits rolled and Boris heaved a sigh of relief. Sure he’d been shit – he’d shown his angry, spiteful, bullying side – but not shit enough to make a difference. The Tory members really were that mad. Just as planned, he’d got away by acting like a guilty 12-year-old caught playing the clown. Over at ITV headquarters, the controller broke down in tears. He had cleared the schedules for this. For this. He should have stuck to Love Island."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cfd6ef7158677fe2ba3e481a4c61061f62d49e3/0_0_6585_4390/master/6585.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cf879c86656f9ceac03c06feadd66990 1400w","title":"england world cup ben stokes cricket","story":"• All-rounder wants revenge for defeat by Australia at Lord’s• Stokes: ‘Beating them is that touch better than any other team’Ben Stokes wants England to secure World Cup redemption against the team they love to beat the most, having described the box office semi-final against Australia on Thursday as the biggest match of their careers to date.Eoin Morgan’s England players are looking to become the first to reach a World Cup final since Graham Gooch’s class of 1992 and deliver a return on four years of heavy investment in the 50-over side. To do so, however, they must also inflict Australia’s first defeat at the semi-final stage.History is with the five-time champions. In their past four World Cup encounters Australia have claimed the spoils, including the 62-run group stage win at Lord’s a fortnight ago that threatened to derail England’s campaign. But Stokes, who raged against that defeat with a defiant 89, fancies revenge is now on the cards.Asked after training on Tuesday whether the World Cup semi-final is the most important game of his life, Stokes replied: “Yes, to date. Definitely. It’s a massive occasion for us as players and as a nation.“Playing against Australia is a big occasion in any sport. The rivalry goes way back and we have the Ashes this summer too. Beating them is that touch better than any other team.“Losing to them at Lord’s was massively disappointing, so I think there will be a bit of redemption for that, knowing we have the chance to beat them and reach that final.”On his own typically full throttle approach to pre-match preparation, Stokes said: “I’m not letting up because this is the crucial moment. We don’t have another game. Lose this and we’re out.”There is no sense of redemption on a personal level, however, with Stokes insisting he is not fuelled by a desire to repay Morgan, his teammates and fans for their support following the 2017 Bristol incident.Instead the all-rounder’s strong form – he has averaged 54 with the bat and 29 with the ball during the tournament – is simply about helping to turn England’s hard-earned status as the world’s No 1 team into silverware.Stokes said: “It opened my eyes up to a lot of things, two years ago, but I don’t have to prove anything to anyone. It’s just showing I can deliver on the biggest stage. Winning is the most important thing and, if you can help the team out with an inidual performance, that’s all that counts. People can say good things, bad things ... it just won’t bother me.”Attention will again be on the reception for Steve Smith and David Warner at Edgbaston, with Australia’s two leading batsmen having been booed throughout the World Cup following year-long bans for the ball-tampering scandal last year.Morgan, the captain, insisted before Lord’s it was not his place to issue instructions to supporters, a stance Stokes has backed. But as a teammate of Smith in the Indian Premier League, and having seen Warner deliver three centuries this tournament, there is admiration for the pair also.“I sit with Morgs on it, it’s up to the crowd. But respect to them for dealing with the on-field pressures and the crowds while still delivering.”Stokes put his own returns with the bat down to growing experience of all conditions and situations, while his seven wickets have come by looking to dry up the runs – rather than send down magic deliveries – following a clarification of his role with Morgan.The 28-year-old is expected once again to be part of a five-man England seam attack augmented by Adil Rashid’s leg-spin, with Liam Plunkett having proved indispensable in the middle overs and still unbeaten, personally, after missing the defeats by Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia.On Australia’s semi-final record of six wins (and a tie that secured their progress to the final in 1999), Plunkett said: “It’s experience. They’ve been there done it. Not against this bunch of players, obviously. We’re a different sort of animal compared to our last teams. We’ve played well over the last four years. We’ve been ranked No1 and we’re feeling in a good place. They’re a great team but we feel on our day we can beat anyone in the world.“With what’s to come after it, a World Cup final, it’s huge. It would be nice to finish the four years leading up to the World Cup by winning it. We don’t ‘deserve’ it – no one ‘deserves’ to win it – but we deserve to be in the semi-final and give it our best shot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584c69166b250cd229f6b30a44a32876b34ec672/498_93_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24b198765348af414e99669cb903b63","title":"lando norris new mclaren contract f1 carols sainz","story":"Lando Norris has had his contract with McLaren extended to continue racing for the team for a further three years.McLaren have shown their confidence that Norris will be central to their efforts to return to the front of the grid by announcing they will retain him before his home race, the British Grand Prix. The team have also extended the contract of his teammate, Carlos Sainz.Norris, who is still only 19, was first signed by McLaren as a junior driver in 2017. He tested their car that year and while competing in F2 last season was the team’s reserve driver. His performances on promotion to a full race seat have proved his credentials as a potential future starof the sport .“It’s good to see McLaren have faith in me and back up what they’ve said in that I have been doing a good job so far,” he said. “I wasn’t pushing for it. I wasn’t saying I want the deal done by Silverstone. It was out of the blue last week. It doesn’t change too much because I wasn’t thinking about it, or worried about it, but it gives me a bit more confidence.”Norris has out-qualified his more experienced teammate Sainz six to three so far this season and has shown maturity, tenacity and finesse. He has remained optimistic in the face of two mechanical failures, reacted well to playing the team game in Monaco and did not seem at all intimidated by going wheel to wheel with the world champions Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raïkkönen. He has scored two sixth-place finishes – in Bahrain and at the last round in Austria.McLaren’s chief executive, Zak Brown, wanted to ensure there would be stability in the team’s lineup. “Lando is in a good place, so as he gets more successful, and we get more successful, we all win together,” he said. “Given how well Lando and Carlos are doing, it was in our best interest that as silly season ramps up, we have our head down, we know what we’re doing next year, and this announcement is to end speculation or potential activity.”McLaren are in the process of rebuilding after a period of underperformance and are beginning to display some of the form that has returned eight constructors’ and 12 drivers’ championships. They are fourth in the championship, the best of the midfield teams and 20 points in front of fifth-placed Renault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3532e90cf964cb83128d50ce2dcda297dff55c/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6424368f1ff6d19b41bb751c2d617d","title":"netball world cup 2019 team by team guide","story":"A strong England team look well placed to claim a first world title but Australia and Jamaica will challenge stronglyCoach: Lisa Alexander.Form guide: After a disappointing silver medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Diamonds are desperate for gold. However, they are unlikely to find much competition in the group stages and gaining experience in close games is key for them to perform when it counts. Lisa Alexander has been happy with the fitness of her players, but the form of some – most notably the captain, Caitlin Bassett – in the Super Netball competition has been worrying and they do not look like a team with the same edge they had in 2015. With nine players making their World Cup debut, Australia’s squad is the least experienced of the top five nations – but having all 12 of their players competing in the world’s premier domestic competition is their key advantage.Key player: Liz Watson leads an inexperienced midcourt and her ability to transition the ball down the court will be vital to the Diamonds’ chances.Form guide: Much has been made of the former Australian men’s player Dan Ryan being appointed as Northern Ireland’s head coach. Although Ryan’s form with the Adelaide Thunderbirds in Australia was less than stellar, he has had previous success in the UK Superleague coaching Manchester Thunder. Northern Ireland performed solidly at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and will be looking to finish higher than their current eighth-place world ranking. If Ryan uses his tactical nous to target games against teams who are vulnerable because of injury, this group has the ability to cause some upsets.Key player: Fionnuala Toner is a tough and versatile defender who can swing between wing defence and goal defence and be a game changer when it matters.Form guide: It hasn’t been the smoothest start for the African nation who named their final 12 on 3 July – only nine days before the start of the tournament. Competing in their first World Cup, they are something of an unknown quantity and will look to capitalise on that against higher ranked teams.Key player: Adelaide Muskwe brings some much needed experience to this team – a speedy defender who plays for Severn Stars in the UK’s Superleague.Form guide: After winning the 2018 Asian Championships, Sri Lanka will come into the World Cup with confidence but will need to show a great deal of resilience to pick themselves up after the pool stages and the impact of coming up against the world No 1 in Australia.Key player: Chathurangi Jayasooriya’s anticipation in defence will be key to Sri Lanka creating turnovers when the ball is coming at them fast.Form guide: If you’re wondering where you’ve seen this squad list before, it was probably at the 2015 World Cup. For a team with little success in the past four years the decision to make very few changes and bank on experience is interesting. Fortunately they have been blessed with a kind draw, which means they will be unlikely to come up against South Africa. With only Australia and a depleted Malawi to trouble them, they are almost guaranteed a place in the semi-finals. While it is never wise to write off a Noeline Taurua-coached team, they will need to get a lot out of their battle-worn lineup in order to finish with a medal.Key player: Laura Langman can turn New Zealand’s form around. If she has control of the game they stand a chance.Form guide: The loss of Mwai Kumwenda to an ACL injury is big for this Malawi team. Kumwenda was the player of the tournament at the 2015 World Cup and her influence on this team is immense. After recording a historic win against New Zealand at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, they looked to have the capability to crack the top four. Malawi’s unconventional structures and short passing game has the ability to throw off higher ranked teams, but they will need to create plenty of turnovers in defence to compensate for the absence of their strike weapon in the attacking end.Key player: Joyce Mvula will aim to bring her form from her recent Superleague spell with Manchester Thunder and be the target Malawi need in the circle.Form guide: Barbados had a tough run at the Commonwealth Games last year, coming away with only one win. They will look to make amends for their heartbreaking two-goal extra-time defeat against Scotland in the ninth-place play-off. They come off a great qualifying tournament and will be confident taking on Singapore in their first match.Key player: Shonette Azore-Bruce is a rock in goal keeper and will be key to Barbados fighting off the hungry attack of the higher ranked teams.Prediction: 10th.Form guide: Ranked 26th in the world, Singapore will not have an easy time of things in this tournament. The team qualified by finishing in second place at the Asian Championship last year and will be hoping to get another shot at their Asian rivals Sri Lanka to try to close the gap between them.Key player: Charmaine Soh was the star of Singapore’s Asian Games campaign, shooting accurately and creating space in the circle.Coaches: Marvette Anderson and Sasher Gaye-Henry.Form guide: Jamaica’s agonising one-goal defeat against the eventual winners, England, at the Commonwealth Games will be fresh in their minds as they approach this tournament. Despite the loss, the closeness of the margin taught them they are within a whisker of being the world’s best and they will be desperate to prove it. With talent all over the court, including four players who compete in Australia’s Super Netball league, they are a serious threat. But a lack of combinations among their key players may hurt them and they will need to be at their best to have a chance of toppling Australia or England. If they can get quality ball into the shooter Jhaniele Fowler they will be hard to stop.Key player: Shamera Sterling has been the talk of Australia’s Super Netball and her ability to pull off amazing intercepts will be vital for Jamaica.Form guide: A deeply unlucky draw puts the Proteas in the tough situation of needing to beat either England or Jamaica to make the semi-finals. Had they found themselves up against New Zealand they would have been more confident, but the other side of the draw doesn’t look so friendly for the South Africans. However, they will take some confidence from a win against England in the Quad Series in January and no doubt Norma Plummer has some tricks up her sleeve. The team also benefit from having six players in Australia’s Super Netball this season, including their defensive combination playing together for the Sunshine Coast Lightning.Key player: Karla Pretorius is quite simply one of the best players in the world at the moment. She can be the difference for South Africa.World Cup best: 1st, 1979 (joint winners with Australia and New Zealand).Form guide: Trinidad and Tobago hold the unlikely honour of being the only team other than Australia and New Zealand to have won the World Cup. After missing out on the Commonwealth Games last year, the team sailed through the Americas qualifying tournament unbeaten and will aim to take this form to Liverpool.Key player: Samantha Wallace has been on fire for Super Netball’s ladder-leading NSW Swifts and won’t let her team down under the post.Form guide: Fiji did not have an easy run at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and despite cruising through the Oceania qualifying tournament with only a defeat against Samoa, they will need to improve considerably. Funding from Australia to allow them to engage a performance analyst should see an uptick in their fortunes.Key player: Laisani Waqa can be a shooting machine – if Fiji can get her the ball, she will deliver for them.Form guide: England finally proved in 2018 that they can stand up in big games and pull out a win when it counts. However, having done it as underdogs, will they be able to replicate this form when all eyes are on them? Australia’s coach, Lisa Alexander, claimed that the gold for England came a year too early and will put undue pressure on them at home. With a good mix of experience and youth, this looks to be the strongest team on paper. But they will face tough competition from Jamaica and South Africa in the cross-over games and will need to hold their nerve in front of a home crowd that have now learnt to expect gold from their Roses.Key player: Geva Mentor seems to get better with age and her experience playing on the shooters of all the top five nations will be invaluable.Form guide: A tough draw will make this a difficult tournament for Scotland. Despite a significant win against Northern Ireland in the qualifying tournament, they find themselves in the tougher group for the cross-over games, which is likely to leave them fighting it out for the lower placings. There is a lot to like about this team, which features only three World Cup veterans and has an average age of only 23.5 years. Although they have a rough path to tread, they will be all the better for it in the years to come.Key player: The 19-year-old Bethan Goodwin has been dazzling spectators with her strong shooting and is likely to be a fan favourite in Liverpool.Form guide: The darlings of the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Uganda will attract plenty of fans at this World Cup. They have the potential to cause upsets early but tend to fall away at the end of tournaments. A likely classification match against South Africa may prove too much for them to snag the top-five finish.Key player: Peace Proscovia is close to unstoppable under the post and will provide an incredible target in attack.Prediction: 6thForm guide: Samoa come in with confidence after a significant win against Fiji at the Oceania qualifiers. Recent support from Australia has boosted the team with a professional performance analyst and physiotherapist to assist in Liverpool. They will have a tough run early but are likely to win their later games.Key player: Gene Solia-Gibb brings experience and sporting nous to the defensive end and will be crucial to her team’s chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c00b84d9b4f7e12e6fb1030f4664e4a82cce7107/0_103_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5dababcbcb080988607cb1da74cd99f","title":"fleabag super producer francesca moody phoebe waller bridge edinburgh fringe","story":"She unleashed Phoebe Waller-Bridge on the Edinburgh fringe. The former actor with the Midas touch tells us her recipe for a hit show‘We had wine. It was late.” Producer Francesca Moody shrugs as if that combination is where all genius lies. Six years ago, she and the director Vicky Jones read a single-page monologue by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. “Someone said we should take it to the Edinburgh fringe.” So began Moody’s journey with the skewer-tongued Fleabag, which brought the country – tipsy, horny and broken – to its knees.It received mixed reviews that year in Edinburgh but word of mouth spread like a super strain of gonorrhoea. It sold out, Waller-Bridge adapted it for TV and the stage version has triumphed on Broadway and become this summer’s hottest West End ticket. “I remember having a gut instinct that it was going to do brilliantly in Edinburgh,” Moody says, “but I don’t think any of us could have anticipated the success.” She smiles and does an elegant huff to camera, sorry, to me. “Frankly, it’s ridiculous.”We meet at Soho theatre. Sitting in her red jumpsuit from New York, with cropped blond hair, it’s easy to tell Moody trained as an actor good posture, well spoken. But she never wishes it was her on stage. “Absolutely not. Terrifying.” She laughs. “I was mediocre at best … This is the job I was meant to do.”Everything the 31-year-old Moody touches seems to turn to gongs. Last year at Edinburgh she won Fringe Firsts for Gary McNair and Kieran Hurley’s playground drama Square Go and Penelope Skinner’s Angry Alan, a flaying of modern masculine entitlement. This year she is returning with Square Go and bringing Baby Reindeer, by Edinburgh comedy award winner Richard Gadd, and Do Our Best, a comedy about grief and Girl Guides.Born in London, Moody studied drama at Exeter University and did a master’s in acting at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Producing happened by accident. A friend wanted to apply for funding from the now defunct IdeasTap, but wasn’t under 25. Moody, nowhere near the age restriction, took the lead. She worked part time front of house at the Royal Opera House (“pointing out where the loos were”) and produced on the side. Jones, a contemporary at Royal Welsh, asked if she’d help her and Waller-Bridge develop the repertoire of their company DryWrite from short-play nights to full-length plays. That led to Fleabag. She spent four years as a producer at Paines Plough, a year as executive producer for Curious Directive, then went freelance with Francesca Moody Productions.I thought producing was meant to be the most stressful job in theatre so throw Moody questions about coping with pressure. She answers as if confused by the idea that any of it is that difficult. Perhaps it’s a desire not to show fault, or maybe it’s the comfort of Soho, which “feels like home”. She’s produced many shows here including, this month, Gabriel Bisset-Smith’s Whitewash, about gentrification, housing and the decline of clubbing in London.Even in the theatrical hellscape of Edinburgh, Moody is not easily flustered. “I went first when I was 17 and have been every year since, working in some capacity.” There’s a formula to it, she thinks. Step one: find the right play. “I need a visceral reaction.” She read Baby Reindeer on the train. “It pulled into the station and I had 10 pages to go. I just stayed on the train reading it. I couldn’t bear not finishing.” It’s based on a true story about harassment and obsession. “Like all good thrillers, it keeps you guessing.”Step two: find the right venue. For Square Go in New York, they went with subscriber-based 59E59. The show was risky because “it’s just very Scottish” but they got the audience to chant and cheer. “Americans love to do that.” At the fringe, it is returning to Roundabout in Summerhall the in-the-round theatre ideal for the boxing-ring setting. For debuts, size is key. Do Our Best is by Remy Beasley. “Like Phoebe, she’s one of those people you just gravitate towards. She’s an amazing storyteller, naturally funny, not afraid to be ugly on stage.” It is at Ironbelly, a similar venue to where Fleabag was. “Somewhere like Roundabout is too exposing for a first time. But 60 seats?” She nods. “You’re not gonna make money, but you are gonna make reputations.”Is it really that simple? “There have been some hairy moments,” she admits. “I’ve had to deal with difficult personalities and make unpopular decisions. When things go wrong, ultimately it ends with you,” she hesitates, “even if it’s not your fault. In those cases you need a thick skin.” The biggest risk is always financial targets. “Edinburgh can be a real slog when you’re not getting audiences. You’d be hard pressed to find a producer who doesn’t wake up occasionally in hot sweats wondering how they’re going to get that last bit of money for the show.”But she never lets this stress spill out. “It’s a huge skill to not burden the rest of the creative team with the worries that go with the financial side,” says McNair. “She kept all that stuff away.” After years of trying to get Square Go picked up, Moody made it happen. “Some people thought it was too weird,” Hurley explains. “But she was just like, this is great, and we’re going to make it.”This time six years ago, Fleabag was still coming together. Last year, Square Go was getting its gloves fitted. “I’m one very small cog in the big Fleabag machine,” Moody insists, “but it’s amazing to know that something that started off as a tiny little show you made with your friends is suddenly in the West End.” Preparing for the fringe, she’s feeling hopeful – and not just for her own work. “The idea that an Edinburgh show could have that kind of success is more possible now Fleabag has made that journey.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201ace3264e351852ddc37b2caf8d221e226139c/0_183_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f854a9ea52e0562728cd544bf21105b3","title":"whisky business how do you drink yours","story":"For too long a snobbery has lingered over how best to consume whisky. Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1954c53914f3703bf6fd19f67e51857aa9aab08b/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc4e66f76df2a0d113a5ec8e53d04df4","title":"uk best seaside events attractions summer 2019 festivals art food","story":"Arts, watersports, concerts, outdoor cinema, food festivals and bucketloads of family fun … Here’s our pick of events on or near the UK’s beaches this summerBoardmasters (from £69 day ticket£179 five-day camping ticket, 7-11 August) is a surfing and music festival in Newquay, Cornwall.

It had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,” he said.Attenborough said radical action was needed to tackle the climate emergency – “we cannot be radical enough” – but also called for pragmatism in working out what was possible and how best to convince the public of the need for change.He said he did not think opposing voices should be suppressed. “It’s very, very important that voices of dissent should have a place where they’re heard and the arguments between the two sides can be worked out in public, and compared and analysed in public,” he said.He found reason for optimism among young people who were “already making themselves and their voices very, very clear”.“I’m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don’t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live and what we eat. It’s going to happen.”Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change – The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. It is yet to be shown in Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fde2f8e4439483d0e6e35c5b7954c4eb4ca2a59/0_84_1811_1087/master/1811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0373278798c905dd8f907fef73d6482f","title":"scream is back but does the horror genre need ghostface any more","story":"The slasher movie has been rebooted once again for the small screen but in 2019, it might not be quite so welcomeIn the 23 years since the release of Scream, the horror genre has both violently expanded and brutally contracted. There’s been been a wealth of films and shows populated by a variety of evils, from cursed dolls to Swedish maypole cults, but those featuring masked villains holding gleaming kitchen knives have mostly faded into the darkness.The slasher movie formula, which sees a group of attractive teenage archetypes stalked by a stab-happy killer, originated in the 1970s but was resurrected by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson’s meta-horror which, in turn, also resurrected the entire genre, leading us to the scary movie saturation we’re now seeing. But slashers slowly crept back to the grave after a string of lesser offerings and, three films later, the Scream franchise followed suit with Scream 4’s underperformance indicative of how audience tastes had changed in the 15 years since the original. Four years later, Scream returned on the small screen in the shape of a so-so MTV series telling a new story of traumatised teens, followed up by a second season and a two-hour spin-off but for superfans, there was a glaring problem: the Edvard Munch-inspired mask and the sinister voice that accompanied it didn’t make an appearance.So other than the title itself, there was little tying the show back to the original franchise and the show quietly died with about as much muted interest as it started with, a schlocky curio that failed to provoke enough curiosity. But like any slasher villain worth his or her salt, Scream is back from the dead and this time so is Ghostface.A retooled, mercifully shorter, new season, titled Scream: Resurrection, is airing over three nights this week in two-hour chunks, passed off to VH1 after spending a horrifying time on the shelf at MTV. It boasts an unusual assortment of names attached, from producer Queen Latifah to a Paris Jackson cameo to a mum role for Mary J Blige, but the most important one of all is that of Roger L Jackson, whose voice gained infamy ever since it taunted Drew Barrymore with film trivia back in 1996. His return, along with the mask itself, makes the season feel more like the franchise it’s named after, even if the plot is entirely unrelated to anything involving Sidney Prescott and her wannabe starlet mother.This time, in a subgenre that’s typically either ignored black characters or used them as first act pin cushions, characters of colour take centre stage with Black Lightning’s RJ Cyler playing Atlanta-based high school football player Deion. In a scattershot opening that half-heartedly plays with first kill conventions as well as giving a strange nod to Candyman, we see a young Deion witness the death of his brother, a childhood trauma that haunts him in the present day. In this Scream universe, Ghostface is fixated on this horrific incident and uses it as a reason to stalk Deion and his friends. And you can probably guess the rest.As an embittered Scream stan, I can’t deny the thrill of seeing and hearing the original Ghostface back on screen for the first time since 2011 and admittedly, such nostalgic giddiness did help me through the show’s rockier patches. In introducing the franchise to a younger audience, the makers are tasked with coercing a new generation of teens into discovering a mostly dead subgenre. The last few years have seen two notable exceptions: Halloween and Happy Death Day. But both succeeded because of specific USPs. Happy Death Day was a slasher movie that was also a Groundhog Day-esque timeloop comedy and Halloween reunited Jamie Lee Curtis with Michael Myers, a slasher villain with more cultural capital than Ghostface given that he’s always the one wearing the mask. Scream has a harder job on its hands and it makes sense that it’s one that’s been quarantined on the small screen with far less at risk.The Scream films were mostly fixated on white upper-middle-class suburbanites, living in obscenely extravagant houses, or in the second and third installments, we followed the lives of these privileged characters as they went to college and then Hollywood, living in houses even bigger than before. Positioning the action in Atlanta, with a working-class “final boy” heading up an impressively erse cast does help to give the formula a much-needed refresh and there are some nifty references to how race affects the action throughout. Cops are no longer seen as a safe haven, black characters joke about the white reaction to being in a horror movie scenario and even Ghostface’s colour becomes a talking point (“His face is white, he’ll be out in no time”).But outside of the show’s up-to-date references (an Uber driver gets killed! Ghostface now texts!), there’s an unavoidable emptiness at the center and it’s one that’s accentuated given the six-hour runtime. Any slasher would feel flabby when stretched out that much (a key reason why so many horror shows struggle past season one) but here it allows us far too much time to linger on the sub-Kevin Williamson dialogue (“We’re not The Breakfast Club, we’re the dead-fast club”) and a glaring lack of innovation. It has its naysayers but Scream 4 arrived with an awareness of how horror had changed in the years since 2000’s Scream. The final act, that saw the younger cast members either die or get unmasked as killers and then die, was a smart subversion of what a modern audience would expect in a genre monopolised by tired reboots. In Scream: Resurrection, we’re mostly going through the motions and even the attempts to provide genre commentary feel lazily reheated.Horror uber-producer Jason Blum, who’s been behind everything from Get Out to The Purge to both Happy Death Day and Halloween, has recently expressed interest in rebooting Scream for the big screen (he’s also bringing back the influential 1974 slasher Black Christmas later this year) but he faces similar problems. Scream arrived in 1996 with both an academic knowledge of a much-maligned genre as well as an ability to poke fun without resorting to mean-spiritedness. Kevin Williamson had clear affection for films that had long disappeared from the multiplex and vibrant, fresh ideas as a result but now, as an audience, we’re inundated with horror, some good, most bad, and so our expectations have changed considerably. The sharp knife that slashed its way into the public consciousness back then has since gone blunt, as shown by this latest “resurrection”, and in order to make Scream feel necessary yet again, Blum will have to cut a little deeper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff2be57c9422a933b85fe65bad142bd65378080/0_129_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af410086f3ed3007c3b45baeed2f0ab6","title":"big sur banner bixby bridge tourism","story":"The sign was placed over Bixby Bridge, which has been featured in Big Little Lies, an HBO show set in Monterey countyResidents of California’s Big Sur are showing signs – specifically a large, yellow sign - that they are fed up with tourists.Over the weekend, a banner declaring “Overtourism is killing Big Sur” was hung from  Bixby Bridge, dominating any would-be Instagram-perfect photos of the scene.The California Department of Transportation was made aware of the banner Saturday morning, said spokesman Jim Shivers. The local sheriff’s department removed the sign within hours. The group behind the sign calls itself “Take Back Big Sur” and is comprised of about two dozen locals, according to SFGate. A permit is needed to put up signs, Shivers said.“Our responsibility every day is to ensure the safety of the traveling public,” he said. “We want to make sure that we don’t have unregulated or unapproved signage or banners within the right of way which could prove to be a distraction to the public.”“The barrier between appropriate and inappropriate behavior, that barrier has melted away in a lot of ways and I think that is a result of normalizing things in way via social media,” Kromland said.The popularity of Bixby Bridge in particular has grown after its frequent appearances in Big Little Lies, an HBO show set in the county. A video published on 4 July showed the heavy traffic traversing the bridge ahead of the weekend.

Other Antarctic glaciers were likely to be similarly unstable.Recent research found the rate of ice loss from five Antarctic glaciers had doubled in six years and was five times faster than in the 1990s. Ice loss is spreading from the coast into the continent’s interior, with a reduction of more than 100 metres in thickness at some sites.The Thwaites glacier, part of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is believed to pose the greatest risk for rapid future sea level rise. Research recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found it was likely to succumb to instability linked to the retreat of its grounding line on the seabed that would lead to it shedding ice faster than previously expected.Alex Robel, an assistant professor at the US Georgia Institute of Technology and the study’s leader, said if instability was triggered, the ice sheet could be lost in the space of 150 years, even if temperatures stopped rising. “It will keep going by itself and that’s the worry,” he said.Modelling simulations suggested extensive ice loss would start in 600 years but the researchers said it could occur sooner depending on the pace of global heating and nature of the instability.Hélène Seroussi, a jet propulsion laboratory scientist at Nasa, said: “It could happen in the next 200 to 600 years. It depends on the bedrock topography under the ice, and we don’t know it in great detail yet.”Antarctica has nearly eight times more land-based ice than Greenland and 50 times more than all mountain glaciers combined. The Thwaites glacier alone contains enough ice to increase global sea levels by about 50cm. Sea level rise linked to warming has already been linked with increased coastal flooding and storm surges.The researchers found a precise estimate of how much ice the glacier would shed in the next 50 to 800 years was not possible due to unpredictable climate fluctuations and data limitations. However, 500 simulations of different scenarios pointed to it losing stability. This increased uncertainty about future sea level rise but made the worst-case scenarios more likely.A complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet would be expected to increase global sea levels by about five metres (16ft), causing coastal cities around the world to become submerged.A separate study last week in the same journal found the expanse of sea ice around Antarctica had suffered a “precipitous” fall since 2014. Satellite data showed Antarctica lost as much sea ice in four years as the Arctic lost in 34 years.Unlike the melting of ice sheets on land, sea ice melting does not raise sea levels but the loss of the reflective white ice leads to more of the sun’s heat being absorbed in the ocean, increasing the pace of heating.Antarctic sea ice had been gradually increasing during 40 years of measurement and reached a record maximum in 2014, before falling markedly. The cause of the abrupt turnaround has not been established."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62221e96befdeebd6a33e0539f90c5f9c23a043/97_0_5158_3096/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d276f4bc039045c079fba8c72825942","title":"saudi press freedom index ranking reporters without borders","story":"Reporters Without Borders met officials in secret to advocate for release of 30 journalists as Kingdom’s ranking falls to 172 out of 180 Officials in Saudi Arabia privately complained about the kingdom’s low ranking on an influential press freedom index, less than one year after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi murder squad.Campaigners at Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Saudis aired their dismay at a series of unprecedented meetings with government officials in Riyadh. RSF has revealed to the  that it held the confidential meetings in April to advocate for the release of 30 jailed journalists, an act that the press freedom group said was the “only way” for Saudi Arabia to assume the G20 presidency next year.The urgent call comes less than a year after Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. A recent UN report into the murder found “credible evidence” that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials, were liable for the killing.The RSF meetings, which included exchanges with Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, and public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb, were kept secret because RSF said it had hoped that Saudi Arabia might release the journalists during Ramadan, but no such actions were taken.“By meeting with high-level people, we can create little movements that create bigger movements,” said Christophe Deloire, RSF’s secretary-general. “We explained how their global image is totally terrible … and we tried to explain that what they have to do is to take action. They will never convince us or the general public that it is legitimate to have all those journalists in jail.”Two RSF officials – Deloire and RSF’s UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent – said that over the course of meetings over three days, several Saudi officials raised concerns and dismay at Saudi’s low ranking on RSF’s press freedom index, where it is ranked 172 out of 180. The officials seemed especially vexed at their proximity to North Korea, RSF said.“They were clearly sensitive of the rating. They consider it purely illegitimate that they are so badly ranked. And we can say, ‘it is because of this, and because of that’. It is a way to engage,” said Deloire.Saudi Arabia fell three spots in RSF’s most recent ranking, which cited Khashoggi’s murder, and the intense repression of free speech by Saudi’s crown prince. It also noted that the number of journalists and citizen-journalists who have been held in detention has tripled since 2017, the year Prince Mohammed, who has proclaimed himself to be a reformer, was appointed as the king’s heir.RSF said that when pressed on the imprisonment of more than two dozen journalists, Saudi officials responded with many of the talking points they have already expressed publicly, including the allegation that the journalists were not being held because of their journalism.New information about the meetings comes at a sensitive time. October will mark the first anniversary of Khashoggi’s murder, and prominent voices are calling for a boycott of the planned G20 summit in Riyadh in 2020.“We consider there is now an international agenda that creates a demand to act,” said Deloire.Agnès Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who investigated the Khashoggi murder, has said that holding the G20 meeting in Saudi Arabia was a “slap in the face” to those who have fought and died for human rights, and that she would urge governments to relocate the 2020 G20 summit or boycott it.On Tuesday, Callamard singled out the US for its inaction.RSF said it took months, and diplomatic pressure to agree the meetings in Riyadh and that RSF was careful not to appear to offer any legitimacy to the Saudi regime’s treatment of journalists. Vincent said RSF relies on a “naming and shaming” strategy when dealing with poor treatment of journalists by governments, but in the case of Saudi Arabia felt that a new tactic could be useful.Two female journalists, Eman al-Nafjan, and Hatoon al-Fassi, have temporarily been released, and two other journalists, who were missing, briefly contacted their families.A G20 press statement issued last year, which confirmed that Saudi Arabia would host the summit in 2020, said the kingdom was undergoing “major economic and social transformation”, which was “closely aligned with core G20 objectives of achieving macroeconomic stability, sustainable development, women empowerment, enhanced human capital, and increased flow of trade and investment”.The statement was released two months after Khashoggi’s murder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7699f2162126e60b6d57f4d3f88b3a7a5da1846d/362_159_2740_1644/master/2740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a21bff23a69f251877b268fbcd4d022","title":"us plans coalition of military allies to patrol waters off iran and yemen gulf","story":"Pentagon’s top general says group of nations would ensure freedom of navigation in Straits of HormuzThe United States hopes to enlist allies in the coming weeks for a military coalition to safeguard strategic waters in the Persian Gulf where Washington blames Iran and Iran-aligned fighters for attacks, the Penatgon’s most senior general has said.Under the plan, which has only been finalised in recent days, the US would provide command ships and lead surveillance efforts for the military coalition in seaas off Iran and Yemen. Allies would patrol waters near those US command ships and escort commercial vessels with their nation’s flags.Gen Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, gave details to reporters following meetings about it on Tuesday with acting US defense secretary Mark Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo.“We’re engaging now with a number of countries to see if we can put together a coalition that would ensure freedom of navigation both in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab,” Dunford said.“And so I think probably over the next couple of weeks we’ll identify which nations have the political will to support that initiative and then we’ll work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities that’ll support that.”Iran has long threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz, through which almost a fifth of the world’s oil passes, if it was unable to export its oil, something US president Donald Trump’s administration has sought as a way to pressure Tehran to renegotiate a deal on its nuclear program.But the US proposal for an international coalition to safeguard shipping in the Straits, which are at the mouth of the Gulf, has been gaining momentum since attacks in May and June against oil tankers in Gulf waters. Last month, Iran shot down a US drone near the Straits, prompting Trump to order retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off. Although US officials had publicly discussed plans to safeguard the Straits, Dunford’s disclosure that the coalition would also seek to bolster security in the Bab al-Mandab off Yemen appeared to be a new element.The US, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have long fretted over attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in the narrow Bab al-Mandab waterway, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.Nearly 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily through the Bab al-Mandab to Europe, the United states and Asia plus commercial goods.Dunford said the US would provide “command and control” ships but said the goal would be for other countries to provide vessels to patrol waters between those command ships.The third part of the mission would involve coalition members escorting their countries’ commercial vessels.“The expectation is that the actual patrolling and escorts would be done by others,” he said.Dunford said the size of the campaign could be adjusted based on the number of countries that commit to it.“This will be scaleable, right? So with a small number of contributors, we can have a small mission. And we’ll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c11bf7d46e2eafd408f75a62e85fd5dcbc87359/2_208_2072_1243/master/2072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac35d1ba65f9eebcb06c262e7da13801","title":"wednesday briefing rivals go head to head for no 10","story":"Hunt accuses Johnson in TV debate of putting self-interest first … climate policy is like ‘Dad’s Army’ ... and how moon landing conspiracies took offGood morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories you need to know about today.Jeremy Hunt has accused Boris Johnson of putting personal ambition before the national interest as the two candidates for the Tory leadership clashed in a live television debate last night. The foreign secretary stressed Johnson’s refusal to answer questions on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and said his rival’s threat to shut down parliament to force through no deal could lead to civil unrest. Johnson in turn called Hunt a “defeatist” and bemoaned his opponent’s “managerial style” and love of detail. The pair also clashed over tax policy, while Johnson gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow’s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. Martin Kettle writes that Johnson “played the Oxford Union smart arse” and in the process showed why he would be “the most ill-qualified prime minister of modern times”. In a related opinion piece, an exasperated David Conn asks why the Brexit debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the large financial contribution the EU has made to deprived areas of the UK. He cites the imperious Angel of the North as a typically unheralded example the famous sculpture might never have been erected had it not been for money from Brussels. But, as he notes, a worker at nearby Nissan once told him he voted leave because the north-east got “bugger all” from the EU.Leak row worsens – The growing tension between London and Washington over our ambassador’s leaked emails provided another flashpoint for Hunt and Johnson in the Tory debate. The former has defended Kim Darroch in the face of personal attacks from Donald Trump, and also pledged to keep the diplomat in place if he becomes PM. In contrast, Johnson refused to condemn the US president. Darroch pulled out of a meeting with trade secretary Liam Fox and Trump’s daughter Ivanka in Washington yesterday and his future looks uncertain after the president’s refusal to deal with him.‘Don’t panic!’ – Britain’s approach to climate change is like “Dad’s Army” and action to slash greenhouse gas emissions is lagging far behind what is needed, according to the government’s own advisers. In its annual report to parliament, the Committee on Climate Change said the government had to show it was serious about tackling the problem in the next 12 to 18 months. It warned that efforts to prepare homes, businesses and the countryside for higher temperatures were “less ambitious” than they were a decade ago. Chairman Lord Deben said: “We can’t go on with this ramshackle system … and doesn’t begin to face the issues.”‘A day for history’ – MPs have voted to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK by voting in favour of same-sex marriage rights and access to abortion. Labour backbenchers took advantage of the ongoing suspension of the Northern Irish assembly to stage the votes through amendments to an otherwise technical bill on budgets. The Commons voted 383 to 73 to extend marriage equality and abortion rights were granted in a vote by 332 to 99. Supporters greeted the outcome as a “day for the history books”. Activists will also be pleased that Nicki Minaj has pulled out of a concert in Saudi Arabia next week over the kingdom’s lack of support for women and LGBT people.PNG massacre – At least 15 women and children have been killed in Papua New Guinea in one of the country’s worst outbreaks of tribal violence for years. Attackers armed with guns and long knives descended on the highland village of Karida in Hela province on Monday morning and began slaughtering people at random. One villager who managed to escape said he returned to the village to find some victims so badly dismembered that they could not be identified.Jewish ‘injustice’ – Descendants of Jews who fled the Nazis are challenging the German government’s decision to reject their applications for citizenship. The group of more than 100 people have the theoretical constitutional right to become German. But many applicants, some of whom submitted claims from the UK after the EU referendum, have been turned down on the basis that applications are only valid if citizenship has been passed through the father. Barbara Hanely is one of them. Her German-Jewish grandfather fled to the UK in 1938 but her application was turned down because her mother married an Englishman. She said Germany had to act swiftly to correct the “injustice”.Rip Torn, RIP – The cult actor and celebrated wild man Rip Torn has died aged 88. He starred in a number of Hollywood classics in the 1960s but fell foul of the industry because of his fierce temper and unpredictability. Most infamously, a row with Dennis Hopper during the pre-production of Easy Rider, the 1969 counterculture biker movie, led to Torn being replaced by Jack Nicholson before shooting began. However, he found redemption when cast as the foulmouthed talk-show producer Artie in The Larry Sanders Show for which he won an Emmy in 1996.Our health policy editor, Denis Campbell, talks about what Jeremy Hunt’s record-breaking stint as health secretary tells us about his suitability to be the next prime minister. Some say he was a success because he secured more funding for the NHS while others argue his treatment of junior doctors was shameful.There’s a scene in the Bond film Diamonds Are Forever where 007 stumbles across what appears to be the staging of a hoax moon landing. While it always seemed to be a knowing joke about the fringe dwellers who thought Apollo 11’s astonishing triumph 50 years ago was faked, the idea that it really was a conspiracy has slowly taken hold. As Richard Godwin writes today, the internet age has fanned the conspiracy theories first formulated in a 1976 pamphlet by a man called Bill Kaysing. Apparently, one in six British people think the landings were staged. Roger Launius, former chief historian at Nasa, says at first the agency didn’t bother to counter the claims but has been forced to do so.

Photograph: Liam McBurney A stack of leaflets in the reception of the Museum of Orange Heritage in south Belfast shows a cartoon of golf club wielding Orangemen marching on to a putting green. “Where’s the 12th this year? Enjoy the Orange . . . and the greens,” the leaflet reads, suggesting a visit to watch one of 18 Orange parades to tourists arriving early for next week’s British Open at Portrush. It is the first time one of golf’s “majors” has been played in Northern Ireland in 68 years. Rev Mervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, says the parades on July 12th, the biggest date in the unionist calendar, attract what the tourist trade calls the “culturally curious”. “They see a parade with colourful bands and banners, and music. To them, it is another Mardi Gras,” he tells The  as the Orange Order prepares for the Twelfth.Sitting in Schomberg House’s Aughrim boardroom – named after King William III’s bloodier 17th-century victory in Co Galway – the Orangeman reflects on inclusion, and exclusion, as the debate rages around Brexit, stirring issues of political identity and nationality in Northern Ireland. He says he has not read The  weekend interview with James Nesbitt but is interested in it given what he hears of the desire of the Northern Irish actor – a Protestant who sees himself as “an Irishman from the north of Ireland” – for “a new union of Ireland”.Rev Gibson says unionists “when they become famous” sometimes move away from unionism because it is viewed as being “on the wrong side of history” when “republicanism has all the romanticism”. “People associate with that as opposed to what is viewed, wrongly in my opinion, as a bigoted and sectarian culture,” he says.This Orangeman sees himself as British but “proud to be from Northern Ireland” yet with an “all-Ireland dimension” given that his father and grandfather came from Co Donegal. ‘Project fear’Rev Gibson does not see any risk to the North’s place in the United Kingdom from Brexit and does not believe Northern Irish Protestant unionists have anything to fear. Talk of a united Ireland as a fallout from the UK’s departure from the EU is a “scare tactic,” he says, while warnings of a no-deal Brexit leading to a Border poll on Irish unification is part of “project fear” or people “playing politics with it”.He describes last year’s visit of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to the Orange museum, becoming the first serving Irish head of government to visit the Orange Order’s HQ, as “pivotal in changing and improving relationships”.Asked about Tánaiste Simon Coveney this week describing the risk of a no-deal Brexit never being higher, the Orangeman, who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, says he has “nothing to fear from politics”.A Border poll on Irish unification may indeed come but Rev Gibson “just doesn’t see the need for it right away”. Neither does he believe that a united Ireland is inevitable. “What will come will come but I am not a doom-gloom merchant, saying it is around the corner,” he says.He argues that the “three Bs” – as Rev Gibson calls “Brexit, the backstop and Border polls” – are being used “to unsettle the constitutional question” and to “create apathy among British people”.“The only thing that will take us into a united Ireland is a vote of the majority of the people. As a democrat, I’ll accept that. I’m not going to go to war over it,” he says. He believes “backstops will come and go” but little will change as a consequence of Brexit or negotiations.“We will survive as a British people here in Northern Ireland. We have faced a lot bigger challenges than that,” he says.“We couldn’t be bombed or bullied out of the United Kingdom. We are not going to be bribed out of it now either.” Rev Gibson questions how some unionists such as Ulster farmers opposed to Brexit for economic reasons could favour a united Ireland. “One wonders that if someone can change their allegiance for purely economic reasons, what was their allegiance in the first place?” he asks.Irish passportsSaying that, he understands how Ulster unionists can apply for an Irish passport for economic or pragmatic reasons if it makes travelling on holiday to Europe or to their Spanish holiday homes easier. As a Presbyterian clergyman, he regularly signs Irish passport application forms for unionists and loyalists, he says. “It surprises me but I don’t think it diminishes a person’s Britishness. They are not signing them to be Irish they are signing them for European citizenship, for the benefits of living or working in Europe,” he says.This year’s Twelfth celebrations have drawn controversy over large bonfires set to be lit on the eve of the Orange parades across Northern Ireland commemorating the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Bonfire builders voluntarily removed tyres because of the risk from fumes but Belfast City Council insisted on material being removed from one large bonfire on the grounds of the Avoniel Leisure Centre in east Belfast. Rev Gibson has warned that further action could be seen by the community as an “attack on their culture”.He sees this year being no different because of Brexit. There will “political messages” on the day around support for remaining in the UK, for implementing Brexit and for the security services such as “Soldier F”, the former British soldier facing murder charges over killings on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. Parachute Regiment flags have appeared next to Union Jacks and Ulster Banners on posts around Belfast and other parts of Northern Ireland. “We’re not majoring on those things. We don’t walk to protest in many instances. We walk to celebrate,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3951852.1562702979!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"need for checks on imports under no deal brexit admitted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney with Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee: Mr Coveney promises there will be no infrastructure on the Border. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe Government has signalled for the first time that checks on some goods imported from the North will be necessary after a no-deal Brexit, though Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney insisted that there would no checks “on the Border or close to it”.Publishing a document on Tuesday that laid bare the extent of the economic and political threats of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Coveney said some checks on goods would be necessary in order to maintain Ireland’s place in the EU’s single market.The Government has underlined its commitment not to reinstate a hard border, but Mr Coveney conceded that to remain fully inside the EU trading bloc Ireland would have to take “some action, somewhere” to ensure EU rules and regulations were met on goods entering from the North.He declined to say where the checks on goods would be but promised that there would be no infrastructure on the Border. Discussions are ongoing with the European Commission, he said, about how to protect the single market, while at the same time maintaining an open border in Ireland.Mr Coveney said the talks would focus on protecting the single market in a way “that limits the disruption of that and the costs of that for business” while also reassuring the EU about the standards of goods leaving the island of Ireland.Position shift The publication of the document, and Mr Coveney’s comments afterwards, mark a shift in the Government’s public position on the issue of checks on goods, admitting for the first time that some checks may be necessary.The shift demonstrates the extent to which expectations about Brexit in Dublin and Brussels have become more pessimistic in recent months, in part due to the Conservative leadership contest in the UK. Both candidates for the party leadership and the prime minister’s office have said they will leave the EU without a deal on October 31th if the EU does not agree to changes to the backstop in the withdrawal agreement.Both the EU and the Government have said there will be no change to the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, but have signalled they are willing to change the political declaration which charts the direction of the future trading relationship.Bleak viewThe latest no-deal Brexit update outlines the bleakest view yet of the political and economic consequences, which it warns will be “highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications”.It outlines plans to try to keep trade flowing through the country’s ports, despite the need for new checks on trucks arriving from the UK. Trucks will not be allowed to board ferries coming to Ireland unless they have the requisite customs clearance and those with animal and food shipments will have to give at least 24 hours’ notice.While officials are confident that trucks will flow relatively freely on arrival in Ireland, some will have to be checked and the document gives strong warnings of likely delays in goods transported between Ireland and the Continent via the UK – the so-called landbridge – which carries €21 billion worth of Irish trade each year. This is likely to be subject to “severe delays and disruption”, it warns. New sea routes are being opened direct to the Continent, but the landbridge will remain vital.The document also said that 50,000-55,000 jobs could be at risk and that a no-deal Brexit would swing exchequer finances into deficit for 2020.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins The Brexit planning document published by the Government on Tuesday is reminiscent of the warnings about the Irish economy and housing market that proliferated in the first phase of the economic crash a decade ago.It is one of the most alarming documents ever published by an Irish government.It warns of “profound implications for Ireland on all levels” elaborating that they involve “severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges both in the immediate term and in the longer term”.It warns darkly of “difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature”.And even though it puts the best gloss possible on the intensive preparations the civil service has been making for Brexit, it acknowledges that even so, there will be significant damage North and South if a no-deal Brexit occurs.“A no-deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications, first and foremost for the UK, including most significantly Northern Ireland, as well as having significant impacts on Ireland and the rest of the EU,” it says. Written in low-key officialise, it is a sobering read.WarningsLater in the afternoon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe elaborated on the warnings in the dry print of the official document.“The truth is we will need to take some action somewhere in our economy to ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the products that are then going to be sold on off Ireland,” Mr Coveney said.Translation: there may have to be checks on important imports from the North after all. But not, he insisted, on the Border. But somewhere else?Brexit game planYes. The publication of the document marked the extent to which reality is intruding on the Government’s Brexit game plan.If the British government has long promised two things which are, on the face of it, mutually exclusive – ie, leaving the single market and customs union while having no disruption to trade on the Border – the Irish Government has been guilty of something similar: promising to protect the single market while insisting there would be no Border checks.On Tuesday that position was refined in a subtle but important way: the Government admitted that there will have to be checks, but insists that it will not take place on the Border. But if not on the Border – then where? That is the question that now moves centre stage in the Government’s Brexit planning.Discussions continue with the European Commission on how to “protect the single market”. But it is clear that something important has shifted in that conversation.Full pictureThe previous assurances – how many times have you heard the Taoiseach or Tánaiste say “There will be no physical infrastructure or related checks or controls” – are no longer quite the full picture. The Government has relished wearing the green jersey on Brexit and standing up to the British with the help of the EU, and has been aware of the political benefits of doing so. But now the pitfalls begin to emerge from the fog.Varadkar and Coveney have often said there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland. That may be true also for the Government. Government Ministers and officials are at pains to point out that this isn’t their fault the hardening of the British position has outflanked the careful compromises and delicate architecture of the withdrawal agreement and its backstop. And they’re right.The British, for their part, say that they won’t put up a border, no matter what. If the Irish and the EU want one, that’s their business. An emerging blame game is already in evidence.But there’s a danger that everyone spends the next two months trying to avoid the blame for a crash-out Brexit, rather than trying to avoid a crash-out Brexit.There’s another question that will surface too. Once the new British government takes office, the focus will shift to the backstop, which remains the biggest obstacle to the acceptance of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons.Intense pressureIf a concession on the backstop materialises – perhaps a time-limiting protocol a legal codicil which specifies a review in the absence of agreement something, anything to give the new prime minster an opportunity to bring the withdrawal agreement back to the House of Commons – then there will surely be intense pressure on the Irish Government to accept it.After all, isn’t the possibility of Border checks in a few year’s time better than the certainty of checks on October 31st? Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has previously insisted that this has to be settled now. But does it really? Varadkar may find he has to make the case for not kicking the can down the road. Politicians usually find themselves making the opposite argument.That is the next phase. After the summer interlude and the change of government in the UK, Brexit will become centre stage in Irish politics once again.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Tory leadership latest: Sir John Major threatens to take Boris Johnson to court if he suspends parliament to force \u0026#39No Deal\u0026#39 BrexitJames Dyson buys Singapore\u0026#39s most expensive apartment \u0026#39for £44m\u0026#39 as he prepares to move company HQBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsWho won the ITV leadership debate?

It very briefly hit that low in January this year in chaotic trading during a currency market flash crash.Sterling’s losses have been compounded by a strengthening dollar after receding expectations of an imminent interest rate cut in the US.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that betting markets were now pricing in a 95 per cent chance of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister. Some investors worry Mr Johnson will push Britain towards an abrupt departure from the EU.There is likely to be more pain in store for the pound. Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, said the currency might fall further “should the prospect of a no-deal Brexit ramp up meaningfully over the coming months.Official data on UK economic output in May, due on Wednesday, will provide more clarity on whether the economy shrank in the second quarter after a series of disappointing business surveys.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The direwolves, too, will be featured.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed.

And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict.

Five other Navy vessels – three Indian and two Emirati – were reported to have been involved in the operation. The governments of both countries provided little information as to what had taken place.Before fleeing, Princess Latifa had recorded a video saying that were it to be released, “either I am dead, or in a very, very bad situation”, and accused her father of severely mistreating her and her sister, Shamsa. These allegations have been strongly denied.\u0026nbspPrincess Shamsa had fled from her father’s estate, near Chobham in Surrey, in 2000. She was seen in Cambridge in August that year before disappearing. She later turned up in Dubai after, allegedly, being forced back home.Haya\u0026nbspin Dubai in 2016 (Getty)In the photographs with Princess Haya and Ms Robinson, 33-year-old Princess Latifa was unsmiling, looking listless. Ms Robinson subsequently gave an interview to BBC Radio 4 in which she described Latifa as a “troubled young woman” who regretted making the video claiming abuse.Human rights groups accused the former Irish president of repeating the Emirati royal family’s propaganda she responded she was merely giving her views after being invited to the meeting by Princess Haya, her friend.\u0026nbspSeven months on, and Princess Haya has herself fled the UAE. She\u0026nbspis now living in London at a house near Kensington Palace, which she bought from Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire Indian born steel magnate, for £85m two years ago.\u0026nbspShe has asked for police protection and has also engaged a private security firm that has senior former Scotland Yard officers in its hierarchy.We can see the power the UAE has in Great Britain, it forced the government to carry out an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, who the Emiratis hate. What happens if there is an asylum application and it’s rejected?Princess Haya, educated at Badminton School then\u0026nbspSt Hilda’s College at Oxford, knows members of the British royal family, including the Queen and Prince Charles.\u0026nbspShe is said to have asked for political asylum and there is also talk of legal proceedings for orce from Sheikh Mohammed and custody of the couples’ two children, a seven-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son. The sheikh has 21 other children with his other wives.\u0026nbspThe princess is being represented by Fiona Shackleton QC who acted for Prince Charles in his orce from Princess Diana, as well as for Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Sir Paul McCartney.Radha Stirling, the founder of the pressure group\u0026nbspDetained in Dubai, who had been in contact with Princess Latifa during her abortive escape attempt and had raised the issue of the disappearance of Princess Shamsa with British police, has offered help to Princess Haya’s legal team.Zelensky represents a clear triumph over anti-semitism in UkraineSheikh Mohammed is being represented by Helen Ward QC who has\u0026nbspacted for Andrew Lloyd Webber, Paloma Picasso, Guy Ritchie, Bernie Ecclestone and Princess Diana’s stepmother Countess Raine Spencer.\u0026nbspThere have\u0026nbspbeen a number of reasons offered for Princess Haya’s departure from Dubai. One is that she apparently found out what really happened to Latifa and Shamsa and felt she could no longer continue to be a member of the royal family and live safely in Dubai.Another claim holds that Princess Haya incurred Sheikh Mohammed’s anger by becoming too close to a bodyguard,\u0026nbspa former British Army officer. One former British\u0026nbspsoldier, involved in the private security sector in the Gulf, says:\u0026nbsp“There were definite rumours of a Barry Mannakee kind around for a while, I don’t know if it’s true or not – the guy involved is back in the UK. You won’t see him in the Gulf any time soon, I suspect.”Mannakee was a police personal protection officer for Princess Diana and allegedly had an affair with her. He was moved from his post and later died in a motorcycle crash. No evidence has been produced to show that Princess Haya was intimate with the bodyguard, who works for a UAE-owned security company.\u0026nbspLast month, Sheikh Mohammed posted a poem on his website, written in a classical Arabic style known as\u0026nbsphija or\u0026nbspinvective. On the theme of perfidy and betrayal, it said: “The era of your lies has ended ... You no longer have any place with me ... I do not care if you live or die.”Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum ‘being detained against her will’ after failed escape from UAEAn entire section of Sheikh Mohammed’s website is dedicated to these poems. They are inspired, it says, from “personal experience, event or situation”. The sheikh stresses:\u0026nbsp“I have never written any verse without it being a reality of my life.”Emirati officials complain that opponents of the royal family and the government are seeking to use personal issues for agendas of their own. Their explanation of the Princess Latifa case, for instance, is that it is an attempt at blackmail.\u0026nbspThey point to an interview given by Helene Jaubert, the ex-wife of Herve Jaubert, on\u0026nbspThe Daily Beast website in which she claimed: “The whole plan was for Herve to help her escape and once he got her out, the daughter was going to get to the dad and say I want $3m or else I’ll tell all to the media. It was a con. It’s a corrupt scheme gone haywire.”Haya’s\u0026nbspfriends\u0026nbspfear UAE influence may see her asylum application rejected\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)The allegation is strongly denied by Princess Latifa’s friends, and by Herve Jaubert.\u0026nbspThe Emiratis also point to links between Detained in Dubai and people such as Shahid King Bolsen, an American convert to Islam\u0026nbspwho served seven years in jail for manslaughter in Dubai, and who The New York Times once described\u0026nbspas “an internet provocateur” for Islamist causes.\u0026nbspThere are also claims from Emirati sources that regional rivals Qatar and Iran are behind stories of royal feuds.The whole plan was for Herve to help her escape and once he got her out the daughter was going to get to the dad and say I want $3m or else I’ll tell all to the media. It was a con. It’s a corrupt scheme gone haywireNo evidence has been provided to back this charge, but there are possible political ramifications to what is unfolding with Princess Haya.\u0026nbspThere have been reports that the UAE\u0026nbspasked the British government to help return Princess Haya home. This is denied by authorities in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.However, it seems highly improbable that someone with Princess Haya’s influential connections in this country, and resources, not least formidable legal ones, would allow her to be simply deported back to the Emirates.\u0026nbspThere are other possibilities of diplomatic and political friction. Princess Haya is the daughter of the late ruler of Jordan, King Hussein\u0026nbspthe current ruler, King Abdullah, is her half-brother.Haya marries Sheikh Mohammed in April 2004 (Getty)Jordan’s finances are in difficult straits. The country is dependent on the Emirates as well as Saudi Arabia, and relies on the millions of dollars in remittances sent home by tens of thousands of Jordanians working in the Gulf.The peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians, the economic part of which was recently presented by Jared Kushner in Bahrain, also does little favour to Jordan, which hosts a very large number of Palestinian refugees. Amman has consistently pushed for a two-state solution, the prospects for which are pushed even further back by Donald Trump’s son-in-law’s proposals. Jordan would need Emirati and Saudi help to cope with problems this is likely to pose.At the same time, Princess Haya, an Olympic equestrian for Jordan, is hugely popular in the country and any perception of mistreatment of her would lead to resentment, which may in turn affect Jordanians working in the Gulf.\u0026nbspThe story of the princess and her departure from the Emirati royal family will have widespread repercussions, well beyond the confines of the High Court in London.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as reducing the prices, it will offer extra discounts to students.The MacBook Air has been updated to bring True Tone technology to its existing retina display, allowing it to adapt to the light around it and make the screen appear more natural. It also had its price dropped to £1,099, and can be bought more cheaply by university students.It also updated the cheapest version of the MacBook Pro, which is 13-inches. That computer has traditionally been distinct from the other MacBook Pro models for not having the Touch Bar display that sits at the top of the keyboard – but it now has that technology, as well as Touch ID, a True Tone display of its own, Apple\u0027s newest security chip and the option to get processors that make the computer more than twice as fast as it was before.Neither of the updates made any references to Apple\u0027s widely criticised keyboard, which is said to be changing with future computers. It is likely that the new models have the controversial butterfly keyboard, though previous updates have made minor updates to try and fix some of users\u0027 problems with its keys.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

But it also included Apple\u0027s new butterfly keyboards, which are now on every MacBook and have received intense criticism from users, with rumours suggesting they could soon be killed off too.The MacBook is far from the first of Apple\u0027s legacy and well-known brands to be discontinued this year. Just last month, it announced that it would be doing away with iTunes, and splitting its functions into a set of new and separate apps focused on music, podcasts and TV.Apple updates MacBook Air and Pro and drops priceAs it got rid of the MacBook, Apple also killed off the old version of the MacBook Air, which had been on sale for years and remained a cheap way of getting an Apple computer but had a variety of old components.Apple appears to now see the MacBook Air as the entry-level computer that will replace the thin and small MacBook. As it announced the death of the MacBook model, it reduced the price of the Air to $1,099, apparently to ensure its place as the cheapest of Apple\u0027s computers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate.

It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesArchaeologists now believe that, in order to construct the complex, early Bronze Age Greeks embarked on at least 3,500 maritime voyages to transport between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes of shining white marble from one Aegean island to another. Each return voyage would have required up to 24 crew members to paddle for around five hours.It is by far the largest prehistoric marine transport operation that has ever come to light anywhere in the world, said Dr Julian Whitewright, a leading maritime archaeologist at the University of Southampton.It demonstrates quite clearly just how important, and integral to their culture, seafaring was to these early Bronze Age Aegean people.The voyages – totalling around 45,000 miles – allowed the architects to construct what is thought to have been a huge religious sanctuary consisting of up to 60 marble buildings which were constructed specifically to glisten in the sun.Dhaskalio, off the Cycladic island of Keros (Cambridge Keros Project)What\u0027s more, the architects \u0027terra-formed\u0027 the pyramid-shaped island \u0027mini-mountain\u0027, known in recent centuries as Dhaskalio (possibly just meaning \u0027islet\u0027), to create around a thousand metres of artificial terracing, arranged in six \u0027steps\u0027 on its steep slopes.These roughly six metre wide terraces appear to have been built specifically to accommodate all the buildings. The summit itself was not initially built on – but instead had a small probably sacred open area where votive offerings may have been deposited.Our investigation has been transforming our understanding of early Bronze Age Cycladic culture and suggests that these very early Greeks were organisationally, technically and politically much more advanced than previously thought, said the project\u0027s co-director, Michael Boyd of Cambridge University\u0027s McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.Nothing like this monumental complex has ever been found from this period in or around Greece before.Rise and fall of ancient civilisations revealed by Arctic pollutionAlthough the current archaeological investigations on Dhaskalio have been going on for the past four years, its only more detailed examination of the resultant data over the past 12 months that has revealed the true scale of the complex and the transport logistics and construction work associated with it.But the remarkable nature of the site does fit into a much more widely dispersed series of monumental construction traditions from western Europe and the Middle East.Intriguingly, it was built within 100 years or so of the creation of Stonehenge, the first Egyptian pyramids, the great cities of the Indus Valley and the first known Mesopotamian kingdoms.This broader context shows quite clearly that Dhaskalio was part of a much wider cultural and political phenomenon involving huge ultra-ambitious construction and political projects. These Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indus Valley and Western European traditions were almost certainly not directly related to each other – but were probably the result of a common stimulus, namely the spread and intensification of early metal usage, and the mercantile, cultural and political changes that process triggered.Equally significantly, Dhaskalio shows that, contrary to previous belief, Greece was part and parcel of that much wider phenomenon.While the inidual buildings on Dhaskalio were not themselves truly monumental, the complex as a whole certainly was.The 7,000-10,000 tonnes of white marble, needed for the project, were quarried in the south-east part of Naxos, a large island around 6.5 miles north-west of Dhaskalio. Each return trip from Naxos to Dhaskalio would therefore have been around 13 miles.Images of Aegean Cycladic boats survive – so it is known that they were each only 10-15 metres long and capable of carrying only between one\u0026nbspand two\u0026nbsptonnes of cargo.Site of ancient massacre yields the secrets of a lost Greek cityThe prehistoric Aegean project engineers then had to create the mountainside terraces to accommodate the dozens of white marble buildings - some of which were two-storey and up to 10 metres long. Because the entire complex was constructed according to a set plan with buildings of very similar design, it is thought that the entire island sanctuary was constructed over a relatively short period – probably between 20 and 40 years. Its existence – and the huge and consistent organisation of labour and transport that had to be deployed - strongly suggests that there was a strong and stable political entity involved, potentially based on Keros or possibly Naxos.From the south, the island would have been visible from many miles away as a gleaming white pyramid-shaped mini-mountain rising out of the sea.It is not known for sure whether the pyramidic shape was in any way significant. But the place had certainly been specifically selected as a religious site in preference to other much higher, more impressive and potentially more accessible mountains that did not have that shape. What\u0027s more, pyramidic shapes were, at precisely that time, coming to be regarded as sacred just 500 miles to the south-east in ancient Egypt (Indeed it is also at that time that there are the first signs of Egyptian influence on nearby Crete).Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe, Germany)In the ancient Egyptian context, pyramid shapes were associated with a god of creation, Atum. He was believed to inhabit a pyramid-shaped rock (a \u0027pyramidion\u0027 or \u0027Benben\u0027 stone) that was seen as symbolising the mythical \u0027primordial mound\u0027 (representing the first dry land) which (much as in the Biblical story of creation) rose out of a sea of chaos\u0026nbspat the time of creation. What\u0027s more, that pyramidic stone symbolised the sacred place where the first rays of the Sun illuminated the primordial mound at the time of creation - and the pyramidic shape of the pyramidion (the idealised primordial mound) was seen as symbolising the slanting rays of the sun as they descended from the sky to earth. Indeed, the ancient Egyptians used to cover their symbolic pyramidions\u0026nbspin gold leaf so that they would shine and glisten in the sun (potentially for the same or similar reasons that the Dhaskalio architects went to so much trouble to ensure that their pyramid-shaped island sanctuary would also glisten in the rays of the Sun).The Mesopotamians and others had similar \u0027primordial mound rising out of watery chaos\u0027 creation myths – and it is conceivable that Dhaskalio rising out of the sea symbolises some Cycladic version of those wider sacred cosmological concepts.Archaeologists discover long-lost tools used to build StonehengeArchaeologists discover eight ancient mummies in EgyptArchaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeIn the early Greek world, it is conceivable that the concept of the sacred mountain was exported from Dhaskalio to Crete and perhaps ultimately from there to mainland Greece.Certainly the main concentration of sacred (sometimes distinctly pyramid-shaped) mountains in Crete are in an area directly associated with what appears to have been Early Bronze Age colonisers from the Cycladic islands.Those Cretan sacred mountains and mountaintop religious sanctuaries appear to precede the eventual emergence on the Greek mainland of Mount Olympus as the principal home of the gods of ancient Greece.In religious and probably political terms, Dhaskalio seems to have had an unexpectedly important role in the early cultural development of the Greek world.It is potentially a fundamental place of origin for the phenomenon of sacred mountains within the Greek world, said the world\u0027s leading expert on Greek mountaintop sanctuaries, Dr Alan Peatfield of University College Dublin\u0027s School of Archaeology.The archaeological investigations on the islet are being carried out with the support of the Greek Ministry of Culture by archaeologists from Britain, Greece, Germany, France, Australia, the US, and half a dozen other countries. They are being funded by the US-based Institute for Aegean Prehistory, the Cyprus-based AG Leventis Foundation and the Athens-based the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. Major support is also being provided by the British-Academy-funded British School at Athens and the internationally-funded Cyprus Institute. The excavations and analysis of the finds are being directed by British archaeologists, Professor Colin Renfrew and Michael Boyd, both of Cambridge University\u0027s McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.The finds from Dhaskalio are currently being investigated in great detail.Of particular interest are 1500 imported stone disks (each between eight and 50 centimetres in diameter) – and 700 imported white pebbles. The latter objects appear to have been used as religious offerings, presumably for the spirit or deity associated with the island mini-mountain.The discs came from various different Cycladic islands, while the pebbles were imported solely from the neighbouring island of Upper Koufonisi, three miles north-west of Dhaskalio.Very significantly, this practice of using stone discs and depositing pebbles seems to have ultimately been exported to Crete by Cycladic colonisers for use on Cretan sacred mountain sites.ScanPyramids project shows methods used to \u0027see-through\u0027 the Great PyramidThe archaeologists are also examining 36 small complete marble statues, unearthed on Dhaskalio - as well as evidence that very substantial numbers of copper daggers, spearheads, axes and other tools were manufactured on the sacred islet (conceivably as magical talismans for pilgrims to take home with them).What\u0027s more, just 100 metres away from the sacred islet, on the extreme western end of the island of Keros, early Bronze Age pilgrims deposited more than a thousand ritually broken religious marble figurines (mainly depicting women in symbolic form), again brought there from all over the Cycladic Archipelago. Also ritually deposited there were literally thousands of blades and other tools manufactured at or very near the deposition site, but made of obsidian (natural volcanic glass) mainly imported from the Cycladic island of Milos.Today Dhaskalio is a small island – but back in the Early Bronze Age, it was linked to that deposition site on Keros by a natural sandbank causeway. Perhaps Dhaskalio was considered so sacred that ordinary pilgrims could not even set foot on it – and had to leave their offerings near the Keros end of the causeway, presumably for the sacred islet\u0027s spirit or deity to duly collect.Only further research will help determine Dhaskalio\u0027s precise role in the early history of Greece and what it symbolised.But whether the pyramid-shaped islet was simply a spectacular religious sanctuary or whether it also potentially symbolised the emergence of the first land out of the waters of chaos at Creation may never be known.• Although both Dhaskalio and Keros are strictly closed to visitors, the world\u0027s first ever exhibition on the recent archaeological finds from the ancient islet sanctuary will be held from 14 July to September 30 on the nearby island of Upper Koufonisi.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The contract fell through after the Irish company that Seaborne was relying on to carry out the shipping pulled out In 2015, then Justice Secretary Grayling introduced a policy whereby convicted criminals would have to pay from £150-£1200 towards the cost of their case. The policy was criticised for compelling defendants to plead guilty and led to protests by magistrates. The policy was scrapped by Michael Gove when he became Justice Secretary later that year88 Cyclists not road usersAs Transport Secretary, Grayling once failed to recognise cyclists as road usersEurotunnel, which has experience in running ferries as well as the shuttle between Folkestone and Calais, was not invited to tender.The committee\u0026nbspsays the hurried and bungled arrangements exposed the department to a court challenge from Eurotunnel.“Rather than risk losing a legal case, which may have resulted in the court cancelling the ferry contracts ahead of 29 March 2019, the department reached a £33 million out-of-court settlement with Eurotunnel,” the report said.In addition, £51.4m of taxpayers’ money was spent on cancelling contracts with the Danish ferry operator DFDS and the French line Brittany Ferries.The DfT claimed that the £33m settlement with Eurotunnel would go towards infrastructure improvements. But Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “Public benefits from the settlement with Eurotunnel amount to little more than window dressing.“The taxpayer has been landed with a £85m bill with very little to show for it following the rushed procurement of ferry freight capacity.”Travel after Brexit: All you need to know about Eurostar and ferriesGovernment forced to pay Eurotunnel £33m over no-deal ferry farceEurotunnel, Russel Hobbs, Facebook: Business news in brief, Thursday 2Eurotunnel make €29m claim on taxpayers over refugee crisis The MPs also warned the DfT about a lack of preparedness for the next deadline for leaving the European Union, 31 October 2019.The committee said: “The department must learn from this episode and use its time well should it be required to re-procure ferry capacity ahead of the new October deadline.“The window for decision-making for any departure on 31 October is short and key deadlines for decisions are passing every day.“There is a real risk that the short time left before 31 October will force the department into further high-risk procurements.A DfT spokesperson said: “The freight capacity contracts were taken out as an insurance policy for the UK to ensure that key medical supplies could be guaranteed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“This step was in response to changed assumptions about potential delays in the Dover strait, and the agreements were entered into as soon as a cross-government collective decision was taken that they were needed.“Two weeks ago the department outlined a new framework proposal to provide a list of operators capable of delivering this vital freight capacity without the government committing to any agreements at this stage, with market engagement already under way.”The DfT is facing more legal action relating to the Eurotunnel settlement.

Crucially, Labour would campaign for Remain in such a referendum.However, Jeremy Corbyn is keeping his options open about the party’s position at a general election – a\u0026nbspgrowing prospect, as\u0026nbspBoris Johnson, the clear frontrunner in the Tory leadership race, might seek an election if the Commons blocks no deal, while MPs could force an election to stop a\u0026nbspcrash-out.Labour pro-Europeans believe that it would now be inconceivable for the party to fight an election without supporting\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsp“two Rs” – referendum and Remain. But Mr Corbyn has not gone that far. Labour’s manifesto will be decided when an election is called, leaving open the possibility that a Labour government could seek its own Brexit deal, based on a customs union.If that were put to a confirmatory referendum, many Labour figures would have a dilemma. It would be virtually impossible for the leadership to campaign against its own agreement, but Mr Corbyn might permit his ministers and MPs\u0026nbspto campaign either for the deal or Remain. He has been reading up on how Harold Wilson, the then Labour prime minister, allowed such freedom\u0026nbspin the 1975\u0026nbsp Europe referendum.\u0026nbspCorbyn tells next PM to call new Brexit referendumFor now, Mr Corbyn is still trying to appeal to Remainers and Leavers, and can’t keep everyone happy. His support for a referendum and a Remain vote on any Tory deal has angered pro-Brexit Labour MPs representing Leave areas in the north and midlands, who\u0026nbspwarn it will cost the party the next election.\u0026nbsp But keeping alive a Labour deal does not go far enough for some Labour Remainers, and\u0026nbspallows the Liberal Democrats and Greens to argue that Labour is still pro-Brexit.\u0026nbspThere could be pressure on Mr Corbyn to come out unequivocally for Remain at Labour’s annual conference in September. Without that, Labour might still struggle to explain its complex policy on the doorsteps.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s new stance makes it slightly more likely that there could be a Commons majority for a Final Say referendum. In\u0026nbspa Commons vote in April, 203 Labour MPs supported a people’s vote and 24 opposed it, while 20 abstained, some of whom might now back the move if the new prime minister put a revised deal to MPs.\u0026nbspIn April, a referendum was defeated by 12 votes.\u0026nbspOnly 14 Tory MPs supported the proposal, so more would probably be needed to forge a majority. That could happen if a Final Say vote became a mechanism to stop no deal. But time would be very short. A government actively pursuing no deal could ignore a non-binding Commons vote for a referendum, and refuse to bring in the necessary legislation. So opponents of a crash-out may have to find other ways of preventing one.Labour’s shift towards Remain might just increase the temptation for\u0026nbspPM Johnson\u0026nbspto seek a mandate for no deal at an election, as he eyed up marginal seats in the north and midlands. Then Mr Corbyn could no longer put off his final decision on whether Labour should become a Remain party.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have already agreed to field only one candidate in next month’s Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, and Unite for Remain is designed to encourage a similar approach across the country.Ms Allen will chair the group’s advisory council, which will consist of the party\u0026nbspleaders and senior figures from\u0026nbspthe Remain parties. Insiders said it\u0026nbspwas important that the initiative was led by an independent MP who did not have an agenda in favour of any particular party.Unite for Remain\u0026nbspis aiming to form an alliance in between 150 and 180 seats across the country, although the unwillingness of the SNP to take part means it is unlikely to focus its efforts on Scottish constituencies.Donors have also been lined up to help support candidates who stand under the Unite to Remain banner.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Allen said voters were “crying out” for parties to work together, and that the “high likelihood” of a general election required “urgent” action to boost the number of Remain-supporting MPs. \u0026nbspShe said: “Brexit has shifted the tectonic plates and shifted politics and our way of operating more than anything before. With both Labour and the Tories moving to the extremes, people just don’t recognise politics any more.“The only way we’re going to break out of that under first-past-the-post is to learn to work differently. I’m genuinely encouraged by the appetite in all the parties to try. We might not succeed and get as many seats as we’d like but we need to try to build a genuine centre-ground, internationalist movement.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyInsisting that there was significant support for a new alliance, she added: “The risk of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage twinkling over the horizon has really focused people’s minds. It is unprecedented. People in party politics don’t typically behave like this but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the appetite.”Ms Allen said Unite for Remain would prioritise \u0026nbsp“modern, country-first, cross-party collaboration across the nation” and added: \u0026nbsp“Our country is crying out for mature and progressive politics, not a government elected to pursue old ideology from the left or right. We need to work together to increase the number of MPs who can bring this aspiration to life.”Insiders said the group was\u0026nbspformed partly in anticipation of the number of independent MPs\u0026nbspincreasing\u0026nbspif there are further defections from the Conservatives once\u0026nbspBoris Johnson becomes leader and from Labour if the party pushes ahead with deselections.Pro-EU parties announced last week that they would all be supporting the Liberal Democrat candidate, Jane Dodds, in Brecon and Radnorshire.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The tanker was nabbed just as Iran and world powers were preparing to begin two months of talks that could stop Tehran from further escalating its nuclear programme.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany issued a statement voicing “deep concern” that Iran has upped its uranium enrichment levels from 3.67 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and called for the formation of\u0026nbsp a “joint commission”, as prescribed by the JCPOA,\u0026nbspto address the disputes.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tensions high as Trump approves new Iran sanctions: In pictures Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iran claims that in this picture released by Iran state TV, their surface-to-air missile is seen as it shoots down a US surveillance droneThis photo shows US RQ-4A Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone.

The pictures suggests that the ship is \u0027likely\u0027 to have been hit by a mine as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo moves to blame Iran for the suspected attackFrench president Emmanuel Macron’s top diplomatic advisor, Emmanuel Bonne, was scheduled to arrive in Tehran on Tuesday to meet with Iranian leaders, a task that could be complicated by the ill will generated by the tanker seizure.\u0026nbsp“Release the tanker before negotiating with p4+1,” the hardline Vatan-e Emruz newspaper demanded in a front-page headline alongside a photo of the tanker, referring to the four permanent members of the UN security council and Germany.\u0026nbspGibraltar authorities said in a press statement issued on Monday that the tanker was loaded with crude oil when it was captured in its territorial waters “during a pre-arranged call for provisions and spare parts” as part of European Union sanctions on prohibitions of exporting crude oil to Syria.\u0026nbspThe seizure of the ship creates tangled legal issues that crisscross maritime and sanctions law. It also shows how western policy goals can contradict each other when it comes to Iran.\u0026nbsp“Certainly this latest move by the Brits comes during very poor timing in terms of the European outreach with Iran to reverse its non-compliance actions,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, Iran specialist at the European Council on foreign relations.Hardline Iranian newspaper demands: “Freedom of the oil tanker before negotiations with P4+1” (Vatan-e-Emrouz)Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, insisted on Sunday that the ship was not headed to the Syrian port of Baniyas, which is the location of a\u0026nbsprefinery. “The port that they have named in Syria essentially does not have the capacity for such a supertanker,” he said. “The target was somewhere else.”\u0026nbspBut he did not specify its destination, saying only that it was passing through international waters and “there is no law that allows England to stop this tanker”.Some experts question whether the EU has the right to apply its sanctions on non-members. Gibraltar authorities say they have received a court order to hold on to the vessel until at least 19 July. The UK, and its overseas territory Gibraltar, will cease to be members of the EU after Brexit.\u0026nbspUK in diplomatic maelstrom with Iran and Spain amid oil-tanker seizureIran has been frustrated by its inability to sell oil internationally. The US has warned that it would punish any firm or nation that purchased Iranian energy products, the lifeblood of its economy.\u0026nbspIndependent experts believe Iran was behind attacks on half-a-dozen oil tankers transiting from the Arabian Peninsula in response to the US blockade. And Iranian officials have now warned the UK they will\u0026nbsprespond to the seizure of\u0026nbspGrace 1.\u0026nbsp“This action will not go unanswered and, if need be, at an appropriate time and place, a response to this miserable action will be considered,” Maj Gen Mohammad Hossein Baqeri, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, was quoted as saying on Tuesday by the Fars news agency.\u0026nbspAnalysts warn that the longer the tanker issue plays out, the more dangerous it will become.“The longer the situation continues, the more thinking will be done in Tehran about the range of possible responses,” said Ms Geranmayeh.“Whether that’s a diplomatic push, a legal challenge, or as the military in Iran have suggested, something more radical, and a reciprocal response in terms of freedom of navigation.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s in really bad shape with paint peeling off the walls and is quite ugly.Before she can launch into the project and turn these crumbling ruins into the holiday home of her dreams, there is one big sticking point: Italy’s hellish red tape.Property boundary maps dont exist here - and she will need a translator to sign the purchase deed as she’s a foreigner.Im still going through all the paperwork hassle but hopefully it’ll be done by the end of July,” she says.Over  € dwellings have so far been sold in Mussomeli, mainly to European and Americans, while another  are potentially available.The most successful town in the scheme so far has been Gangi in Sicily where the mayor has sold over  abandoned homes, mainly to foreign buyers, some as far away as China.Kathleen Sparks, a  year-old publisher and her husband Garreth Powis, a finance manager, applied for a € house online in Mussomeli earlier this year and were subsequently contacted by the production company to take part in the show.“We had just applied for a € house online when the TV people came knocking at our door in London as the mayor had forwarded our contacts,” explains Kathleen.“They asked us why we wanted to do this and we told them: that we wanted a second holiday home in Italy which we could rent when we were in London. They showed us pictures of available properties, small ones, big ones, all more or less crumbling down, even before we flew over to Sicily.”The couple have only just ed from a visit to the town where they were given a tour by the local authorities and shown all the available houses and eventually picked one they liked.“So far we’ve paid just € for a -storey building and hope to buy the one next door to enlarge it, but that would have a higher price and there are issues with our paperwork,” explains Kathleen.“Apparently the property map is missing but the mayor told me all will be soon ready for when wethis summer and the TV will be there to film us entering our new home and meeting with the architect and builders for the renovation.”The couple hopes that starring in the TV show will give “good exposure” to their new holiday rental and get holidaymakers flocking.Guess we will need to tune in to the new show to seetheir holiday rental flies or flops...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, really.Christine Lagarde, replacing Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, was a proud cheerleader for Project Fear in her role as head of the International Monetary Fund, predicting the UK’s collapsewe dared vote for Brexit.And Charles Michel, the lame duck Belgium Prime Minister replacing Donald Tusk as EU Council President, has consistently dismissed Brexit as a contemptible little “soap opera”.Come back, Jean-Claude Drunker — all is forgiven!I have seen these appointments described as a “huge headache” for the next British Prime Minister.On the contrary, having an elite of Brexit-bashing, Brit-loathing Eurocrats spitting their federalist poison at us makes leaving the EU inevitable.Nothing is more likely to finally get us out of the European Union than having a sneering, bossy rabble of democracy-denying nonentities wagging their fingers in our faces.I wouldn’t trust the EU Ayatollahs to run a whelk stall.Charles Michel’s major claim to fame is that he became Belgium’s youngest ever PM in , despite his party coming third in the elections.Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence in  over a financial scandal in France but spared jail time and allowed to keep her job.She is the first female head of the European Central Bank and also the first who has no background in economics.Despite her eight years as head of the IMF, Lagarde is a lawyer and a politician. So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band. He chose the members. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs.”But then Brian let Mick and Keith do the heavy lting, writing songs while he dozed comatose on the studio floor.So Mick and Keith gave him £, and slung him out. And Brian died in his swimming pool at the age of .Jones practically invented sex and drugs and rock and roll.And half-a-century on, nobody embodies the danger and dark glamour of that philosophy quite like Brian Jones.“Grace expected a bigger role,” reports a source. “She was out of there quicker than it takes to rustle up a Martini.”Weird.Don’t actors usually have a quick look at the screenplay before they turn up on set Evenit’s just to learn their lines.DON’T you love the Duchess of Cambridge Kate rocked up at Wimbledon this week watching the action out on Court  – which has a capacity of just .Kate, above, saw British wildcard entry Harriet Dart, ranked number  in the world, get her first win at Wimbledon.Meanwhile Meghan watched Serena Williams on Court One.I can’t imagine any Royal apart from Kate watching action on the tournament’s outside courts.WELL, there goes the Oasis reunion.I can’t see any reconciliation after the latest spat. Noel’s we Sara called Liam a “fat t**t”.Then Liam instructed Noel and Sara’s daughter to tell her “stepmam” to “be very careful”.Then Noel – the most reasonable, rational Gallagher – was understandably mfed, asking his brotherhe was planning on “grabbing my we by the throat to show her who’s boss” – a dig at Liam’s unpleasant domestic with his girlfriend Debbie.The Gallaghers should do all this behind closed doors rather than on the public space of social media.For years their family spats were entertaining. Now they are just nasty, embarrassing and ugly.BREXIT Party MEPs were accused of acting like English football hooligans at the opening of the European Parliament when they turned their backs at, “Ode To Joy”, the EU anthem.I smiled – I confess – but carrying themselves with quiet dignity would have served their cause better.Meanwhile, Lib Dem MEPs took selfies of themselves proudly wearing T-shirts that bore the legend “Bollocks to Brexit”.That’s the great thing about the European Parliament.Whatever your views, there will always be someone willing to act like an attention-seeking idiot on your behalf.UNTIL this week, the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had been overwhelmingly peaceful.Then on the nd anniversary of the handover to China, protestors kicked in the windows of Hong Kong’s parliament, the Legislative Council – known as LegCo.Once inside they flew the Union Jack and Hong Kong’s colonial flag and generally vandalised the place.Nothing is more likely to provoke a Communist backlash.But why were the police waiting so patiently outside  And were those men flying the Union Jack really pro-democracy students It stank of a set-up.“Conspiracy theories abound,” I am told by someone in Hong Kong.“But the overwhelming likelihood is that storming LegCo was an unforced error by the students that has cost them the high moral ground.”Shame.Those millions of peaceful, freedom-loving kids were doing so well.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon declined to curtsy when meeting the Queen.Snubbing a -year-old woman!Well played, wee Nicola.I bet you felt just like Braveheart.FOR the first time in ten years, sales of TV licences have fallen – down , to ,, – as more viewers ditch the BBC for Netflix, other streaming services and the infinite joys of the internet.The BBC has been horribly served by its current bosses.They have turned a beloved national treasure into a bloated, widely despised, cash-happy monolith.Handing out an extra £million to its laughably overpaid “stars” – most of them shockingly ordinary talking heads – while at the same time ditching the free licence for over-s was terminally, suicidally dumb.History will show this was the beginning of the end for the compulsory licence fee.AFTER a leak by civil servants claiming that Jeremy Corbyn is far too frail in body and mind to be Prime Minister, Jezza has made it his business to look all hale and hearty.As Labour chiefs furiously demanded an inquiry into the leak, Jezza, , was photographed manfully riding his bike through the sunny streets of Islington.He looked like Albert Steptoe impersonating Lance Armstrong.I do wish the civil servants would retract these nasty rumours about Corbyn’s frail health.Because I don’t think I can stand one more sighting of Jezza’s scrawny chicken legs.“That’s cute,” sneers Lammy, “considering the only battle he’s ever been in is with a strawberry milkshake.”Unlike Lammy, who must go to war every day trying to do up the top button of his trousers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But too often, especially as the memory of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fades, they have been shunted down the policy pecking order.Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction. But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to armed forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases. They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.EVERY time you think they can’t sink any lower, Labour’s leadership finds a way.This once great party is now run by a rabble of apologists for anti-Semitism, Marxists and bullies.They think nothing of spending their members’ cash on expensive law firms in an attempt to throttle the free press.And when it comes to policy, their combination of two-faced doublespeak on Brexit and a cripplingly expensive nationalisation programme would send the UK economy into a nosee it might never recover from.Yet still there are decent MPs on those Labour backbenches who think the tide will turn, that evenCorbyn was to enter Downing Street he could somehow be managed. Codswallop.It’s put up or shut up time for them.BOTH Tory candidates to be next PM have promised to deliver Brexit, deal or no deal.It’s the only hope the party has of remaining relevant.So when they take office, they have a mandate to deliver their promises in the leadership contest. Including those on the European Union.That means those Tory MPs who are still dead-set on crippling the Government’s Exit strategy by stopping a clean break are not just turning their noses up at their own members.They’re risking the future of the party.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not a regular port of call because I’m a Good Morning Britain devotee thanks, in no small part, to the Great Sussex Doughnut hole, Piers Morgan, who took one look at its saccharine sweet format, back in , and thought: “Sod that for roasting politicians and a few home truths.”His tabloid instincts didn’t let him down. Its predecessor GMTV used to be such an easy ride Gordon Brown actually offered its host Fiona Phillips a Government job.These days, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and PM-in-waiting Boris Johnson are both too spineless to go anywhere near the GMB studio.BBC pay was the big story last week, though, so I had to desert ship for Breakfast, where I immediately discovered no one’s paid quite enough to work a five-day week and a squad rotation system is at play.Thursday and Friday it was the horribly mismatched Charlie “errr” Stayt and Naga Munchetty, who are both on £, but have so little on-screen chemistry they make Piers’ and Susanna’s squabbling sound more like Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin — Je t’aime . . . moi non plus, Chunk.Star pairing, however, are the undoubtedly talented and likeable Dan Walkerand Louise Minchinwho can actually bear to look at her co-host and almost won me over with Wednesday’s first link of the day. “Day three of Wimbledon and Carolisn’t looking quite so lovely.”No. And you should see her at the end of the fortnight, Louise.It’s not the clumsiness or the lack of chemistry, though, that make Breakfast feel like you’re stuck with Saturday Superstore when Tiswas is on the other side. It’s the content, which is a marathon BBC right-on whinge.So you seem to get a “gender equality row” , followed by environmental armageddon and an “NHS funding crisis”, every day.Three hours of that and, I promise, you’ll feel like you’ve been embalmed by pulped copies of .Ironically, the show also doesn’t seem to like anyone with a large salary and, on Wednesday, Tesco’s Dave Lewis was being asked by Steph McGovernhe was: “comfortable getting paid what you do”.The brass neck it took to include that segment is quite something when you consider it had absolutely nothing to say about its own scandalously huge wage bill on Wednesday.They even tried to gloss over it during the paper review when the story flashed up on the front page of every newspaper, although Dan Walker did admit: “Lots of people contacting us on that. We always appreciate your feedback.”I hope, then, that Dan Walker appreciates me saying his show’s hypocrisy is every bit as nauseating as the BBC’s excess, ’cos no autocue reader should be paid anything more than £, when pensioners are having to pay for their licence.AndBBC staffers don’t like that figure  Well, they’re free to offer their talents to the private sector and I’ll be sure to tip Naga Munchetty heavily when she arrives with my Deliveroo order, as I really liked the pointed question she posed about a nuisance barnyard animal, on Friday’s paper review.“Is anyone interested in a noisy cock ”To my own surprise and horror, I am. Every Monday to Wednesday at am, on ITV.BBC Breakfast, Wednesday, Louise Minchin: “The Daily Mirror concentrates on England’s World Cup defeat.” .Good Morning Britain, Peter Andre: “I’ve been up to lots of things, I don’t want to bore you with the details, but . . . ”And Love Island, Amy to Curtis: “I would like some constructive feedback from you on things I could do dferently.”About as much she’d like a Bic razor and can of deodorant for Christmas, she would.JEEZ, you think the Love Island contestants are thick, trying to work outBarcelona’s in Spain or Italy.Then Love Island viewers stick their oar in and, suddenly, Jourdan and Belle look like intellectual giants by comparison. Not all the viewers, obviously.Just those few hundred who’ve got Ofcom on speed-dial and are forever accusing someone of “gaslighting” or claiming someone  needs to be removed “for their own safety”.Clearly no one’s explained to these cretins it’s an ITV dating show, not Channel ’s Dispatches, and objecting to jealousy or lust not only misses the show’s entire point, it threatens to ruin the meagre pleasures of watching Love Island.For me, last week, that mainly involved trying to catch a single glimpse of George the builder, a blond Essex vacuum, who’d been looking like the sparest part inLove Island history, until “partner” Lucie and Maura pulled him and Marvin aside for a Sunday night chat. Can he fix it Maura: “I’ve tried, she’s tried. There’s no point in prolonging this bulls**t. That’s it.”No he can’t.Top Gear jumping on the rainbow flag-waving bandwagon with the emptiest Pride gesture of all time.People who say “challenging behaviour” when they mean “disruptive little turd”.Snowflake Love Island fans complaining about absolutely everything.Loose Woman Janet Street-Porter constantly name-dropping all her famous friends .And the Norwich City fan, on Channel ’s Drag SOS, who thought the way to stand out from the Carrow Road crowd was wearing a tutu and wig, when ten fingers and two eyes really would’ve done it.EASTENDERS had a real opportunity recently.Louise Mitchell was locked in a shipping container, bound for Odessa, in the Ukraine, with plenty of space for the rest of the deadwood, Denise, Hunter, Kim, Denny, Bobby, Honey, Sonia, Bernie, Robbie and Adam, who could all have been as quickly for- gotten as Ben Mitchell’s forgotten he’s deaf.Instead, some imbecile left a mobile phone inside the container, she escaped and the moment was gone for ever.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was never told not to wear contact lenses in the shower, there’s no warning on the packaging and my opticians never mentioned a risk.”Nick only realised something was wrong in January , when he noticed a scratch on his right eye.He assumed that hed scratched his eye while putting lenses in but as the week went on, it became obvious that something more serious had happened.“For a few days I used over the counter eye drops and turned all my phone and computer display settings down to the lowest brightness, which seemed to do the trick,” he explained.Eventually, Nick went to see an optician who told him that he had an ulcer on his eye and who recommended he go to hospital immediately.“The doctors said they couldn’t be sure what was happening until they had the test results back, but that they thought it might be Acanthamoeba keratitis ,” he said.Thats an infection of the cornea, caused by a tiny organism called Acanthamoeba, which is found in water.“I’d never heard of the infection before, but as soon as I got home I turned to Dr Google and was suddenly left thinking I was going to have my right eyeball removed,” he said.A week later, docs told Nick that he had tested positive for the infection, which led him to fear hed need to have his eye removed.Nick used disinfectant eye drops for three weeks which seemed to be working.But by March , he suddenly found himself completely blind in his right eye.“I was driving to work and my vision completely went in my right eye,” he recalled. “I don’t know how I managed not to crash, but it didn’t take me long to realise I needed to get back to the hospital.”He found himself housebound and depressed while docs tried to work out the best course of action.“I love my job but I physically couldn’t be outside the house,” he said.“The pain in my eye was too much and the only time I would leave was to visit the hospital.“I felt at my absolute lowest and the one thing that would cheer me up – playing football – was no longer an option.”Six months after his inital diagnosis, docs decided that the only option was to perform something called a corneal cross linking.It involves using ultraviolet light and vitamin B drops to stfen the cornea.While the procedure – performed in July last year – cleared the infection, Nick remained blind in his right eye.He said: “Obviously, I didn’t want to be blind in my right eye, but at least, knowing the infection had gone, I could start to get my le back on track. I could finallyto work and start to hit the gym.”In September, Nick had an amniotic membrane transplant to his right cornea at the Birmingham and West Midland Eye Centre, which was a success.Nicks mental health has suffered as a result of his trauma.“The reality of the situation had well and truly hit me, I’d let myself go since all of this happened and I was left with a gory-looking eye I had to cover with an eye patch – looking like something out of The Exorcist,” he said.After being referred to a counsellor by the GP, Nick has slowly come to terms with his condition.Hes now working with the charity Fight for Sight, to raise awareness of the danger of using contact lenses in the shower or while swimming.He said: “I can honestly sayI’d had the slightest idea that this was even a remote possibility I would never have worn contacts in the first place. It’s crucial that people out there know this is a reality and it can happen because of something as simple as getting in the shower.He said: “I’ve lost  months of my le because of something as simple as showering with contacts in. If I get my sight back I’ll never wear contacts again.Instead, like Edgar Davids – the former Dutch professional footballer – I’ll wear some prescription goggles to do sport instead.”According to a poll by YouGov for the sight charity,  per cent of contact lense wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended  hours a day, with  per cent saying theyd swum or showered in them. per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and  per cent said theyd put their contacts in their mouth to clean or lubricate them."},{"url":null,"title":"horror toddler arm stuck escalator","story":"Shocking CCTV footage shows the two-year-old and his mum riding down an escalator when the child suddenly appears to be on his back while crying in pain.The video then shows the toddlers mum immediately bend over to try to pick him up, but the escalator kept moving at a steady pace making it dficult for the boy to be set free.With just seconds to go a security guard managed to hit the stop button, saving the youngsters arm during the terrying ordeal at the City Star shopping complex.The security guard weaved through the crowd as he rushed to press the button during the incident on July , preventing what could have resulted in severe injuries by just one second.But the toddler remained with his right arm trapped in the gap between the escalator steps for a further  minutes until the fire service could free him.Rescue footage shows firefighters doing their best to comfort the boy as they find a way to free his arm.His shocked mum can be seen watching helplessly from the other side of the glass handrail as rescuers try to slowly free his arm without causing further injury.Fireman Liu Cheng said: By the time we arrived, his family was basically too stricken with panic to convey any effective information regarding how the accident happened.The boy himself wouldnt stop crying.

But Sommarøy — or Summer Island — about an hour’s drive from the city of Tromsø and with a population of just , has also found itself at the centre of controversy.A press release put out by Norway’s state-funded enterprise agency Innovation Norway about their plans prompted a backlash, with some accusing them of spreading “fake news”.Calls have been made for Innovation Norway’s director to quit, with claims the “misguided publicity stunt” cost Norwegian taxpayers more than £,.Kjell, a sixth-generation is- lander, appeared shaken by the media storm.The -year-old dad of three said he travelled to Oslo with local MP Kent Gudmundsen to hand over the petition, and the photos were not staged.He said: “It’s never been my intention to do something fake. We know it’s true.”He views the bid as merely underlining what the islanders do already, and added: “The goal is to get the time-free zone formalised.“Is it likely to be approved  I doubt it, but it’s worth a try.”Over a coffee in front of breathtaking views, Kjell said he came up with the idea after deciding to quit his job in the island’s only hotel last year.He added: “People asked meI was ill but I said no, I just decided to take my time back.“Many people are getting over- whelmed with time pressure, and how they don’t take the time to actually live their lives.“My family can tell you how hard I was working but my passion has now become helping others to have a better le.”Kjell has not owned a watch for five years. If he needs to know the time he just looks at where the sun is in the sky.Earlier, as we drove over the bridge to the island, I noticed the abandoned watches. So in order to truly live like a local, we pulled over and I attached mine to the railings too.Due to the Earth’s tilt on its axis, and in contrast to the summer months, Sommarøy is cloaked in continuous darkness for a large part of winter, so it is no surprise that locals take full advantage of   daylight.No one uses fixed times and when making plans, islanders will always say: “See you later.”Immersing myself in island le, I headed out at .pm for a bike ride in bright sunshine, stopping to make a sandcastle on the beach around .pm.Then it was on to the Nord Sommarøy Outdoor Centre, whose midnight sun kayaking tours are hugely popular.By then I was told it was am, but after a quick change we hiked up a mountain.At am we reached the top, from where we could see Sommarøy bathed in a glorious golden glow. Below, we spotted a group of teenagers tearing around the island on bikes.I was reminded of something Kjell told me earlier, that in summer, children don’t have a bedtime here. At night, Sommarøy becomes their playground.Earlier, islander Hal Ludvigsen told me: “We get  days of sunshine but we pay for it with no sun in winter.“When the sun is back, we know the value. People say, ‘How do you know when to eat and when to go to bed ’ Well, we eat when we’re hungry and go to bed when we’re tired.”In winter Hal, , hosts Northern Lights tours and earns enough to see him through summer. His favourite place to see the midnight sun is the Hekkingen Lighthouse.For the boat ride over, we were joined by his girlfriend Lena Olsson, who is Swedish but moved to Sommarøy two years ago after falling in love with Hal — and the island.She said: “It gets you in the heart when you see it. Sweden is a beautul country but this is paradise. It’s very special here. There is no stress.”As -year-old Lena unpacked a picnic, Hal said: “We always come here at midnight. It’s perfect. The sun is beautul, like gold on the sea.”Back on land, at the island’s hotel, I finally managed to get some shut-eye, sleeping from .am to am — and was glad my room had blackout blinds.I put on an eye mask as well, just in case any light got through. I may have given up my watch, but I wasn’t going to give up sleeping too.Sommarøy’s ferry boat captain, Ketil Voll, hasn’t even surrendered his watch yet — though he does agree with making the island timeless.The -year-old said: “This was a good thing so people can think about how they spend their time. It’s made me realise I should work less and spend more time with my family.And while there have been claims that the move would be bad for tourism, there is no denying it has put Sommarøy firmly on the map.With a wry chuckle, Hal said: “People from Sommarøy used to say they were from an island near Tromsø — but now people in Tromsø are saying they live near Sommarøy.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub.

Sleep nakedIn the summer, it can be hard to regulate how hot our bedrooms become but other times, its a case of turning off your radiator, throwing open a window and donning your birthday suit.According to the National Sleep Foundation, the quicker you fall asleep, the better quality of sleep you tend to have. One way of reducing the amount of time it takes you to fall into a deep sleep is to lower your body temperature.Falling temperatures in the body tell it that its time for snoozing and a simple way to do that is to take off your clothes.Reducing body temperature not only helps you get off to sleep faster but may also improve the overall quality of your sleep.Although your body changes temperature throughout the night, going to sleep naked means that it doesnt have to cool down quite as vigorously and you can control the temperature more easily by removing or adding duvets and sheets.. Cold water bottleGrab your hot water bottle and fill it with icy slush.It might give you a bit of a shock in bed butyou are really struggling with overheating, its a good way of radiating out a cold hue in the sheets.. Freeze your sheetsSounds odd but putting your sheets in the freezer will make your bed beautully cool.Simply fold them into a waterproof bag and pop them in for  minutes before re-dressing your bed.. Have a flannelKeep a wet flannel by your bed and lie it over your eyes and press to your temples before you try to go to sleep.Apply it throughout the nightyou feel yourself coming over all hot and sweaty.. Use your blindsThe NHS recommends keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows.If this isnt possible, use light-coloured curtains and keep them closed , it explained.. Unplug technologyDid you know that plugged in chargers can emit heat It probably wont make a massive dference but youre better off moving any technology out of the bedroom and unplugging anything thats charging to reduce any extra heat.. Have a bathBefore you get into bed, have a cold shower or bath to take your body temperature down a bit.And once youre dry, get into bed in the nude.

Writing in the Mirror, Mr Corbyn says: “Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister, they should have the confidence to put their deal, or no-deal, back to the people in a public vote. “In those circumstances, Labour would campaign for Remain.”   Both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a no-deal Brexit and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump that runs down industry, opens up our NHS to more privatisation, and shreds standards on vital things like food safety and workers’ rights.”The Mirror last month revealed exclusively Mr Corbyn would back a second referendum.He was lobbied by allies John McDonnell and Diane Abbott to firm up the policy.And after weeks of internal pressure, he has confirmed the move. But he kept silent on what Labour’s Brexit position would be at the next election. Mr Corbyn said: “We have a democratic process, we will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign what our position will be.” Pressed on whether Labour was a party of Leave or Remain, he replied: “We will give people the choice on this.”    Some Labour Remainers warned that there must be no further clouding of the party’s position, after months of wrangling over Brexit. The lack of clarity was blamed for Labour’s disastrous showing at the EU elections, slipping to third behind the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems. Phil Wilson MP said: “If Labour falls back into silence on Brexit, then the anger felt about the plans to exclude the people from deciding on our future will turn too on our party.” But deputy leader Tom Watson, who has campaigned for a second vote, added: “Our members have been telling us for some time now they want us to be a Remain party, they want us to put the new deal to the people. “We are now going to campaign for that.”   Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer described the decision to back Remain as “a really important point of principle”. But Brexit-backing MP John Mann warned the move would hand a gt to Theresa May ’s successor. He said: “The one person who will be smiling at the announcement is Boris Johnson. I think it gives him a boost when he wins the Tory leadership.” Johnson and rival Jeremy Hunt have both said they would try to get a fresh deal with the EU, but would leave without onethey failed to do so.Mr Corbyn’s move came after unions this week backed Remain, but kept supporting a Leave vote on a Labour Brexit deal on the table. They urged the party to do the same andit came to winning a general election, said that deal should be put to a referendum.    The Brexit Party branded Mr Corbyn’s announcement a “tragedy for millions of traditional Labour voters”. A spokesman said: “With this decision Labour have made it clear they are the party of North Hampstead and no longer the party of North Shields.”Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake added: “Labour are still a party of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes the Labour Party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People’s Vote.“But it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit dealhe gets the keys to No .” In some Leave-supporting seats in Labour’s heartlands, its majority is so strong even its commitment to Remain should not harm its electoral chances. But in others, it would make slim advantages even more precarious. Labour Leave areas include Sunderland, Stoke and Hull.   Brexit Second Referendum QA What has been agreed  Labour wants the next Tory Prime Minister to stage a second referendum before taking the UK out of the EU either on a new deal negotiated by the incoming PM, or without an agreement with Brussels. Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to campaign for Remain at another vote in those circumstances, cheering the party’s pro-EU wing.  Does this change anything Labour had already pledged to campaign for a “public vote”, either a general election or a second referendum. But Mr Corbyn said the party would oppose a “Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs” - but that has always been Labour’s position. What is new is the insistence the party would fight to Remain in the EUa second referendum is held. The party leader was pushed towards adopting the stance after months of mounting pressure from Labour members, backbench MPs and, latterly, Shadow Cabinet loyalists.What happens at a general election Labour doesn’t know yet so it is unclear whether the party would go into a general election offering a second referendum. The party’s  manesto said on page : “Labour accepts the referendum result”. Depending on when an election takes place, and whether the UK has already left the EU, it could pledge to negotiate its own deal which it could then put to a referendum. Many Labour MPs, and many members of the Shadow Cabinet, believe there is no deal which can be stuck which would be better than being in the EU - opening the door to the prospect of Labour negotiating its own deal, putting it to a referendum and campaigning to Remain, effectively arguing against its own deal. Manestos are agreed at a ‘Clause V’ meeting where party officials thrash out their plans for Government.What do Labour’s Brexit supporters make of the latest position Brexiteer MP John Mann was scathing: “Labour will lose votes of those Labour voters who voted Leave,” he warned. The Labour Leave group tweeted: “Nothing the working class love more than being told to vote again until they get the answer right by the political class in London.” It added: “Labour is now a Remain party and that means one thing. We have lost million Labour Leave voters, possibly  MPs will lose their seats and Jeremy has lost the next general election.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour mps members launch bid","story":"NewsLabour MPs and members launch bid to ABOLISH BoJos private school Eton CollegeThe Labour Against Private Schools campaign hopes to pass a motion at Labour conferenceShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour Party members and MPs have launched a bid to abolish Boris Johnsonaposs private school Eton College. As Mr Johnson is set to become  the th Prime Minister to be educated at the exclusive college, Labour members are campaigning for elite fee-paying schools to be abolished.The nationwide campaign wants to push the party to commit to integrating all private schools into the state sector in the next Labour manesto. Labour Against Private Schools campaign hopes to pass a motion at Labour conference this September in an attempt to change the partyaposs policy on private schools. It wants backing for a motion to change Labour’s current policy on private schools, a promise to charge VAT on private school fees in order to pay for free school meals.    A staggering third of all British Prime Ministers were educated at Eton despite just % of the population attending private schools - never mind the Windsor-based college. It currently costs £,-a-year to send a child to Eton, with parents charged more than £, each term.  The campaign is being backed by MPs from across the party, including former Labour leader Ed Miliband, front bencher Clive Lewis, Laura Pidcock, Kate Green, Lloyd Russel Moyles, Rachel Reeves, and former teachers-turned-MPs Thelma Walker and Laura Smith.    Laura Pidcock, one of a number of Labour MPs already supporting the campaign, has said: With a third of British Prime Ministers being educated at just one school, the imminent coronation of Eton-educated posh boy Boris Johnson is a timely reminder of how a tiny network of elite people continue to dominate Britain’s political class. Whilst the privately educated are given a hand up into the most powerful positions in society by their friends in the Old Boy’s Club, talented, working class people continue to be met with slammed doors. The hoarding of power and privilege by private schools in this country must now be tackled. Labour will build a world-class National Education Service that will give everyone an equal chance.” Clive Lewis “Private schools are anachronistic engines of privilege that have no place in the st century. We can’t claim to have an education system that’s socially just when children in private schools have % more spent on their education than children in state schools”  Holly Rigby, a state secondary school teacher and one of the Labour Against Private School coordinator, has said: “There is no justication for the fact that young people’s opportunity to flourish and fulfil their potential is still determined by the size of their parent’s bank balance. The latest Sutton Trust research shows that the children I teach in Newham are statistically less likely to succeed in the most powerful jobs in this country simply because their parents couldn’t afford a private school education.I am certain that our Eton-educated political class have no more talent than any of the Free School Meals students I teach - we only have to look at Boris Johnson to see that is the case."},{"url":null,"title":"love island contestants very pumped","story":"NewsLove Island contestants are very pumped up with illicit drugs claims peerLord Addington spoke as the House of Lords debated calls to combat drug cheats at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games in ShareByNick LesterNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video love-island-contestants-very-pumped-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Daily Love Island stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome contestants on Love Island have clearly been very pumped up with illicit drugs, a peer has claimed at Westminster.

The pink bench, featuring unicorn designs and Aleshaaposs name, is situated at Childrenaposs Corner on Rothesayaposs promenade. But following a meeting of the Bute Community Council last month, chairwoman Marlene Hill said some island residents had requested that the bench be moved. Mary Lochrane slammed those who complained, describing them as sad sick pathetic people. In a post on social media, she said: There are people in Rothesaywho should be totally ashamed to call themselves human beings.  They are now complaining about our wee Princesses Bench and want it moved. Sad sick pathetic people thataposs all you are.

An extract from minutes at the community council meeting held on June  reads: Marlene Hill said she has been asked by a few parentsit is possible that the pink bench could be moved, as it is upsetting small children, because some of them think that someone will come into their house and murder them.    Marlene Hill said the pink bench is very prominent, and perhaps it might be better somewhere slightly out of town, facing towards the sea  The placing of flowers on benches was mentioned in general. Since then, Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of Aleshaaposs dad Robert, vowed to chain herself to the schoolgirlaposs memorial bench before letting it be moved. It comes just weeks after a memorial garden in Port Bannatyne, near to where the six-year-oldaposs body was found, was moved after neighbours complained about being reminded of the tragedy.

Eddie McIntosh has endured more than  years of anguish because of a legal wrangle over planning permission for the lavish development. And he could yet be jailed over the affair. The farming entrepreneur set up his eco retreat in rural Powys, Wales, in . His planning dispute with Powys council has so far cost the local authority £, in legal fees after a court case against Eddie held earlier this year.Eventually, it will also eventually see the farmer go to jailhe continues refusing to pay the fine he was issued, Wales Online reports.Now, the -year-old has opened up about the exhausting struggle for survival after being granted planning permission to keep his business only months after being told to tear it all down.    Eddie said: Itaposs been absolutely devastating. The amount of things Iaposve had to go through - my we and I have split, the business suffered, I lost the plot a little bit. Iaposm looking forward to getting back on track, especially considering years ago I was being nominated for best off-grid retreat and was on TV with Kevin McCloud. In  Eddie came across the -acre abandoned smallholding by accident. He had recently sold a Grade-II listed building in Gloucester and with about quarter of a million pounds behind him, he was looking to buy a lestyle in a rural setting. Driving through Powys in his motorhome, he saw an auction sign for the property and decided to buy it. His vision was to restore the land, establish a new smallholding and create an off-grid rural retreat offering education and alternative therapies for visitors. But just as his vision started taking off, it was forced to grind to a halt after planning permission was refused.    Eddie said: People look at me and think I didnapost submit planning permission in the first place but I did. I submitted it and it kept getting rejected so I piled on as much pressure on as possible. The bizarre thing is that these people never wanted to talk to me in the first place. They never discussed my project, it was only ever enforcement and legal action. In , Mellowcroft smallholding received a planning enforcement notice demanding Eddie take down everything from his treehouse home to the recycling point and classroom for visitors. The notice came only a year after his business had began to boom, and after featuring on Kevin McCloudaposs Man Made Home programme on Channel . Eddie said: It started just spiralling out of control. I have spent £, on planning applications and enforcement notices.  I wasnapost trying to hide anything, it was in the media and on my website. By , Eddieaposs planning application had been turned down and told his appeal was equally unsuccessful. Eventually, the planning inspector ruled the entrepreneur only had permission to use the site for agricultural purposes - meaning he would have to demolish the structures on the land and cease living in his home. Eddie insists he did comply with the order by the October  deadline, although he carried on living there, but thought he would be able to reuse some of the structures for agricultural purposes. He was eventually charged with  offences under the Town and Country Planning Act , all of which he denied. On February , a jury found him guilty of all charges following a four-day trial at Merthyr Crown Court. He was fined £ and told once more to stop living on the site - and remove all structures.    Eddie said: I tried to represent myself and that went wrong but couldnapost get legal aid. I am not going to pay the fine, I canapost pay the fine so I have to do the  days [in prison]. Iaposm not paying the costs on the moral principle that there was no charge to answer in the first place. Last Thursday, five months after Eddieaposs appearance in court, the Mellowcroft smallholding went up in front of the Powys Council Planning Committee one last time. On this occasion, it was for retrospective planning permission for agricultural purposes only. Perhaps unexpectedly, the application for the existing welfare cabin, silver birch sap production and storage building, farm office, storage shed and hut was granted - meaning Eddie will no longer have to tear down the structures that he lost his fight in court for. In total, a freedom of information request revealed Powys County Councilaposs legal costs to bring the matter to court mounted to £, - along with the £, it had previously cost them in enforcement action. Eddie said: Itaposs unbelievable to think [the council] have spent £, and itaposs just come to nothing.  It seems like a ludicrous farce really.

Video shows the festival goers wreaking havoc on the three-and-a half-hour flight - which was delayed because cabin crew struggled to control the rowdy hoard even before take off. But stewards did not see the funny side and were forced to call police to meet the revellers at the airport. Were you on the flight  If so get in touch withat webnews@trinitymirror  A disgusting clip shows one young reveller vomiting all over himself and the aisle as his mate holds a bag - while others look on grinning. Later he can be seen passed out in his seat, while his pals continue to yell and scream. Aneta and her partner said almost the entire flight was filled with people going to the festival - billed as the holiday for hard dance lovers. She said many of the festival goers ignored the fasten seatbelts signs and were shouting at other members of the group sat many rows of seats away during the safety talk.    She described it as like being in a nightclub without the music and said three men were arrested by police in Croatia once the plane landed. Support service manager Aneta, from Leeds, was sat right in the middle of the group travelling to Croatia for a two week holiday. “It was like being in a jungle with wild animals”, she said. “It was hell on earth. It was the worst flight of my le. It was absolutely appalling.    “The only way I can describe it is like being in a nightclub without the music ,ft above the ground. “They were shouting, chanting and the crew could not calm them down. “They were uncontrollable. No one could calm them down. It was completely unacceptable. All of them were drunk. The cabin crew threatened to throw them off several times.  “They were basically having a party on the plane. They were animals. “It was obvious they were drunk when they boarded the plane. No one was allowed to buy alcohol for the whole flight because they were so drunk. “It was unacceptable. The police came on when we landed before anyone was allowed to get off. “Three of them were taken away. They were being arrested. “It was a horrible experience.”  Aneta said the group appeared to be drunk even before they boarded the plane which took off an hour late, on Saturday. They could be seen stumbling around, riding around on suitcases and drinking in airport bars at Manchester Airport, she said. But everyone was allowed to board the plane, which was delayed as cabin crew battled to explain important safety information to the festival-goers. The “disgustingly drunk” Brits were travelling to Zabar for the Hard Island festival, at Zrce Beach, on the west coast. Hard Island Festival, which started on Friday, is billed as ‘The holiday for hard dance lovers’ and runs until Thursday. Aneta’s video footage shows one member of the group arguing with a female flight attendant who can be heard saying “we’ve called the police, you’re being arrested”.

One message sent by the vile abusers to Pamela Munro - whose -year-old daughter Paige Doherty was killed three years ago - said her two-year-old daughter should be raped and murdered. Police in Scotland are investigating and trying to find out who set up the account, which has been disabled. Tragic Paige was stabbed repeatedly by twisted killer John Leathem at a deli in Clydebank in March . Pamela, , who has set up a charity in Paige’s memory, told the Daily Record: “The messages are absolutely vile and what makes it worse is the fact that it was set up using my daughter’s name.    “They were sent to our charity page and I was shocked and horried at the content. “I just can’t understand why someone would want to do something so awful and use pictures of my children with horrendous messages across them. “Every day of our lives, we have to deal with losing Paige and people who do this type of thing should think of the pain and hurt it causes grieving families. “To hide behind a computer and send abuse of this kind is just callous, cruel and unacceptable.”    Pamela, also mum to Andrew, , Peyton, seven, and three-year-old Lucas, is now calling for tougher laws to unmask and trace online trolls. The Snapchat messages, too graphic to publish in full, target each of the children saying they should “kill themselves when they are older”, “get run over by a bus” and “be raped and murdered”. They also mock Paige’s brutal death. Pamela, from Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, said: “We reported it to police straight away and have been told they are investigating to try to discover who is behind the messages. “I just hope these trolls are never in a position where they lose someone they love the way I did. There’s no need to target families who are already going through so much. These people need to realise the impact they have and the damage they cause.  “It’s not only happening to us but to other people too and it has to stop. There needs to be strict laws against this type of behaviour introduced. “It should be an offence punishable with the full force of the law. “There have to be better ways of protecting victims of crime and their families and holding these trolls to account.”After burying her daughter and seeing twisted Leathem jailed for a minimum of  years, Pamela is determined to help others who have been robbed of a child. She set up Paige’s Promise, a charity offering self-defence classes, grief counselling and short breaks for bereaved families. She added: “Paige was always thinking of others and she would be proud her charity is helping people. We want her memory to live on. By doing this we can help to make a dference in the lives of people who need help after the loss of a loved one. “We’ve almost finished a memorial garden for Paige and it’s looking great. It’s somewhere we can go and think of the good times we had together. It’s a very peaceful place. “We are also planning more events over the next few months, one in particular that will help men struggling to deal with grief and loss.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sweet note ambulance staff left","story":"NewsSweet note ambulance staff left mum who parked illegally while rushing child into AESarah Moore from Morcambe ditched her car on double yellow lines outside a Lancaster hospital as she raced to get Lacie-Christina Moore into AEShareCommentsByDominic Moffitt:,  JUL NewsSarah jumped in her car after deciding the ambulance would take too long \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum rushing to get her badly injured daughter to AE ed to her hastily abandoned car to find a sweet surprise.

Kinder still, they had let her park in an ambulance bay over the road from the hospital. They didnapost have to do that, it made things a lot easier, the grateful mum said. I was fully expecting to come out of the hospital and to have a parking ticket, I had come to terms with that, they made me feel a lot happier and made it so much easier.

Lacie was running between the patio doors and me, my Nan has doors that open inwards so the hinges are on the inside.    Lacie tripped on the carpet and hit the hinges, I thought she was alright at first but when I picked her up there was blood everywhere. The sheer volume of blood terried Sarah who quickly switched into action mode. She said: When I saw the blood I thought I was going to pass out. I felt so ill, I asked my Grandma to take Lacie and we put loads of towels on her to stop the blood but it was everywhere, all over her face and in her mouth. There was no time to call for an ambulance so I just put her in the car and got her there in  minutes, it was scary. When she arrived at hospital Sarah ignored the warnings of ambulance staff about potential traffic wardens and raced inside. I arrived and just dumped the car, she said.    The NWPALS people were outside and they warned me about the ticket but I said: aposIaposm not botheredapos I just wanted to make sure my daughter was ok. The note she found on her car when she ed ensured a dficult day was made just a little bit easier. It read: Good afternoon, we noticed you left your car here as you rushed your child into AE. We spoke with the traffic warden and told him about your situation and managed to sweet talk him into letting you off under the circumstances. He wanted to us to let you know that you can leave the car in the ambulance bay across the road.

But the first man to set foot on the moon -  years ago this month - was also notoriously shy and, once back on Earth, lived a reclusive le out of the spotlight, rarely speaking about the mission, even with friends and family. Even photos taken from the surface of the moon only show his fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin, as it was Armstrong who took them and preferred to stay behind the camera. Armstrong died aged  in  but here, in the first of two parts, we reveal the build-up to and drama of the moon landings in his own words...    We were trailing. The Soviet Union had successfully put firstly an articial satellite into space, and secondly, put a man into orbit around the Earth. We had put only one flight, Alan Shepard, on a short -minute suborbital flight of about a hundred miles altitude and back down into the ocean. We’d never had a person in orbit, and now the President was challenging us to go to the moon. The gap between a -minute up and down flight and going to the moon was something that was almost beyond belief technically. But Nasa had identied the lunar landing as perhaps the only way we could catch up with the Soviet Union. And the challenge was enormous.    The first Apollo space craft was on a pre-flight test with the crew in the module atop the rocket on the pad at Cape Canaveral. A spark ignited some of the flammable material in the cockpit. The hatch was an inward opening hatch that the crew was unable to quickly open, and the crew was killed in the fire. It was a tragedy, and it was going to take us a long time to recover from that. The second flight was an eleven day flight to make sure that the command module had systems that would run for theof the lunar mission. That worked well. They decided they would take the next flight - Apollo  - on the big Saturn rocket, and not only fly it with humans on it but also take it around the moon. It was an enormously bold decision, but that moved our programme along a lot further. A few days later the boss called me and said, “Would you take the third flight down the road, Apollo  ” A month before the launch of Apollo  we decided we were confident enough that we could try an attempt a descent to the surface.    I thought we had a % chance of getting back down to earth on that flight, but only a   chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt. I never allowed myself the luxury of dreaming of being the team which would step foot on the moon. On the day of the launch, there was a certain relaxed atmosphere. You’re thinking, “We’ll get down to two minutes and then they’ll call a hold, then they’ll cancel the flight then we’ll go another day, so don’t get too excited here about this”. So, actually, when you actually lt off, it’s really a big surprise. The noise at lt off from the pad is extremely loud, you get not only the noise of the engine but the reflected noise that’s coming up off the ground. Until you fly out of that reflection after about  seconds it’s very dficult to hear anything, even with our special helmets and earphones on.    It’s a very shaky ride especially in that particular rocket, the Saturn , a , tonne machine with an energy enough to lt it off the pad. The second and third stages are just as smooth as the first stage is shaky. It was a striking event, leaving the planet and realising that there was no logical reason that you were ever going to fall back to that planet at some point. It was a slowly changing panorama as you went from just the horizon to a large arc, to a larger and larger arc, and finally to a whole sphere. The Earth is quite beautul from space. It looks quite small and quite remote, but it’s very blue and covered in white lace, the clouds, and the continents are very clearly seen. Greenland stood out, just as it doesn’t on the globe in your library, all white. Africa was quite visible, and we could see sun glint off a lake. There were a just thousand things to worry about in the final descent to the moon. It was hardest for the systems, it was hardest for the crew. It was the thing I most worried about, because it was so dficult. The unknowns were rampant. And in the middle of the descent our computer complained at us that it was having a problem. We had gone that far and we wanted to land.    We were getting good velocities and good altitudes. The navigation was working fine. There were no anomalies other than the fact that the computer was saying, ‘Hey, I’ve got a problem’. My inclination was to keep going ahead as long as everything looked like it was fine. So we continued on toward the landing site, but then the computer showed us where it intended to land and it was a very bad location. It was on the side of a large crater, about  metres in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders, not a good place to land at all. So I took over manually and flew it like a helicopter, out to the west, a smoother area with not so many rocks. We started losing visibility when we got a little below  feet. We starting picking up dust, and not just normal dust clouds like we would experience on Earth. This sheet of moving dust obscured the surface almost completely. This very fast, almost horizontally moving sheet of dust did not billow up at all. It just moved out and away in a straight radial sheet. The visibility continued to decrease as we got lower. I was able to get it down there safely before we ran out of fuel - we had about  seconds of fuel left. After landing we took a handshake - “Congratulations, we made it this far”. But there was a lot of work to do at that point, and we couldn’t luxuriate on those feelings. “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” That was the signature line for achieving the presidential goal that we had been working on for a decade, and in our view that was a very important statement.

The five F engines produced . million pounds of thrust – the equivalent of  F- fighter jets. The crew were accelerated to almost ,mph. Seeing the eclipseOn the fourth day, as Apollo  neared the Moon, it entered its shadow and got their first close up views of the Moon’s surface and the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Entering lunar orbitTo enter lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo  had to slow the craft by around ,mph by burning their engine. The timing was critical an overburn of just a matter of seconds might slow the Command Module enough to crash it. Seeing the far side of the moonAs the crew began to orbit the Moon they became some of the first people to see its far side. Only the crews of the earlier, pathfinder missions, Apollo  and Apollo  missions had been there before them. Moon LandingAs Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were making their descent to the Moon’s surface, they lost radio contact with mission control. They had become so low on fuel they came within less than a minute from having to abort the mission. The lunar module touched down safely but it was four miles downrange from the planned site. MoonwalkToward the end of his historic moonwalk, Armstrong’s heart rate shot up to an alarming  beats per minute. Not wanting to alert the world to the problem, mission control made a disguised request for Neil to slow down by checking equipment. The broken switchAldrin and Armstrong might have been stranded on the Moon. They discovered that one of the switches controlling the engine had broken off. Eventually, Buzz Aldrin armed the switch with a felt-tipped pen. Re-entry to Earth’s atmosphereThe astronauts relied on Earth’s atmosphere to slow them down on the trip home. But the angle at which they entered was critical with a margin of less than three degrees.

From there I caught a ferry from Harwich to Rotterdam and made my way to Stuttgart via Den Bosch and Venlo, which are also in Holland, and on to Koblenz, Mainz and Mannheim in Germany before ending up in Stuttgart.“Once there, I saw round the Stuttgart factory and museum before coming home by train.”Arthur decided to undertake his gruelling journey for Harlow’s Helping Hand as a former colleague had been helped by the fund.He added: “Along the way people asked me why I was cycling such a distance so I told them about Harlow and they kindly donated money. Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f2c032317a7.06468979-453x564.jpg ","title":"benjamin siegrist looking to make history as he aims for top flight place","story":"Benjamin Siegrist was flattered to be linked with a move to the English Championship over the summer.But other than to the Premiership with Dundee United, the Swiss goalkeeper isn’t planning of going anywhere for quite some time.Siegrist’s performances in the second half of last season, culminating in a string of five-star displays during the promotion play-offs, saw him watched by Nottingham Forest.That was nice to hear as he enjoyed a few weeks off last month but, as he focuses on the coming season with the Tangerines, fans will be delighted to learn it’s not turned his head.“It was nice but it just proved the point to me I know what I can do and I know where the standards lie,” he said.“I am more than happy here. I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part of pre-season.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening

post","story":"Calls have been made to scrap a £, director post at Aberdeen City Council.Frank McGhee quit his £,-a-year role as director of commissioning in March following a period of suspension.He was hired by the local authority in December  to head up commissioning as part of a radical restructure intended to eventually save £ million over five years.But since his suspension – the reasons for which remain unclear – the post has remained vacant.Opposition councillors are calling for the position to be scrapped entirely but the ruling Conservative, Aberdeen Labour and Independent administration said they won’t be “rushing into making any decisions”.Alex Nicoll, the SNP resource spokesman, said: “It’s now a number of months since the administration told us they would provide a route forward yet the silence has been deafening.“It’s clear, given their lack of action, that the post is obviously not required so they should take the opportunity to scrap it.“This sensible course of action would save the council the best part of £, this year alone – perhaps the administration could put some of that towards actually cutting grass and filling potholes across our city.”Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill also supports the proposals.He said: “I’m delighted the SNP agreed with what we proposed in March. We proposed getting rid of a director post given there was one vacant.“The Liberal Democrat group have been asking for some time what is happening.“Our staff deserve clarity and the people of Aberdeen deserve clarity. Our view is that we can lose that post, we can lose it permanently.”But, hitting back, Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: “As the SNP are aware, matters relating to staffing is a matter for the chief executive.“The next update on the operational activities around the TOM are due to be discussed in March  by all councillors.“We look forward to scrutinising the chief executive’s update report then before rushing into making any decisions that would renege on our commitment to change management within the organisation.”In his role, Mr McGhee was responsible for ensuring all the services provided by the council met local authority priorities.Aberdeen City Council adopted a new target operating model as part of a massive transformation of the local authority as it looked to slash £m from its budget over the next five years. As part of this,  posts were cut at the council in a bid to save £.m.The cash-strapped local authority has adopted a raft of measures aimed at reducing costs to help bridge a funding gap of £.m.Council chiefs have been blasted for axeing grass cutting in some areas of Aberdeen due to “severe” financial constraints."},{"url":null,"title":"mud maverick and music fyne fest 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWild and wet weather on opening night did not stop beer and music lovers from attending this year#s Fyne Fest.The muddy Cairndow field seemed to add to the fun as children jumped in puddles.It was only one rainy night and soon the sun was out to greet the acts as they took to the stages with wellies hitting the dance floor.More than  acts entertained beer-lovers over the weekend.

I love working with the tools and lining textures and patterns that come out.#It#s something to pursue in the future as an artist.

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"citizens-assembly-is-not-whether-scotland-independent","story":"Former Scottish Labour MEP David Martin made the comments as he admitted it was a ldquomistake for Nicola Sturgeon to announce the scheme at the same time as she rebooted the debate on a future referendum.In a bid to ldquokeep the political temperature down, Mr Martin made a direct appeal to sceptics during an event in Edinburgh.:SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC has made Citizens Assembly ten times harder, says adviserHe said the Citizensrsquo Assembly ldquois not going to decide whether Scotland should have a second referendum, because thatrsquos a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government, and theyrsquove already legislated for that.He added: ldquoItrsquos not a matter of when the timing of that will be, because thatrsquos a matter for the Scottish Government and the British Government to negotiate.ldquoItrsquos not even a matter of what the question should be.

However, the exact issues to be discussed are still unclear.:Tom Gordon: Citizens Assembly backlash is of the SNPrsquos makingAddressing the event in Edinburgh, Ms Cherry also insisted the Assembly ldquois not about whether or not Scotland should become an independent country.She added: ldquoMy personal view is that having a Citizensrsquo Assembly may assist on that path ndash others may think it may underline that the devolution we have is enough.

Though there is no doubt that Brexit has witnessed the most acute constitutional crisis in modern times, Mr Shafis frustrated call for Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government to ldquoface down the British state risks the abandonment of democratic practices which would utterly discredit Scotland on the international stage. His article is a clarion call for civil disorder and, as a former member of the Socialist Workers Party, clearly, but erroneously, based on Marxist ideals.Independence must be achieved, in the immediate or long-term future, within the parameters of what is democratically possible in Britain. A Boris Johnson premiership may well be completely repugnant to many Scots but that does not mean they will take to the streets and man the barricades until autonomy is granted. The Catalonian movement for independence has suffered a severe setback precisely by adopting the tactics suggested here by Mr Shafi.There is no better leader in Britain at present than Nicola Sturgeon. She remains committed to a civic nationalism, based on social democratic principles. Ms Sturgeon knows that some in the independence movement are becoming impatient and vocal, yet she steadfastly maintains that her stoical approach to independence is the correct one, protecting Scotlands interests whenever she can and promoting Scotland on the international stage, regardless of funding or support from Westminster.A gradualist outlook remains within the gt of the current Scottish Government. There is still a likelihood that a General Election can happen this year in the event of Brexit claiming more political casualties. The chances of the SNP becoming power brokers in a future British government are greater than they have been for a generation. Mr Shafi may learn that playing by Westminsters rules may not entirely be to the disadvantage of those who crave an independent Scottish state.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHAT more is to be said about Brexit, a curse visited upon this land by the Conservative Party  A curse which has moreover paralysed the leadership of the official Opposition.But no one as appalled as I am at the prospect of the disaster about to befall us can stay silent. I can think of one counter-force which will drive the undesirable values personied by Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and sundry others back over the Border, that force being independence: an independence forced upon the citizens of Scotland by the imposition of the aforementioned values which have overtaken the UKrsquos democracy and seriously damaged its political systems. I say this despite not being a nationalist, such being one who believes independence is a desirable end in itself, no matter the consequences.And so an argument for independence must be qualied by the honest and realistic use of the phrase ldquofor better or for worse, backed up by a commitment to protect the poor, the disabled and otherwise marginalised from the inevitable financial turbulence which a newly independent Scotland would inevitably have to weather. Nevertheless nothing, surely, can be worse than the forces on the point of being leashed upon us by the current manestation of hard-right English nationalism.However perhaps a rabbit can yet be pulled out of the hat and the UK saved from Brexit. So, in the meantime, I shall march in hope against the twin anathemas which are a xenophobic Faragism and the determination of the hardcore neo-Thatcherites who see in Brexit an opportunity to destroy and Americanise the Welfare State.John Milne, Uddingston.AT the Perth hustings, Scottish Conservatives were told by their leadership candidates that the Union comes before Brexit. Personally, I am sceptical about this, but I am sure Scottish Conservatives will be reassuredBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were to restate that stance at a major hustings in England, preferably in the glare of the press and television cameras.I dare them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BEFORE the SNP gives any further thought of trying to break up the UK perhaps it should give some regard to where goods and services exported from Scotland actually go. The main volume, amounting to more than pound billion in value, goes to England, and other parts of the UK. It does seem inappropriate to have any wish to fall out with those who are your best customers.Nicola Sturgeon would certainly appear very keen for an independent Scotland to become a member of the EU, yet Scotlands exports to Europe amount to only about poundbn. And could an independent Scotland actually afford the exorbitant fees to be a member of that grandiose club or in effect have any real say in its policies or agreements Scotlands export trade to the rest of the world for goods and services amounts to slightly over poundbn, much of which trade is currently negotiated through departments of the UK Government.But then, of course, Nicola Sturgeon has always been inclined to gripe about almost anything British.The SNP administration may well believe that one major source of income for an independent Scotland would be the whisky industry. The key player in this sector is obviously Diageo plc, with  distilleries, worldwide sales, but alas its registered office is in London. The distilleries belonging to this and other groups may be located in Scotland but in many cases these could be described as merely \"hollowed out\" contractors, with the financial controls located in other parts of the world. Along with many well-known brands has gone the ownership of their established whisky businesses. The corporation tax trail for any future Scottish exchequer could be fraught with dficulties.I believe that the only realistic solution is to carry on with the status quo, expand the UKs export trade, and faze out Nicola Sturgeon and her SNP cronies.

Whether the job is challenging or routine, whether the menopause is a mere blip or is so debilitating it represents a serious intermission in normal service, it makes an impact, and never in a good way.With an ageing population and the state pension fast receding, a prodigious number of women will be in work in advanced middle-age. As they navigate this troublesome stage, they need to know their bosses and colleagues are not sitting in judgement.Now that one case of mistreatment has been brought to book, every employer should be conscious that staff going through the menopause need more kindness and respect than ever. If the stigma and embarrassment of a wholly natural physical transition can be eased, then employees are likely to repay this solicitude with years of loyal service.

Lost names, sentences that cannot be finished, tasks left undone and forgotten are all part of the mental fog that descends asyoursquore scaling the Matterhorn. There can be sudden catastrophic loss of confidence, when ordinary tasks seem scary. Add to these meteoric mood swings and general aches and pains, and there are surprisingly few days when you feel like your real self.It doesnrsquot help that you wake in the small hours thinking yoursquove left the electric blanket on high, only to discover itrsquos you whorsquos imitating a kettle. Therersquos the prospect of office meetings where you dread the moment when ndash notndash your face grows so hot it could ignite a barbecue. You acquire a wardrobe dedicated to those occasions when itrsquos necessary to give a speech, or go for an interview, a lesson in multi-layering and breathable fabrics, regardless of whether a venue is likely to be over-heated. You could be in ice-bound Archangel, but your body will suddenly find itself near the Mediterranean, rustling up a Turkish bath up for you to enjoy.Read more: Why age isnrsquot a barrier to power in our youth-driven societyPerhaps the crimson face that afflicts women of a certain age is naturersquos way of making us visible. As almost all over-s know, by this point we have become wallpaper. Itrsquos hard catching the waiterrsquos eye, let alone hailing a taxi at rush hour. This is not necessarily bad. With invisibility comes power of a dferent sort, as Miss Marple knew to her advantage. But the fluster that the menopause creates brings attention of the wrong kind, a self-perpetuating vortex of public mortication that can only be cured by half an hour in a wind tunnel.It sounds comic, but itrsquos no joke. Especially not when you consider the escalating number of women working into their fties and beyond. Indeed,you were a conspiracy theorist, yoursquod think the cosmos was enjoying a grand jest at our expense. First, women need time off work to have, and raise, children. As a result, they risk slipping down the career ladder. Once back in harness, they scrabble to catch up. Yet no matter how much effort they put in, therersquos no escaping the awareness that therersquos little chance of fully retrieving the time and status they have lost.Then, just when a measure of equilibrium has been reached, the menopause looms. At the very age when we have acquired experience, confidence and perspective, when childcare days are over, and we are eager to throw ourselves into work, hormones step up a gear. Whether the job is challenging or routine, whether the menopause is a mere blip or is so debilitating it represents a serious intermission in normal service, it makes an impact, and never in a good way.With an ageing population and the state pension fast receding, a prodigious number of women will be in work in advanced middle-age. As they navigate this troublesome stage, they need to know their bosses and colleagues are not sitting in judgement.Now that one case of mistreatment has been brought to book, every employer should be conscious that staff going through the menopause need more kindness and respect than ever. If the stigma and embarrassment of a wholly natural physical transition can be eased, then employees are likely to repay this solicitude with years of loyal service. As those women who have passed through the night sweats, hot flushes and all the rest often say, happy days lie just around the corner. Theyrsquore like canoeists whorsquove shot the rapids, and found themselves in calmer waters at last."},{"url":null,"title":"wrong-devolve-immigration-policies","story":"True, the SNP policy on immigration dfers from that advanced by most political parties, in that it wants more of it, rather than to reduce it. It deserves credit for this, because itrsquos not an especially popular stance, and therersquos some evidence that it may cost it votes. But on demographic and economic grounds and, for the most part, general principles, the case for increasing immigration is overwhelming, because the arithmetic is pretty well indisputable.By contrast, the argument that mass immigration is overwhelming the native population, or national characteristics, social norms or the like is nebulous, tricky to demonstrate andfaintly disreputable,not downright racist. Indeed, until just a few years ago, most political parties simply ignored or aggressively disputed such cultural anxieties, though examples of social breakdown in places such as Govanhill, or of schools where the majority of pupils do not have English as a first language, indicate that those concerns are far from illusory.Nonetheless, such worries may be overstated, manipulated by populist politicians, or simply misdirected ndash with the failures being policy, or resource allocation, or misguided cultural relativism, rather than some essential feature of immigration. Theyrsquore at any rate not insurmountable polling in January suggested that, since the Brexit vote, the UK electoratersquos attitude towards migration has become more positive, with  per cent thinking its impact positive and only  per cent negative ndash almost exactly the reverse of the figures in June .This applies to Leave and Remain voters perhaps because Leave votersbelieve the Westminster Government will soon have control, or perhaps because their aim was always control itself rather than blanket opposition to immigration. The next Prime Minister will almost certainly ditch the blinkeredtarget figures that Theresa May so stupidly clung to, and voters seem perfectly relaxed about the prospect.But that distinction between control and numbers is the reason why devolution of immigration, like freedom of movement within the EU, is not really an option while Scotland remains within the UK, or for that matter, within the EU.The SNP is right to point to an impending demographic crisis in paying for pensions, welfare services and care for the sick and elderly, because the Scottish birthrate is at its lowest for  years, and the population is expected to grow by just . per cent by , considerably less than comparable EU countries.The Scottish Governmentrsquos also right that immigrants are a net economic boon the gain in tax revenue and productivity is so much more than the costs that itrsquos evidentially impossible to dispute, even for those who argue that wage suppression in the lowest-paid jobs, or costs in education, health and housing are signicant . Of course, Holyrood could try spending less, or attracting people from where in the UK with lower tax rates, butitrsquos not prepared to do that, immigration is one solution to the black hole in the budget.But you canrsquot realistically determine your own immigration policy while part of a larger union, whether itrsquos the EU or the UK, evenScotlandrsquos current concern is that Brexit may reduce the number of migrants. For now, anyone from any EU country can still set up in any other oneand anyone admitted to the UK can settle anywhere within it. There are forms of devolution that allow some incentives within that free movement regional subsidies to encourage industries or housing, or to promote population growth .The opposite can be done, by restricting access to aspects of welfare or services, although to a limited degree within EU rules. The UK, under Tony Blairrsquos government, chose not to apply them, but Scotland does apply some restrictions: for example, theof time you must be resident to qualy for university tuition ndash something which currently disqualies only rUK applicants.In fact, at the moment, Scottish Government spending priorities and taxation levels provide a disincentive for those of working age, particularly higher earners, and a strong incentive for students and retirees .I share Holyroodrsquos favourable view of immigration, and of its economic benefits ndash perhaps even its economic necessity ndash but itrsquos possible to provide more general incentives in areas that are already devolved. And it would be a good thing for the UK to rethink income qualications and skills requirements whatrsquos regarded as suitable for south-east England doesnrsquot necessarily fit the Highlands and Islands.To devolve immigration policy in its entirety, however, requires the erection of distinctions and controls between territories that dfer it is more or less a de facto declaration of full independence. A good reason, naturally, for the SNP to be keen on it, but a fairly obvious reason for it to remain a reserved power while the Union exists."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-rude-awakening-lunar-lines-tannoy-tricks","story":"MY goodness, the weather took a turn for the worse.

One submarine is always on patrol.ldquoStep two is removal of the keys and the triggers which would then be secured in a safe place on land.ldquoStep three is to disable the missiles. If key aspects of the guidance and control system are removed then a targeted launch is impossible. It should be noted that the actual missiles are rented from the US Navy.The development of a roadmap has been the main work stream of SNP CND over the past few months and is not the final word on the removal of Trident, but rather a guide.ldquoThis position paper is not the final word. SNP CND recognise that it will be fed into the SNPrsquos democratic processes.\"With the publication of the Trident Removal Road Map it is hoped that more SNP members will choose to join the hundreds who, since , have joined Scottish CND and thereby become involved in developing and promoting our anti-nuclear work generally and the Trident Removal Road Map in particular.\"The report touches on the previous work that has been carried out on the subject.ldquoThe technical challenges pertaining to the disarming of Trident were resolved in Ainsliersquos Disarming Trident, published by Scottish CND and freely available on the SCND Web site.:Trident merely a delusion of powerldquoIt is important to say at the outset that the technical steps which are outlined in Ainsliersquos work are seen as perfectly credible by a wide range of security experts, even amongst those, and there are some even within the SNP, who may a hold to the view that nuclear weapons are ldquoa deterrent.ldquoIn October  theHouse of CommonsScottish Affairs Committee published a report which acknowledged that Scottish independence could lead to nuclear disarmament for Britain and said that the timetable in the Disarming Trident report is realistic.ldquoThe Committee was a cross-party committee and they took expert advice from scientists.The Road Map says that removing Trident missiles ldquocan be achieved relatively swtly, though as Ainslie pointed out, the whole process including dismantling the warheads, would take four years.Speaking following a visit to Devonportto discuss the dismantling of redundant nuclear submarines, Douglas Chapman, SNP Defence Procurement and Nuclear Disarmament spokesperson told The National: ldquoWe are developing a clear roadmap which is an in-depth plan as to how Scotland can move to nuclear-free future.ldquoThese UK weapons are militarily ineffective, morally repugnant and a waste of public money especially when the costs associated with the new Dreadnought Class submarines are helping skew every other MoD conventional force budget.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amFollowing the euphoria of Mia McAllister#s silver medal yesterday, it is back to business for Team Orkney on day four of the  NatWest International Island Games in Gibraltar.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table.

Generation Identity and its ious chapters across Europe were last year banned from Facebook, with the web giant claiming they violated its policies against extremist content.The UK arm of the organisation is affiliated with the so-called Identitarian movement in Europe, which has previously attempted to sabotage refugee rescue ship efforts and block border crossings in the Alps.The group’s leader in Austria, Martin Sellner, was last month banned from entering the UK by the Home Office on the grounds of public security.Mr Sellner was previously found to have accepted a donation of €,from Brendan Tarrant, an Australian who has been charged over the murder of  people at two mosques in New Zealand in March. In March, Generation Identity was found to have displayed posters accusing a member of staff at the University of Glasgow of “racism” for supporting the “demographic replacement of Europeans”.Images of the group handing packages to vulnerable people in Glasgow were shared widely on social media last weekend.Simon Community Scotland, the homeless charity, said in a statement: “They are, we believe, a far-right racist organisation looking to recruit and influence vulnerable people.”William McNeil, a regional organiser in Scotland for Generation Identity, denied his group would only hand out packages to iniduals who were white.Asked by The Scotsman how he responded to allegations his group was promoting a hateful, white supremacist ideology, he said: “Anyone making this claim, intentionally or not, refuses to understand Identitarianism. It is not about skin colour, nor is it about anyone being better than another. All peoples have a right to preserve and promote their group identity in their homelands.”He said his group would continue with what he described as its community efforts.“We regularly carry out other charity actions – cleaning war memorials, for example,” he said.“It is important to us that we look after our local communities, where the government fails to do so.“As our numbers increase, so will our efforts to look after our communities.”Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney told The Scotsman: “This hateful cabal should get the message – they are not welcome in our city.“The fact that they are preying on the most vulnerable people in society to peddle their politics of ision shows that they are beneath contempt.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"menopause taboo campaign wins support of scottish government","story":"A new campaign to tackle the #taboo# of menopause and make women more aware of the symptoms has won the support of the Scottish Government.The Pausitivity campaign, which aims to tackle the stigma around menopause and ensure every GP surgery has easily available information for women, has received the backing of equalities and older people minister Christina McKelvie.Launched by former The Scotsman journalist Elizabeth Carr-Ellis, who found herself frustrated by a lack of information available at her GP surgery, the Pausitivity campaign also aims to empower women to spread the word themselves through social media.Around one-third of the UK’s female population are either peri or post-menopausal, with an estimated one in four of them suffering debilitating symptoms that can last more than a decade.Ms Carr-Ellis, who now writes the award-winning blog Sense, said: “Menopause hits every woman, but few are prepared for the symptoms beyond hot flushes. The campaign began with a Twitter discussion, with so many women saying there was basically no information about menopause freely available at the GP surgery, even though it was something that would affect every female patient the GP had at some point in their lives.“My GP had to print off information during the consultation and even then, one of the website links was no longer in use. None of us was prepared for how the menopause would hit us because nobody knew the symptoms. At school, you’re only told it’s when your periods stop. You’re not told how it can leave you feeling depressed or anxious, or how it can make you ache or forget things.“As we talked about how there were leaflets and posters for many other conditions on display to read or take away, I began thinking ‘why don’t we just do one ourselves ’”Scottish graphic designer Allyson Shields created the Pausitivity poster listing the major symptoms of menopause, including tiredness, joint aches and pains, vaginal dryness, heart palpitations, mood swings, anxiety and depression, forgetfulness, loss of libido and more.“The idea is for women to download it and share it,” Ms Carr-Ellis said.“We want women to put it on local community boards or at the gym or their work noticeboard – anywhere where women can see it. We also want them to share photos of their pinned poster on social media under the hashtag #KnowYourMenopause.“Hopefully, by knowing your menopause, we can help make le better for women around the country.”The Pausitivity campaign comes two months after Ms McKelvie led a Scottish Parliament debate on menopause in a bid to end the “deafening silence” around the subject.Ms McKelvie said: “The Scottish Government is happy to support Pausitivity’s campaign to raise awareness of the menopause. For too long it has been a taboo subject and not discussed as a natural part of ageing and le for women.“This has to change and there must be a much greater understanding in society of the symptoms that women face, how it can impact on their lives and what health services, employers and families can do to support women going through the menopause.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk government depriving scotland of brexit details","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Government civil servants have been deprived of key information relating to a no-deal Brexit by the UK government, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed. Her declaration comes after Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt claimed the Scottish Government was not making adequate preparations for a no-deal scenario.Former first minister Jack McConnell also warned relations between civil servants in Edinburgh and London had been hit by growing isions as a result of enhanced devolution. The claims are made in a new collection of essays published by the Smith Institute think tank today.Ms Sturgeon said the civil service in Scotland has “often worked well” with the UK-wide civil service despite “inevitable tensions”.But she said: “Our experiences have been mixed here, however.“The Scottish Government has also had to work with the UK government on the aftermath of the  referendum on leaving the EU.“The UK government has routinely deprived Scottish Government civil servants of important information – for example, on preparations for a no-deal Brexit – which I would expect to be made available. This is perhaps a reminder that, regardless of the professionalism and goodwill of civil servants, clear leadership from ministers is still absolutely essentialgovernment is toeffectively.”It is feared a no-deal Brexit could cost up to , jobs north of the Border. Ms Sturgeon has warned the Scottish Government will not be able to fully mitigate the impact.SNP ministers are concerned about a lack of information in key logistical areas such as how much ferry capacity will be available after exiting the EU and on what routes they will run. It is also not known what goods will be classed as “priority” and what arrangements will be made for Scottish needs, including the particular challenges of rural areas. It is also not known whether food exports can be integrated with imports, which would allow Scots goods to be shipped on the “outbound” journey.Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the Scottish Government was not doing enough to prepare for a no-deal scenario during a visit to Scotland last week, but declined to specy particular areas of concern.Lord McConnell says it is time to “refresh and renew a battered civil service”. He warns enhanced devolution has led to a freeze in relations between civil servants north and south of the Border.“Internally within the UK, respect for the autonomy of the devolved nations and the relationship between their ministers and civil servants leads to a lack of interchange now that is iding the practical experience of dferent levels of government,” he adds.“To tackle this, regular secondments and interchange should take place between UK departments and departments reporting to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast.“Top level civil servants in London, and in the devolved administrations, should have spent some of their career working at the other level, understanding the systems and dynamics at play there and understanding the relationships from both sides.” The former first minister warns there is a need for the civil service in the UK to be strengthened.“There are too many instances of covering up for ministers or colleagues and in these times of identity politics, where nationalism and patriotism can become confused, too many stories arise of promotions based on political loyalties,” he says.The collection of essays has been published in an attempt to “bring clarity” to the debate about the challenges of delivering an impartial civil service. Steve Barwick, editor of the collection and deputy director of the independent Smith Institute think tank, said it shows the “diligence and impartiality” of civil servants is respected by the vast majority of politicians.A UK Government Spokesperson said: “There are regular discussions at all levels between the UK and Scottish Government ahead of UK’s exit from the European Union to discuss the next steps in delivering Brexit in a smooth and orderly way.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind.

He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"limited sharing of brexit information shows uk total indifference to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was only released to the broadcaster on an appeal to the Information Commissioner. It was initially withheld, officials said because it was felt disclosure would \"weaken or inhibit\" their negotiating position and given Brexit was still \"live issue\" it needed to be considered internally \"freely and frankly\".The Brexit Gateway Review was compiled by experts in the Department of Finance and assessed the Brexit preparations carried out by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development- a key department in terms of cross-border trading in agriculture.It recommended a need for \"clear tactical and operational focus\" to prepare for the UKs departure from the EU from day one as well as a need to identy potential gaps that needed to be addressed. It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit. In that eventuality the British Government needs to act in line with the Good Friday Agreement and announce a referendum to give people the option of remaining in the EU through Irish reunication.”A DAERA spokesman said it had an \"excellent working relationship\" with its colleagues in London."},{"url":null,"title":"amendment a fantastic victory says armaghborn mp mcginn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He made the comments after the government published an updated #Brexit preparedness plan @PA pic tcqpNI— Michelle DevaneJuly , “It will make it more dficult for the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement toand it will be a fundamental disruptor to the all island economy as it s today seamlessly,” he said.“There is no sugar coating of that message. For people living in border counties and in Northern Ireland, this will be really dficult.“In a no-deal scenario, while we will prevent physical infrastructure, undoubtedly the imposition of tarfs and the need to protect the integrity of the single market, to keep Ireland in the single market that we have been part of creating, will provide a disruption to the all-island trade which is something that we will all work intensively to avoid.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tanaiste Simon Coveney Mr Coveney told the media that the “overarching theme” of the document is a stark message that there is no good news in a no-deal Brexit for Ireland, Northern Ireland or the UK.“This will be a very, very dficult issue for Ireland to deal with but this document is about mitigating where we can the negative impacts of that scenario should it unfold,” he continued.The -page document states that a crash Brexit would pose “unique and unprecedented” challenges for the UK, the EU and Ireland.The extensive report further states that a no-deal would be an exercise in damage limitation and it would also be “impossible” to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors.It also found that a no-deal Brexit will have severe negative impacts in a number of sectors and among smaller and medium-sized businesses, and it will be widely felt on a regional basis.It also warned of signicant job losses in the most exposed sectors in a no-deal scenario, with an estimated increase in unemployment of -, after the UK leaves the EU.It further said that tarfs and checks and controls on UK imports will be disruptive to trade across the Irish Sea.The report also said that the consequences of the UK crashing out of the EU could be “very damaging” for the political process in Northern Ireland.“If the institutions are not in place at the time of a no-deal Brexit, there is a risk that the UK Government might initiate a move to Direct Rule in Northern Ireland as a response to managing the sht to new post-Brexit arrangements,” the report added.“A no-deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels.“These implications involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges.“Notwithstanding mitigation measures in place, potential disruption to daily le in areas such as online retail purchases from the UK, access to medicines, and medical devices, and financial services sourced from the UK.”Mr Coveney continued: “We will need to take some action somewhere in our economy to ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the products that are then going to be sold on out of Ireland but we are not going to put checks on the border or close to it.”He said Ireland needs to make sure the integrity of single market is protected and that a situation does not arise where there is an “unguarded backdoor” through Northern Ireland into the EU single market which would “in effect take Ireland out of the single market against our will”.“We as a government can’t allow that to happen and won’t allow it to happen,” he added.Mr Coveney said that, personally, he does think the UK will crash out of the EU on October .“I’m not a gambler, it’s just as well with Brexit,” he added.“It’s a very real risk now and we need to be prepared for it in a very real way.“One of the warnings I’ve given this week to businesses is that we can’t suffer from the boy who cried wolf mentality here.“We’ve had a number of occasions where we’ve been marched to the top of the hill and then all of a sudden there’s been an extension.“And anybody who assumes that somehow someone is going to pull a rabbit out of a hat between now and October I think is being very naive. People need to prepare for all Brexit outcomes.“Others have suggested that there’s some evil plan on a shelf somewhere that can be implementednecessary.

Acting commissioner Ian Gordon found that Mr Husseyhad breached the local government code of conduct for councillors, specically a paragraph which says councillors \"must not bring their position as a councillor, or their council, into disrepute\".The conviction related to an incident in September  in which the alderman was involved in a crash in Castlederg.Mr Hussey, who served as deputy mayor last year, pleaded guilty and was convicted of driving with excess alcohol, driving without due care and consideration and failing to report an accident. At the hearing yesterday, acting commissioner Ian Gordon \"noted a number of mitigating factors in the aldermans favour, including his previous good service and compliance with the code, an apology and his co-operation with the investigation from an early stage\". However, Mr Gordon said the \"mitigating factors were substantially outweighed by a number of aggravating factors\". He noted it was the aldermans third conviction for drink driving. Mr Hussey had known he was over the limit but made a deliberate decision to drive and caused physical harm to the other driver involved in the collision. Mr Gordon said he \"was also not persuaded the alderman had demonstrated sufficient insight into the seriousness of his actions and the potential consequences for the public and the council\". He said he \"could not be satisfied the behaviour would not be repeated\".In  Mr Hussey was convicted of drink driving for the first time. In  he was banned from driving for three years after admitting drink driving again. A judge warned him that he could face jail should he be convicted again.Last year the UUP man, a former schoolteacher, stood down as chair of the policing and community safety partnership following pressure from families who had lost loved ones to drink drivers.Despite his convictions, Mr Hussey was elected back into office in May, retaining his seat in Castlederg. His council disqualication will begin on July . He told the Belfasthe would appeal the decision. Alexander Redpath, from Peter Bowles and Co Solicitors, representing Mr Hussey, said his client had co-operated with the investigation from the outset. \"At no time has he sought to justy or defend his actions,\" he added.\"Drink driving is unacceptable and a sanction in this case was inevitable. \"However, we are very disappointed that a disqualication was handed down.\"We believe this is out of line with recent similar cases before the commissioner which resulted in suspension. \"Alderman Hussey will be appealing the decision and we are in the process of preparing his application.\"A UUP spokesperson said the party would ensure the Derg area was \"well represented\".\"We have always been of the view that drink driving is unacceptable and the decision reflects that view,\" they said.\"We will be taking steps to ensure that the people of Derg are well represented in alderman Husseys absence and will make no further comment at this time.\""},{"url":null,"title":"travellers need to see their faces reflected in parliament seanad hears","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

as community representatives addressed senators for the first time since the state formally recognised the community as an ethnic minority in March .Martin Collins of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre said there were innovative ways to give a voice to indigenous ethnic groups.When Travellers look at our parliament, at both houses of the Oireachtas, we need to see our faces reflected in these parliaments, andthat were to happen I think this would deconstruct this notion that our parliament is the sole reserve of the majority populationMartin Collins“We can look, for example, at having quotas of Travellers in our national parliament,” he said.“We can look at the whole concept of reserved seats, which is a tried and trusted method of supporting the inclusion of indigenous groups right across Europe.”Mr Collins added: “When Travellers look at our parliament, at both houses of the Oireachtas, we need to see our faces reflected in these parliaments, andthat were to happen I think this would deconstruct this notion that our parliament is the sole reserve of the majority population.”Mr Collins said that the Council of Europe had recently recommended that Irish authorities introduce legislative changes to adequately reflect the composition of Irish society and better take account of the needs of the Traveller and Roma communities.He said other countries had managed to do so.He cited Romania, where he said the Roma community had a voice in the national parliament through innovative structures.“There can be no signicant or sustainable change unless Travellers and Roma themselves are empowered to fully participate and influence policy that creates positive change for our communities on the ground,” Mr Collins said.Kathleen Sherlock, co-ordinator of Minceirs Whidenalso called for positive legislative measures to be implemented to ensure Traveller inclusion at a local and national level.The Traveller community is in a crisis situation, the likes of which our community has never experienced beforeKathleen Sherlock, Minceirs WhidenShe said issues affecting Travellers were “not just about culture and identity, which is very, very important, but actual survival of our people”, and she called for specic seats for members of the Traveller community to be reserved within the Dail, Seanad and local councils.“The Traveller community is in a crisis situation, the likes of which our community has never experienced before,” she said.“We recognise that the anti-Traveller bias that exists within Irish society does play a part in this crisis, however it must be stated that the root cause is the result of successive Irish governments’ actions and inactions relating to the Traveller community.“There is no community of people in Ireland that has been so negatively impacted by political decisions and political inactions as the Traveller community.”Trinity College Dublin PhD student and member of the Traveller community Patrick McDonagh said the creation of a seat for Travellers in the Senate would go some way towards rectying the lack of trust that the community feels towards the Irish state.“When you look at our political system, you do not see Irish travellers present,” he said.Mr McDonagh said all too often members of the Traveller community were seen as “the freaks”, and that that perception needed to be dealt with.He told senators that “deliberate policies” aimed at encouraging members of the community to participate in political le such as the creation of seats would “mark the beginning of what would still be a long journey to giving travellers a role in the state, in proportion to our place and population within it”.He added that it would be important for all four major political parties to start selecting travellers to run at all levels.“Irish travellers cannot expect others to speak for themthey’re not willing to speak for themselves and I think education would be one of the great motivations and drive in changing that,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"bmw stops uk production of engines for south africa factory due to brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Under a “tied” lease, pub tenants must buy a certain amount of beer from their landlords, but they can ask to break free of the tie using a “market rent only” option.This arrangement means they may still be required to stock the brewer’s beer – but strict limits have been set on how much they are obliged to buy since the pubs code came into effect.Paul Newby, the pubs code adjudicator, said the PCA “decided to launch this investigation to understand the extent to which the pubs code may have been broken and the potential impact on Star tenants”.Fiona Dickie, the deputy pubs code adjudicator, added: “Where tenants of a brewer business regulated by the pubs code exercise their right to ask to go free of tie, they may still be required to stock that brewer’s beer or cider within limits set out under the pubs code.“This investigation concerns whether Star has been going beyond those limits by offering non-compliant terms.”The PCA will now ask Star’s pub tenants whether the company tried to force them to stock just Heineken keg beer, or an unreasonable volume of Heineken brands or other drinks in which the Dutch brewer has a financial interest.It will also ask them whether Star tried to influence the retail price of its brands under the arrangement.It has set a deadline of pm on August  for responses.Ms Dickie said: “It is important that Star tenants and other interested parties provide us with information to support this investigation.“Their information will help us to determine whether the pubs code has been broken and,so, what further action should be taken.”Heineken tripled the size of its UK pubs business with the £ million takeover of Punch in ."},{"url":null,"title":"man puts on 15 jumpers to avoid paying excess","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He then drove back home and picked up his we Phyllis, collected his mother and father-in-law and drove to Buncrana where they played a round of Pitch and Putt. The family then asked looked around the Inishowen town for holiday accommodation for later in the summer before ing to Derry.That evening, they all had a fry for their supper and then Sammy drove his mother and father-in-law home before ing to William Street again. Sammy watched television until midnight and headed for bed about .am. Mrs Devenny followed him up around .am and recalled that Sammy “was in the best of form.”As she got into bed Phyllis said Sammy said “oh dear” and was panting and wheezing. She wasted no time in calling a priest and a doctor and her neighbour Mrs Myra Doherty. When Fr Mulvey and Fr McCullough arrived, Mrs Devenny left the room.  Sammy Devenny died around .am on July , just as Dr Clarke arrived at the house.Mr Devenney’s remains were formally identied by his son Harry and the Post Mortem examination was carried out by State Pathologist Dr TK Marshall on the day of the death.The cause of death was established as coronary atheroma and old thrombosis. The central question surrounding the death of Sammy Devenny has always been whether it was caused by the injuries sustained during the RUC assault.When conducting the Post Mortem examination it was noted by Dr Marshall that in , Mr Devenney had complained to his doctor of aches in his left shoulder and lower left side and the back of his chest but nothing sinister had been found at that time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs a result the Pathologist did not state that the death had been caused the injuries taken during the attack. Also, Dr Pantridge at the Royal Victoria Hospital believed that death occurred from natural causes and the assault was not a contributory factor.And, Dr Vine, Consultant at Altnagelvin agreed with the others and suggested thatthe heart attack was the result of the attack by the RUC it probably would have occurred immediately.But, Dr Clarke, partner in the practice of Dr Kinsella, the Devenny family’s practice said that the assault on Sammy Devenny and his children and the acute nervous tension arising from contributed to the heart attack.The Inquest into the death of Sammy Devenny was opened on July ,  and was conducted by Coroner MF Leslie who recorded that: “The jury, having heard all the evidence and in accordance with the medical evidence placed before them,a verdict of death by natural causes.”By occupation, Sammy Devenny was an undertaker and hearse driver for the firm of McClafferty and Sons in Derry. He was regarded by everyone as a quiet and mild-mannered man and had never been involved in any political agitation.Newspaper reports recorded that his funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen and was attended by an estimated , people.CAPTION: The remains of Sammy Devenny being carried past his home in William Street."},{"url":null,"title":"llanidloes town council responds severn porte park upkeep critics","story":"Severn Porte, Llanidloes.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The long range forecast reckons that the warm, dry spell may continue.BALLYGOWAN mdash Two hundred workers at the ropeworks factory in Ballygowan will lose their jobs within the next three months.A spokesman for the Belfast Ropeworks Company Ltd, the owners of the factory, says that heavy losses have been sustained in recent years and therefore all production will have to be brought to a halt.The workers, both male and female, will be declared redundant during the course of the next  weeks. The marking and selling activities of the company will be unaffected and customers will continue to be supplied.The company spokesman said he regretted that it had become necessary to cease the manufacture of rope and twine products and carpet fibre at the local factory.ldquoThe cost of production at Ballygowan has consistently exceeded what the market can bear, while the remoteness of the factory from its principal market in Great Britain imposes a further burden in respect of prohibitive transport costs, particularly for finished goods, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick Young Farmers had a very successful day at the th annual Young Farmersrsquo county rally on Saturday. Out of the  clubs Downpatrick gained maximum points to won both the Farm Tasks Shield and the Rally Shield.Overall, the club achieved a high number of placings, including a second from Pat Turley in weed identication and a first from Vincent MacNabb in soil assessment.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Energy has no future plans to use Strangford Lough as an experiment centre in the battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.More than  months ago scientists gained valuable information for a sea trial buoy which was built at the marine biology station in Portaferry and nearby at Marffield Bay.A Department of Energy official has informed the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, that no further tests at Strangford Lough are planned at present.The official was answering a question raised by Mr Powell in the House of Commons asking whether the Department had taken into account the experiments in the lough.During the experiments scientists monitored radio signals from the buoy which experienced a wide range of weather conditions during a one-month period.The device was small scale, but it gave scientists enough information to produced a design for a full scale device. It is thought that a chain of such buoys could one day be one of our main sources of power..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street open again after three month delay  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Irish Street finally reopened to two-way traffic last weekend after a protracted environmental improvement scheme took twice as long to complete than originally planned.Contractors removed barriers to allow the flow of two-way traffic on Friday evening but traffic lights at the Market Street junction mdash which were permanently on red during work on the pound, public realm project mdash were not adjusted.Motorists arriving at the bottom of the street were left confused and had to carefully ease across the busy junction and while the traffic lights remained stuck on red the following morning, they were finally adjusted.The street is scheduled to be closed to all traffic this weekend as the final touches are put to the environmental scheme which will see the road between the Market Street and John Street junctions resurfaced.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, has admitted that the delayed public realm scheme had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.In addition, government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the business community affected by the overrunning project better informed.In May, business owners and traders took part in a protest at the delay in completing the environmental revamp to provide new granite paving, street lighting and furniture. The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

By any ordinary reading of the Bill in question, the issue of abortion should not have been within scope. However, the authorities of the House of Commons decided otherwise.An amendment by Stella Creasy MP was selected and the House of Commons last night voted in support her amendment. At the time of writing, it is not fully clear what precisely this amendment will mean for the law on abortion in Northern Ireland. However, it certainly could lead to the ‘decriminalisation’ of abortion in Northern Ireland, allowing for widespread access to abortion on request. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Abortion is a sensitive and complex issue which is part of the reason why decisions around it are devolved.Meddling in such a sensitive issue at such a sensitive moment sets a constitutional precedent which could affect the devolution settlement in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland again in future, on a whole range of issues. In short this move is constitutionally insensitive and inappropriate.The Northern Irish public have not been consulted upon around the detail of the amendment that was passed and this is not the way to pass legislation on such a sensitive social issue. Last minute amendments to a bill which is nothing to do abortion with no consultation with the society affected hardly seems an appropriate way to proceed.The irony is that in a recent inquiry by the Women and Equalities Committee at Westminster % of submissions said no to Westminster imposing law change on abortion in Northern Ireland. Existing law in Northern already allows for abortion in carefully limited circumstances. Contrary to many reports these circumstances have included instances of sexual crimeand where the baby may not survive beyond birth. This more limited law has led us to estimate that over , people are alive in Northern Ireland today because politicians here did not implement the  Abortion Act. This figure was researched by the Both Lives Matter campaign and robustly tested and upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority.Behind many of these moves to widen abortion law in Northern Ireland is the idea that abortion is the measure of progress for women in society.Limited law change is never enough that is not where the campaign for abortion is going. The ultimate destination is based on the ideology that women are only as free as their ability to end the lives of their unwanted unborn children. This is a tragic vision for women where their ‘freedom’ can only be achieved by the devaluing of every future human being. following the unanimous acquittal of Mr Jackson and Mr Olding over an allegation of rape last spring\"   following the unanimous acquittal of Mr Jackson and Mr Olding over an allegation of rape last spring\"  Innocence before guilt is the bedrock of the justice system – no shortcuts allowedThe Tories are in turmoil, but the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is in trouble too Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Many people see a much more positive vision for women and their unborn children. One where both lives are respected and can flourish together as far as humanly possible. The abortion laws in Northern Ireland may not be perfect, maybe abortion laws will never be, but they hold together the le, health and dignity of both human beings in a careful and delicate relationship. This is something we should be celebrating as foundational to our way of le together here as Catholic, Protestant and those of no faith.It is too important to become a political football or circumvented by clever politicking at Westminster.This vote at Westminster has been met with dismay in many quarters in Northern Ireland.What can I promise is this – I believe ‘both lives matter’ always and as long as I am privileged to be an elected representative, I will stand up for that belief.

It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
