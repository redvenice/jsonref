Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams.

I knew Tom was going to throw it up there and (I could) just run up and make the play. It was a crucial play, and Sony just did the job finishing it off with a touchdown, which was awesome.\u0027Gronkowski was willing to clarify one question about his future: Yes, he planned to party Sunday night and beyond.\u0027Bill (Belichick) said he\u0027s partying tonight, and I ain\u0027t going to let him out-party me,\u0027 Gronkowski said with a grin.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass.

He said to me, “Brod, shall I go gay?” That is a fact. We all roared with laughter and moved on. I think the market was so narrow… and of course she had to be a virgin.’When responding to a remark that there were few around, Munro-Wilson said: ‘There were probably none, and I think it was a tricky one for him.’Paxman himself started at Cambridge when Charles began his third year. ‘You certainly never saw him in the pub,’ says the presenter.Das boob!

Reticulated pythons are being slaughtered by the thousands deep in the Indonesian jungle (Pictured, a python hangs in a workshop for skinning snakes in Cirebon, Indonesia)           The snakes are smashed on the head with a mallet — not hard enough to kill them, just to stun them  (Pictured, a worker slices along the backbone to remove the skin)For while most of us consider using real fur for clothes as a massive ethical faux pas (and, in response, most fashion houses have turned to artificial substitutes), less attention is given to exotic skins.\u0027Snakes aren\u0027t cute and cuddly in the same way foxes and rabbits are,\u0027 says Yvonne Taylor, of the animal rights group PETA. \u0027But just like mammals, they are sensitive to pain and suffering.\u0027Yet the traffic in exotic animals for flesh and skins is the third largest — after weapons and drugs — in the world. Every year, about 500,000 python skins are imported from South-East Asia to Europe legally, complete with the correct paperwork from CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which aims to protect specific species from extinction by regulating their trade).Often they are sent to tanneries in Italy where the skin is chemically treated so it can be turned into designer accessories.In addition to the legal trade, skins worth £600 million are imported illegally into Europe every year, often via Singapore.           Supermodel Kate Moss, pictured at a Gucci party in 2014, popularised the snakeskin pattern in fashionThese may have dodgy CITES paperwork — as Scolaro\u0027s allegedly had — or no paperwork, and are invariably wild snakes that have been hunted down by locals and \u0027laundered\u0027 through snake farms who sell them for vast sums.In the wild and left to its own devices, a Burmese python will cover a territory of eight square miles and can expect to live for up to 30 years.On a farm, a reticulated python — which can grow to about 30ft and weigh up to 20st — can barely uncoil and is lucky if it makes it past six months.According to Clifford Warwick, a biologist and former snake farm investigator, many are kept in a \u0027racking system in what look like haberdashery drawers in a vast warehouse\u0027.He adds: \u0027Each tiny drawer contains one snake and the only natural light comes from a tiny opaque window at the front.\u0027When they grow out of this, they are transferred into wire crates, with hundreds of other snakes and, if they live long enough, to an inidual large crate.The fact is that snakes wither in captivity. They are prone to parasites, bacterial infections, problems with their immune systems and stress.\u0027Snakes in cages show up to 30 different types of stress,\u0027 says Mr Warwick.They are fed on rats, mice and bits of chicken, but grow slowly — about 10ft in three years, which is far too long a time for most snake farmers\u0027 balance sheets.So they pay locals to hunt wild reticulated pythons — which are easy to catch with the help of a stick, a mallet and a hessian sack — and drop them off by the sack-load to be slaughtered.Last week, Yuda Mukti, 39, a snake catcher from Kertasura Village in the Kapetakan District of Java, Indonesia, boasted that in the height of the rainy season — the optimum snake-hunting conditions — he can collect a ton of snakes in just three days.He passes them on to a processing plant or \u0027farm\u0027 where they are either inflated with compressed air or water.According to Mr Warwick, these farms are largely a front used to hide the fact that most pythons have been illegally hunted.\u0027Though they always try to disguise them, if you look closely at a designer handbag or a boot you often see blemishes, little scars — scrapes and nicks they picked up in the wild,\u0027 he says.          A worker at a workshop for skinning snakes handles a live snake brought in by a snake hunter in Cirebon, IndonesiaWith today\u0027s obsession in the West with veganism, vegetarianism, ethical food production and sustainable fashion, one might wonder who on earth would want to buy \u0027luxury snakeskin accessories\u0027? As PETA\u0027s Yvonne Taylor puts it: \u0027We\u0027re already moving from what\u0027s in your fridge to what\u0027s in your wardrobe.\u0027Most millennials, however rich, wouldn\u0027t be seen dead with a python bag on their arm.Particularly when there\u0027s now such a booming market for fake snake accessories made from embossed eco-friendly fabrics that are coloured to replicate the most beautiful pythons.Indeed, some fashion houses have now stopped using exotic skins.In December, Chanel, which previously sold handbags, coats and shoes made from snake, alligator and stingray skins, announced it would not use exotic animal pelts in future collections.Flamboyant designer Vivienne Westwood has vowed to steer clear of exotic skins. Diane Von Furstenberg has followed suit.However, Paris-based Kering, the company behind brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, is heading fast in the other direction.In 2017, and to great fanfare, the company opened its own python farm in Thailand.Bosses promised that the snakes would be raised in \u0027the best conditions for animals, farmers and the eco system\u0027 before they are turned into shoes, bags and belts.Kering said it was aiming to provide a sustainable source of skins and made much of its CITES certification.          Every year, about 500,000 python skins are imported from South-East Asia to Europe legally, complete with the correct paperwork (Pictured, a factory in Pekalongan)Which all sounds fine, of course, until you remember that Kering has invested its money not out of the goodness of its heart or a desire to protect these animals, but because of a vested interest in keeping the python and exotic skins trade going.According to Clifford Warwick, there is no evidence that the conditions or slaughter methods used by these farms — in this case thought to be drowning in a crate — are much better.\u0027Pythons are not humanely raised and they\u0027re not humanely killed,\u0027 he says.\u0027It\u0027s all about protecting the skin, not the animal\u0027s welfare.\u0027He says that the only 100 per cent humane way is giving the snake a sedative followed by a lethal injection.But while this is a cheap method and would protect the snake\u0027s precious skin, it would render the snake meat unusable and bosses worry about the unsupervised use of toxic chemicals on their farms.Meanwhile, back in Indonesia, the impact of the python trade ripples out. Removing hundreds of thousands of predators from the wild upsets the food chain.Rats are their main prey — a python eats a dozen a month — and local explosions in the rat population result in plague epidemics and cause parasites to ravage rice fields — the staple local crop.Even the hunters are exploited. They spend night after night combing through jungles and swamps to track down their quarry only to be paid pennies for something that will eventually sell for thousands of pounds and find its way onto the arm, back, head, waist or feet of someone who really should know better.Or, just maybe, it won\u0027t.Because hopefully, anyone tempted to splash out on a python skin product, however beautiful the diamond pattern, however exquisite the workmanship, however festooned it is in CITES certifications, will remember the images of Stephanie Scolaro\u0027s utterly tasteless £450 baseball caps.And, hopefully, they will bring to mind Yvonne Taylor\u0027s salutary words: \u0027There is no such thing as an exotic ethical skin.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Ancient artefacts Iraq returned home Jordanian officials 1 300 piece stash","story":"    Antiquities recovered from Jordan are displayed at the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad          Iraqi Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Abdulameerr al-Hamadani, gives a press conference at the Iraq National Museum          An Assyrian artifact is displayed at the Iraq National Museum. Iraqi Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Abdulameer al-Hamadani said the recovery of 1,300 pieces of antiquities that Jordanian authorities confiscated from smugglers is a \u0027milestone\u0027Al-Hamadani is now asking the international community to support Iraq in its quest to recover its antiquities.The return of the artefacts came as Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and his Jordanian counterpart Omar Razzaz revealed a new, united front.On Saturday the border crossing between the two nations was officially reopened after a deal signed between them which includes boosted trade.From now, Iraq will supply Jordan with 10,000 barrels of oil a day at a lower price.Iraqi goods imported via Jordan\u0027s Aqaba port would also receive preferential tariffs, the Jordanian prime minister\u0027s office said while Jordan would begin to export electricity to Iraq within the next two years.AirBnB invasion: Hundreds of drug-fuelled partygoers take...BBC Question Time host Fiona Bruce attempts to end the...Revealed: Surgeon jailed for £180,000 burglary scam was...Share this article    Iraqi Antiquities are on dispaly during a press conference held by the Iraqi Minister of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities          Abdulameer al-Hamadani called on the international community to support Iraq in its quest to recover its antiquities          The hundreds of ancient pieces which included huge stone statues were returned home           The Assyrian artefacts were stolen from the country but were returned under a great fanfare  "},{"url":null,"title":"Britains richest man Jim Ratcliffe blasts Vivienne Westwood icons opposition fracking","story":"    Britain\u0027s richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe (above) has launched a blistering attack on Dame Vivienne Westwood  over her opposition to frackingBritain\u0027s richest man has launched a blistering attack on Dame Vivienne Westwood over her opposition to fracking.Chemicals tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe – who is worth £21billion – said the designer did not care about the jobs it would create, and accused her of living in a London bubble.Dame Vivienne, 77, hit back, calling Sir Jim, 66, a liar bent on destroying the environment.His firm, Ineos, is a key player in the dash for shale gas.

Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass.

I could list more examples, but what should be abundantly clear is that breaking down in an active motorway lane is incredibly dangerous.And because of the fatalities and near-misses, more and more people are questioning the wisdom of these supposedly ‘smart’ motorways.Among them is Tracey Crouch, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, who is part of an all-party group of MPs which is backing campaigners who maintain that the absence of a hard shoulder puts motorists and recovery workers at risk.          Ellie Montgomery ended up in a neck brace after her broken-down car was slammed into by a lorry travelling at 50 to 60 mph on a ‘smart’ stretch of the M6Ms Crouch wants a halt to the introduction of smart motorways without hard shoulders.‘We need the Government to pause and reflect on whether we’re getting this right … until we have a better understanding about how we can protect those who have broken down and the recovery workers that come to assist them,’ she said in a recent interview.Ms Crouch is not the only respected voice who has such misgivings. Joining her is Dave Blundell of the Police Federation, who said last week that such motorways are making it hard for police patrols to do their jobs properly.Smart motorways are ‘difficult for the police to operate on’, he said. ‘There’s no hard shoulder, so where do we safely stop another motorist if they have committed an offence or we want to give them some advice?’‘The answer is that we can’t. We have to wait miles and miles and miles until there is a hard shoulder and we are able to do that. There are lots of questions that need to be asked.’Indeed there are. And here are just a few for starters.What exactly is a smart motorway? What are they for? What do they cost? How many miles of smart motorway are there? Are they not just revenue-raisers? And finally, just how smart are they?There are essentially three different types of ‘smart’ motorway, but what is common to all is that they have variable speed limits, indicated by overhead gantries. According to the Highways Agency, having variable speed limits helps traffic flow more smoothly, thereby enabling quicker journey times.The differences between the three types of smart motorway revolves around the hard shoulder.On a ‘controlled motorway’, there are three or more lanes and a permanent hard shoulder — just as there is on a normal motorway.Meanwhile, on a ‘dynamic hard shoulder’ motorway, the hard shoulder is semi-permanent and used as a lane during busy times of the day.Finally, there is the ‘all lane running’ option, in which there is no hard shoulder at all. Instead, there are occasional ‘refuge areas’. In total, there are some 100 miles of ‘all lane running’ smart motorway — known as ALR for short — and a further 225 miles are planned by 2025.Overall costs are hard to establish, but the most reliable estimates run to about £6 billion spent so far, with the final estimated total being £20 billion, perhaps more.And what are we getting for our money? Well, we get lots of people in control rooms all over the country watching the traffic and then deciding whether to activate the variable speed limits or to ‘turn’ the hard shoulder on or off. But is this making the traffic run more quickly, and — vitally — more safely? According to the Highways Agency, it does.          Tracey Crouch is part of an all-party group of MPs  backing campaigners who maintain that the absence of a hard shoulder puts motorists and recovery workers at riskJourney ‘reliability’, it is claimed, is improved by 22 per cent, personal injury accidents are reduced by more than half, and where accidents do occur, severity has been much lower overall.Furthermore, as the Agency estimates that congestion on the motorway and major road network in England costs the UK economy £2 billion every year, with 25 per cent of this resulting from various incidents, the smart motorways could end up saving more money than they cost.Impressive, yes. But what these figures don’t factor in are the absurd number of delays and the huge congestion caused by converting normal motorways into ‘smart motorways’.As someone who regularly uses the M3, I am well aware of how many hours I’ve wasted in traffic jams caused by years and years of roadworks that appear to have done very little apart from turn a hard shoulder into an extra lane.In addition, like many other motorists, I’m not convinced that the variable speed limits improve my journey times. Too often there is no apparent logic to their use. Frequently, I find myself being told to crawl along a near-empty motorway at 40 mph.According to campaigners, this is what happens when controllers are slaves to computer modelling and algorithms, rather than allowing the common sense of most drivers to find their own appropriate speeds.Of course, the temptation to break an unnecessary speed limit is immense, and herein lies another problem: I can get fined for travelling at 45 mph on a nearly empty motorway.This has prompted critics to question whether smart motorways are, in fact, just another cunning form of revenue-raiser rather than genuine traffic management solutions.In the four years from 2013 to 2017, 210,538 motorists were caught by cameras enforcing variable speed limits on smart motorways, and fined a total of £21 million.Although that figure is a drop in the ocean of the billions spent on smart motorways, being fined for travelling below the normal motorway speed limit because an algorithm orders you to do so must really stick in the craw.Finally, do smart motorways really make traffic run faster overall? Some think not. One 16-mile ‘smart’ ALR section of the M25, for example, recorded journey times that were, in fact, eight per cent longer during peak periods than before.And there is a dearth of statistics to support the notion that journeys on smart motorways are any quicker being, merely just 22 per cent more ‘reliable’, whatever that means.There are some who argue that motorways will not truly be smart until roads are embedded with wi-fi-enabled sensors and cables that can communicate with cars and control centres, and immediately warn drivers directly or via gantries if there has been an accident, tailbacks or other incidents, and alert them to lane closures via ‘glow-in-the dark’ road markings.Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, in which all our — possibly driverless — cars effectively ‘talk’ to each other is another way in which our roads could be made a lot more smart, as vehicles will be able to warn those travelling far behind that there has been a problem.But while some countries — the U.S. and the Netherlands — are already introducing some of these innovations, they remain decades away and will doubtless be cripplingly expensive and involve more disruption and tailbacks in order to install them.Highways England are, of course, defensive of their smart motorways and claim they’re performing better than conventional ones.‘Evidence proves they are as safe as traditional motorways, which are already among the safest roads in the world,’ a Highways England spokesman said yesterday.I am not convinced. With fears about safety and doubts about supposed improvements, it really does look as though the roll-out of smart motorways should be stopped.Smart motorways, it seems, are actually just a bit thick."},{"url":null,"title":"Maroon 5 takes stage perform half time Super Bowl LIII","story":"     Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 53 football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots          A shirtless Adam Levine ended the show with Maroon 5\u0027s hit Moves Like Jagger           Levine took off his tank top as he finished off the performance with a bang  Adam showed off his tattooed torso          Adam seemed to be in impressive shape          Adam and crew ended their performance with Moves Like JaggerImmediately following the performance, Levine took to Instagram to post a photo of the message with a lengthy caption: \u0027When we accepted the responsibility to perform at the SBHTS, I took out my pen and just wrote.

Prince Charles has a digester at Poundbury, his new town near Dorchester, DorsetPrince Charles has a digester at Poundbury, his new town near Dorchester, Dorset, which pumps gas and electricity into the national grid network to power homes and businesses. And the Queen plans to install a digester at Buckingham Palace to convert food waste, such as leftovers from banquets, into power for the royal residence.However, the Vegan Society said: ‘Electricity generated from animal products may be green but it cannot be vegan.’Robbie Lockie, co-founder of Plant Based News, a website for vegan campaigners, agreed that energy generated in this way could never be compatible with veganism.‘Farm animals generate vast amounts of methane, nitrous oxide and CO2 – all causes of global warming. We have a moral imperative to reduce our carbon footprint. Vegan energy is a way of doing that,’ he told the Sunday Times.‘Vegans should be told how their electricity is created so they can make an informed decision.’Two years ago, the Daily Mail revealed how the green energy company Good Energy was taking electricity from an anaerobic digester which was processing slurry and waste from a Somerset pig farm at the centre of cruelty allegations.Subsequently, the firm demanded an investigation and action to ensure there was no cruelty on the farm and said it ‘stood absolutely against any mistreatment of animals’.Chief executive Juliet Davenport defended taking biogas from these waste plants, saying: ‘Farms using anaerobic digestion have made a positive choice to be greener.‘Where animal slurry is used it captures harmful methane that would otherwise make its way into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digestion is a way to improve air quality and reduce global warming.’Charlotte Morton from the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association said: ‘Digestion gets the most out of waste, converting it into renewable energy and fertiliser.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Cadburys purple reign confectionery giant gives claim colour","story":"    Cadbury has given up its claim on the colour purple, opening the door for rivals to make copycat productsBudweiser goes for an adorable Dalmatian, Pepsi taps Cardi B...Bullied Miss England who suffered for years with eating...Share this articleThe case was triggered by rivals Nestle, which claimed the trademark could threaten its hazelnut and caramel chocolate called the Purple One and the Quality Street box decoration.Cadbury owner Mondelez International said: ‘We have not appealed the decision but will continue to protect what we believe is a distinctive trademark.’The company claimed a legal victory over Nestle two years ago by stopping its rival from getting a trademark for the four-finger shape of the KitKat. "},{"url":null,"title":"IKEA lease flatpack furniture businesses month","story":"Flatpack specialist Ikea is set to start leasing furniture for the first time as it tries out new ways of conducting business (pictured: Ikea store in Logan, Australia)Clegg\u0027s VERY social network: How did the ex-Lib Dem leader...Share this article    The trial will initially involve office furniture for businesses but it hopes to expand into kitchens and the consumer market (pictured: Interior view of an Ikea kitchen)Torbjourn Loof, chief executive of parent firm Inter Ikea, told the Financial Times: ‘You could say leasing is another way of financing a kitchen. \u0027It’s interesting if you as a consumer say, “I can change and adapt and modernise my kitchen if that’s a subscription model”.’Mr Loof said the leasing trial in Switzerland is part of a ‘mission’ to develop a ‘circular’ business model to re-use and turn products into new items."},{"url":null,"title":"Tickets Verdi resold 10 times face value","story":"    The demand for tickets to the Royal Opera’s production of La Forza del Destino has seen tickets on resale site Viagogo  going for more than ten times their face value.

Our writer makes a beeline to a new show inspired by their confounding paths When Charlotte Schepke, director of the London gallery Large Glass, told me she wanted to organise an exhibition inspired by my book Red Thread, it felt like the ultimate compliment. Not only because it is obviously flattering but because the book, which explores the idea of the labyrinth, is partly about translations between art forms – how a poem might prompt a sculpture, which then might slip into a story, and how this chain of influence never ends, as ideas pass from hand to hand.In the book I consider the idea of the labyrinth – the mythical, confounding prison made by Daedalus to house the Minotaur – as the original symbol of human inventiveness and imagination. I think of Daedalus as the first great artist and contriver of ingenious forms – a figure whose creations sometimes bypassed morality or overreached nature. I think of the labyrinth as a structure that, when viewed from above, with its coiled and snaking form, resembles the brain. It is fitting that one of the photographs the Irish artist Dorothy Cross is showing in the exhibition is an image of brain coral – which simultaneously resembles the interlocking passages of a maze and the grooves of a human brain. Another work by Cross contains two skulls, halved, their hollow insides gilded. The gold picks out tributaries and rivulets of bone, which make their own little confounding maze of lines.For the exhibition, titled In the Labyrinth, Schepke has invited seven artists to make new work or select recent work suggested by the theme. Only one, Mark Wallinger, actually appears in Red Thread I like the notion that the exhibition is an expansion rather than an adaptation, a new journey for the idea to travel on, prompted by fresh conversations and different eyes.Wallinger will show two of his labyrinth plaques originally conceived for the London Underground. Each of London’s 270 tube stations has one of these plaques, and each labyrinth is slightly different. The designs recall, in their circular form, Frank Pick’s classic London Transport roundel and they are made by the same firm that produces the network’s enamel signage.They act as a reminder of the vermicular tangle of tunnels that makes up the Underground, the disorienting nature of the city and the looping daily journeys of the city’s inhabitants. Because the signs are unexplained, unlabelled – and perhaps because they do not look like “art” – they have a slightly esoteric air to them, as if they are conveying some secret message. I always snap Wallinger’s tube labyrinths on my phone when I see them, though I’m a long way from collecting a full set.Helen Mirra, who is based in California, is an artist deeply interested in the possibilities of walking and weaving, both of which are activities closely related to the idea of the labyrinth – the labyrinth must, after all, be travelled on foot and navigated, if you are lucky, with the help of a thread. Her new work for the show is a woven cloth depicting a labyrinth pattern – her chosen form echoes that of a graffito, made in about 1200 BC, on the back of a clay tablet in Pylos, Greece.The story of Minos, Ariadne and Theseus has antique origins, and fragments of it appear in Homer. But the first telling of the story that brings all its now recognisable elements together comes many centuries after the Pylos graffito, in a poem by the Roman poet Catullus from the first century BC. He tells how king Minos of Crete commissioned Daedalus to build a labyrinth to house the half-man, half-bull Minotaur how Minos demanded that young men and women from Athens should be let loose in it to be killed by the creature how one year Theseus was among those chosen to be the human tribute how Ariadne, Minos’s daughter, fell in love with the prince, and gave him a sword to kill the Minotaur and a thread to find his way out. And how, in the end, Theseus betrayed Ariadne, and abandoned her on the island of Naxos.In the poem, however, this tale is told as a story within a story: the narrative unfolds as a description of a series of scenes embroidered on a precious textile, a coverlet for a marriage bed. But reading it, you become immersed in the story, forgetting that it’s made up of threads until the poet deftly reminds you. (And of course it’s not, not really – it’s made up of words, which are themselves mere inky flourishes on the page.) It’s entirely appropriate that Mirra is, in some way, travelling that journey in reverse, returning text to textile.Threads are also lines, and we make lines, or loops, when we walk. Mirra’s interest in walking puts me in mind of another great Californian walker, the writer and activist Rebecca Solnit, who once wrote about how the labyrinth “winds up a path like thread on a spool”. The labyrinth compresses a walk, it condenses a line. The walk one takes through a labyrinth is an unnecessarily long one, as the path veers away from its goal and doubles up and tangles itself up like a ball of wool. Weaving is an act of compression in its own way, too, a looping path taken by threads that would make a long line (or an unnavigable tangle) if unravelled.A work in the show deeply involved in this idea of compression is Alice Channer’s raffishly titled sculpture, Elon Musk. It consists of tightly pleated lamé material packed into a flattish metal structure designed to be fitted low down on a wall, jutting out from it like a bracket. The sculpture is meant to recall bracket fungi, those mycological wonders that protrude shelf–like from the trunks of trees.Indeed, the folds of fabric, prepared specially for Channer by a firm that pleats material for the fashion industry, resemble the gills of a mushroom (and it’s a nice coincidence, an unlooked-for connection, that the natural dyes Mirra has used for her weaving come from fungi). At the centre of the intestinal, coiling mass of fabric sits an ammonite, another form, this time ancient and natural rather than new and hi-tech, that spirals and winds.The pleated, concentrated fabric has an association, for Channer, of the way a “computer hard drive condenses and contains a huge amount of information”. As for the work’s title, she regards it as deliberately “outrageous and mischievous” to name her modest sculpture after a tech entrepreneur who is an “overblown masculine ego in freefall”. Musk, with his dreams of commercial space travel, is a damaged Daedalus for our times, perhaps or maybe an Icarus, tumbling out of the sky having tried to fly too close to the sun.I’m looking forward to seeing what the other artists – Alison Turnbull, Carey Young and Tonico Lemos Auad – bring to the exhibition, what associations the idea of the labyrinth has prompted in them. Some of the connections made will be, I imagine, clear some more intuitive and less immediately apparent. I shall enjoy the challenge of trying to map the journeys their minds have travelled. In Chaucer, and other writers of Middle English, Ariadne’s ball of thread is called a clewe.It’s a word that comes from the Old English cliewen, which means a sphere, a ball, or a skein of thread. In time this old Germanic word entirely lost its material significance and became our word “clue”. (Except, funnily enough, in Dutch, in which the word kluwen can still mean “tangle”.) It means that every time we untangle a mystery, or unravel a complicated chain of associations, we are being helped by Ariadne’s thread. I shall follow it, wherever it leads, in this new labyrinth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79a3c31f85912197679da1b76072b1613a6a3936/0_168_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c79d0b5489bfe9dcc618c015e21f5fa","title":"people of the whale a portrait of traditional hunting in alaska","story":"Photojournalist Kiliii Yuyan documents the Iñupiaq and their successful conservation practices using indigenous knowledgePeople of the Whale is the story of an Iñupiaq whaling crew, living where the vast plain of ice meets the waters of the Arctic Ocean. For the last 2,000 years, the Iñupiaq have stood on the edge of the sea ice, waiting for the migration of bowhead whales.Out on the sea ice, the Iñupiaq wait for the whale. When a whale passes near the edge of the ice, the experienced crew, paddles over Arctic waters in an umiaq, or skinboat, to catch it. The ice hides its dangers – desperate polar bears hunting humans, massive icequakes when sheets of ice collide.Bowhead whaling is a cultural cornerstone of Iñupiaq identity and a primary source of food on Alaska’s North Slope, where the cost of living is nearly three times that of the lower 48 US states.In this part of Alaska, the government allows co-management of wildlife with Native communities.In 1977, the Alaskan Iñupiaq won the right to maintain their traditional hunt of bowhead whales and manage the population. By 2011, the Iñupiaq had quadrupled the population of the bowhead, while hunting them for subsistence. The story of the Iñupiaq is a vision of successful conservation using indigenous knowledge.I spent four years living on the Arctic sea ice with the Iñupiaq, sharing the watch for polar bears and eating fermented walrus.

The only sound came from the camera crews gathered at its gates in the morning chill.Just hours earlier, the Japanese carmaker confirmed it was abandoning plans to build a new model of one of its flagship vehicles at the plant. At the Hylton Riverside shopping centre, just a few miles away, locals say there had been an inevitability to the announcement.On this morning, the shopping centre, which itself relies on trade from the Nissan workers, was quieter than usual. Those that the  spoke to say they had been preparing for “bad news” – they say a sense of resignation had gripped the Tyne and Wear city in recent months.Retired firefighter Vincent O’Neill, 55, was one of those who voted to leave. He says he now regrets his decision. His fears are about the knock-on effect on the hundreds of local businesses that rely on Nissan. “It isn’t just Nissan, it’s all the jobs in the area. As soon as one big company leaves, the rest will follow. They will all fall like dominoes,” he says.He adds: “It’s all to do with Brexit. The firms don’t want to have to pay the tariffs for imports.“If I had known then what I know now I wouldn’t have voted that way. All the promises that were made have not come true. I think a lot of people in Sunderland latched on to the ‘they’ve come to take our jobs’ argument. It would be a lot easier if we didn’t leave now.”But Bob Hackett, 66, who worked as a trainee assessor at Gateshead College arranging placements for students at Nissan and whose nephew works there, was sceptical about the Brexit connection.“I don’t think people will lose their jobs,” he says. “In my opinion it was on the cards to start with. It’s just scaremongering. I think they’re hedging their bets and waiting to find out about tariffs. They are just playing it out. I think Nissan will do anything to get more money from the government.“They keep a lot of people around here in employment. It’s so central to the area that the government will probably subsidise any tariffs Nissan should be subjected to.”A current employee at Nissan who did not want to be named says: “I think all of this was coming anyway.“We weren’t going to produce the X-Trail. The money for a new model was never released. They’re just using Brexit as an excuse. I don’t think leaving the EU will even make a difference.”Nonetheless, John Metcalfe, a 72-year-old pensioner who voted to remain, says the news has had a devastating impact on the area. “It’s a massive shock,” he says. “It’s really scary for the workers. Most of the people at Nissan voted to leave the EU and I can’t think why. I was so surprised when I saw Sunderland had voted out of the EU.“With all the taxes and tariffs that will be imposed because of Brexit, people are going to lose jobs and we need jobs up here. There aren’t any other major employers. I really worry about the future of this city.”Charity worker Katie Hopper, 26, talks of her frustration at those people in her city who voted to leave. She says: “I think Brexit is going to ruin Sunderland. It makes no sense that people of Sunderland and this workforce voted to leave the EU.”The news has caused many to view the future with trepidation. One of those was Keith Scott, 35, a father of two young children, who has many close friends and family who work at the plant.“I think it was obvious this was going to happen and of course it’s to do with Brexit. I have no idea why people voted to leave the EU,” he says.“I know Nissan had the assurances from the government but obviously that wasn’t enough.“Things like this are going to continue to happen until Nissan in Sunderland disappears completely, which will be devastating for the area. I dread to think of the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5de8c666b5454713a59a5dc15753fb0a63778a7/20_205_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a1bdab8bc690433ce5695c7d0f97dc","title":"hermes to offer gig economy drivers better rights under union deal","story":"Agreement with GMB is a first for the UK and allows for holiday pay and minimum wageThe courier company Hermes is to offer drivers guaranteed minimum wages and holiday pay in the first UK deal to provide trade union recognition for gig economy workers.Under the agreement with the GMB union, Hermes’ 15,000 drivers will continue to be self-employed but can opt into contracts with better rights.The deal comes after almost 200 Hermes couriers won the right to be recognised as “workers” at an employment tribunal last summer in a case backed by the GMB.Under employment law, “workers” are guaranteed rights including holiday pay, the legal minimum wage, minimum rest breaks and protection against unlawful discrimination. Similar cases have been brought against Uber, Addison Lee, CitySprint, Excel and eCourier.Ed Cross, a Hermes driver who has worker status after taking part in the tribunal case, said it would be better if all his fellow drivers had won the same status but he was happy they could now enjoy similar rights without having to go to a tribunal.“It’s a start but it’s not the end,” he said. “It is the dawning of a new era where drivers and Hermes have to work together in partnership.”As a result of the deal, Hermes has dropped plans for an appeal against the tribunal ruling and the GMB will not be pursuing further tribunal cases.Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB, said: “As a result of our ground-breaking agreement, couriers will have a real voice in their workplace as well as the right to holiday pay and guaranteed pay, something GMB Union has long been campaigning for on behalf of our members.“Full credit to Hermes. They’re showing that the gig economy doesn’t have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this ground-breaking agreement.“Other employers should take notice this is how it’s done.”Martijn de Lange, the chief executive of Hermes in the UK, said: “We’re proud to be leading the way with this pioneering development, which we hope will encourage other companies to reflect on the employment models they use. We have listened to our couriers and are wholeheartedly committed to offering innovative ways of working to meet people’s differing needs.”Couriers who wish to retain their current form of self-employed status with Hermes do not have to sign the new terms, although the company has indicated that they may receive higher hourly pay anyway. However, they will not receive a guaranteed minimum wage or holiday pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9013a81106f3318a31f240aa393d029935409f/0_258_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b065ee148f25332dc7c72d40a71cc65","title":"brexit united tory party stockpiling conservatives europe","story":"Loyalty is traditionally the ‘secret weapon’ of the Conservatives. But never when it comes to EuropeLet us take a stroll down the shabby corridors of Conservative history: it is June 1997, and the party leadership vacated by John Major after New Labour’s landslide is being contested, in the second round of the race, by William Hague, John Redwood and Kenneth Clarke.In a desperate bid to see off Hague, the arch-Europhile Clarke and the arch-Eurosceptic Redwood form a pact, founded on the principle that Europe will be an open issue in the party and that Tory MPs will not be bound by a strict party policy. There is much talk of a historic breakthrough, an end to the long Conservative civil war over Britain’s relationship with the EU, and a new era of internal party unity. But even those responsible for this brief alliance know it is nonsense on stilts. In his memoirs, Clarke jovially describes it as a “last desperate idea”, quickly condemned by MPs on both sides of the ide as a “Nazi-Soviet agreement”.Since Tuesday’s votes in the Commons on Brexit, it has become increasingly orthodox to suggest that Theresa May has pulled off something potentially remarkable. The argument runs something like this: yes, the broad consensus within the Conservative party in favour of Sir Graham Brady’s amendment is a fledgling phenomenon, and one that must be tended assiduously by the PM and her allies. But – it is claimed – she can now “fake it to make it”, preserving this parliamentary holding-position for just long enough, securing just enough concessions from Brussels to replace the Irish border “backstop” with the “alternative arrangements” demanded by the Brady amendment.With less than eight weeks to go until our scheduled departure date, the thesis concludes, she has a more than decent chance of coaxing her fractious party over the finishing line.Though the PM, very unusually, invoked Jeremy Corbyn’s support – “he also believes the potential indefinite nature of the backstop is an issue that needs to be addressed with Brussels” – she knows full well that she cannot depend on votes from Labour. This is a party committed to Britain’s continued membership of the EU customs union, rattled by poor opinion poll performance and distracted by fresh talk of a breakaway group of centre-left MPs.Last week, therefore, she effectively encouraged her MPs to vote against a deal that she had previously said could not be amended. Her relationship with the Tory party is now entirely Faustian. Her MPs own her political soul she now depends upon them delivering the goods.It is true that every new horror story about the likely reality of a no-deal exit focuses Tory minds. Do they really want ownership of a social, civil and economic disaster that will make the winter of discontent look like a single pothole on a remote country lane? I understand why it is assumed that basic electoral terror might force just enough Tory MPs to hold their noses and vote for the deal. But this is why the Clarke-Redwood pact is such an instructive parable. Lord Kilmuir’s famous dictum that “loyalty is the Tories’ secret weapon”, if it were ever true, requires an indelible subclause: “except in the case of Europe”.So many Conservative leaders before May have tried and failed to broker a lasting truce. Major was elected by the Thatcherite right, and trimmed on Europe, but was destroyed by the European exchange rate mechanism and the rows over the Maastricht treaty.In 2004, Michael Howard went to Berlin in a spirit of newfound comity: “You are understandably sick of constant British vetoes. And shall I tell you something? So am I.” Two years later, David Cameron instructed his party to stop “banging on about Europe”. But to no avail. In 2016 he was driven from No 10 by the referendum he had felt compelled to call after an awful lot of “banging on”.I agree with Lord Finkelstein’s observation, when he was working for Hague, that the problem with Eurosceptics is that they won’t take “yes” for an answer. On Sunday, Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, and one of the brokers of the so-called Malthouse compromise with Tory remainers, was already warning of “trouble ahead”.The pressure cooker of the coming weeks will test to destruction the cosmetic unity achieved on Tuesday. There is simply no reason to assume that the final phase of Brexit preparation will be governed by reason, measured calculation and an outbreak of common sense.Why? Because these are the not the dominant forces in the Tory relationship with Europe. Last week’s votes kicked the idea of a people’s vote into touch – at least for now. Which means that the choice confronting us now is between whatever new deal May can cobble together and no deal at all.To put it starkly: if your hopes of an orderly exit from the EU truly depend upon Conservative unity, then it’s time to start stockpiling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4338b4782e861fcd6c062cedb57350576947a7/0_86_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d68028d6042edd11434d8a16b712585b","title":"veganuary vegan food farming","story":"We know the world is eating too much meat, and we know that we as iniduals have to do something about it. So I was one of the record 250,000 people who signed up to Veganuary this year.I haven’t actually eaten meat for 30 years, although I occasionally ate fish and felt bad about it. Two years ago, I visited a modern British dairy farm where the cows were kept in very clean conditions, indoors, all year round. I hated it. So I switched to oat milk, and last year gave up eating cheese. But there’s still plenty of animal products in cakes and biscuits. And so, until 1 January, I wasn’t vegan.I’ve learned a lot over the last month. Years ago, I was accidentally given a vegan meal on an aircraft and it was terrible. But I’ve found it a complete untruth that vegan food is tasteless. I’ve discovered so many new flavoursome foods: vegan pies, tofu sausages and some fantastic chocolate. Vegan cheese might not satisfy a cheese connoisseur, but it’s fine for a decent cheese sandwich.I’ve also learned that our food labelling is extremely poor. Some foods labelled “vegetarian” are actually vegan, and many vegan foods are not labelled at all. Without Google, I would’ve been hopelessly lost – I’d check a brand and find the answer on a website somewhere. Perhaps a third of biscuits are vegan, but you wouldn’t know it. Original Hobnobs are vegan but some Digestives aren’t. Manufacturers are missing a trick.So are snack food outlets. The likes of Pret, Costa and Eat all have vegan food, but try finding it when rushing through a crowded station cafe.One of the triumphs of Veganuary is that I repeatedly tried to buy a Greggs vegan sausage roll and failed every time. While I was working in Bristol, I rang six branches of Greggs and all of them had sold out. There’s a huge appetite for vegan food, and restaurants and pubs are getting the message. I was surprised by how many are suddenly offering vegan menus – in Veganuary, at least. Chasing the vegan pound is increasingly smart business.Which brings me to farmers. Will our changing diets put farmers out of business? The downside of my Veganuary was that I received a vicious backlash on social media from some meat producers. Several farmers made good critical points about me eating processed vegan food that has been flown around the world. I bought vegan food wrapped in plastic. Some vegan food is industrially farmed. Some vegan food contains palm oil. If we want to eat ethically, it takes a lot of research.Ethical, environmentally friendly eating is a far more complex issue than just becoming vegan. If Britain switched instantaneously to a plant-based diet and we ripped out all the pastures and flower-rich meadows and hedgerows, and planted maize and sprayed crops with chemicals, it would be an ecological disaster.But we’ve got to help farmers move towards higher animal welfare and environmental standards. Put simply: we have to create a distinction between good and bad farmers. During Veganuary, I was contacted by some farmers who are producing higher quality, less intensively reared, high-welfare meat to sell at a premium. I visited one organic farmer friend. He fears that meat-eaters will forsake his produce for industrially farmed meat from supermarkets, and that good farmers will go out of business. Labels on meat and dairy products showing the conditions in which the animals are reared – like those graphic warnings on cigarette packets – would help good farmers. And instead of bemoaning their lost heritage or berating me on Twitter, high-welfare, environmentally friendly farmers need to unite and develop a brand so consumers will choose their high-grade meat over factory-farmed rubbish.I am not suggesting that we all go vegan overnight. Lots of people on social media told me they would go vegan three or four days a week. That, for me, is what Veganuary was all about.But because I haven’t declared all livestock farmers are evil, and because I’m not perfect, I also received vitriol from ultra-vegans. I was called a “cow rapist”. People told me I can’t be vegan and have my dog, Scratchy. The intolerance of ultra-vegans is so off-putting. You’re never going to win an argument by insulting and belittling people. A small minority make a lot of nasty noise.Three days into February, I haven’t eaten anything non-vegan yet. I’m staying vegan. But I’m not listening to the ultras and I’ll draw my own lines in the sand. I don’t see a problem with eating locally produced honey, for instance. I’m not going to take Scratchy outside and shoot him. I’m not about to burn my leather belts and shoes. To do so would be a waste of resources and just leads to the thing we’re trying to avoid – more consumption. But when my leather shoes wear out, I’ll seek a “vegan” alternative. And I’m definitely going to continue devouring tofu sausages, vegan pies and that amazing chocolate.• Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/334cfa3b2ce3ce815b343519d98b61954483eb42/0_11_4759_2857/master/4759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf6afba99e37c1fa9da758ba77b7f45","title":"how i fell in love with microdisney","story":"I will see the band back home in Cork for their last concert ever. If it’s a time to take stock for them, it is for me tooTo cross the planet once to see a band is indulgent. Twice might be a bit mad.Last June I flew from Sydney to Dublin to see Microdisney play their first gig in 30 years. Now I’m going from Sydney to Cork to see their final ever gig.My love affair with Microdisney began as the band ended. On 1 July 1988 they supported David Bowie at the Dominion Theatre in London, then split up days later. I was not there. I was in the Pyrenean microstate of Andorra, having gone there on a day trip from a package holiday in Spain.Andorra is beautiful, but I was concerned with taking advantage of its duty-free status. I bought 200 cigarettes, a bottle of tequila and a bunch of albums. One of those was Crooked Mile by Microdisney, which I found in a bargain bin for the peseta equivalent of 80 pence. All I knew about Microdisney was they were Irish and lived in London – and 80 pence was a risk worth taking.The mass smoking of duty-free cigarettes hastened my quitting. The tequila gave me a two-day hangover. But I still play Crooked Mile, 31 years later.It starts with the should-have-been-massive single Town to Town. When, 40 seconds in, I heard Cathal Coughlan sing “She’s trying to pronounce my name”, I was ready to proclaim their genius. As a Pádraig, I felt his pain. Despite being playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and legendary songwriter Mickie Most saying it was “one of the greatest pop singles of the last 15 years”, it failed to chart.The next song, Angels, sounds like a Steely Dan classic. Then comes Our Children, which wouldn’t have been out of place on an early 1960s Ray Charles album. Three songs in and they’d gone from pop to classic rock to country-soul – I already had my 80 pence worth. And, as I soon discovered, it’s not even their best album. That would be 1985’s The Clock Comes Down the Stairs – a novel of Irish emigrant life and Catholic guilt distilled into a 43-minute record that reduces me to tears every time I play it.Coughlan’s acerbic lyrics mixed with the pop classicism of guitarist Sean O’Hagan led BBC’s John Peel to call Microdisney “an iron fist in velvet glove”. But even Peel’s imprimatur did not lead to record sales, and they were gone before I truly knew them.Over the following decades I bought the other Microdisney records, solo albums by Coughlan and O’Hagan and those they did with their respective groups the Fatima Mansions and the High Llamas. I saw Fatima Mansions live twice and the High Llamas once, and they were great shows. But I never thought I’d get to see Microdisney play.And then, in 2017 came the brilliant Iron Fist in Velvet Glove radio documentary about the band, followed soon after by the announcement they’d play shows in Dublin and London in June 2018. Coughlan and O’Hagan were going to be joined by Jon Fell on bass and Tom Fenner on drums from the last line-up of the band, plus another guitarist, a keyboard player and backing vocalist.The night before the Dublin show, they played a rehearsal gig in front of about 150 people. I managed to get a ticket. My expectations were sky high, but nothing could have prepared me for the power and majesty of seeing them metres in front of me. I had an ear-to-ear grin for the entire set. It really felt like something close to heaven.Afterwards, the band mixed with the audience in the venue bar. I said to O’Hagan that as I’d travelled from Sydney I reckoned I’d come the furthest. He then introduced me to his sisters, one of whom had travelled from Canberra and the other from Brisbane. Later, in a bar across the road, I walked into Coughlan posing for someone’s selfie and chatted briefly with him about how much Ireland had changed for the better. He was intense. I’d have been disappointed if he wasn’t.And now it’s about to end again, and Microdisney are bringing it all back home to Cork, where it began almost 40 years ago. If it’s a time to take stock for the band, it is for me too. I’ve rarely returned to Cork since I left there in December 1991. It’s a city full of great memories, but also ghosts and regrets.I’m both looking forward to and dreading introducing myself to people I recognise from nearly 30 years ago by saying “I used to have long hair. And a lower BMI.”Not only am I now old enough to see one of my favourite bands reform, I’m also old enough to see them break up again. But at least I’ll be there this time, not on a bus from Andorra to Salou."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1708c11b626446358b0ea5fe59c04e6aef662d/0_357_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03854c58eb70f40e8b1a4ab3fba47dad","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

But they all reported “shocking” accounts of their career experiences, with two having to take legal action after bullying.The women, of black Caribbean, black African or other black backgrounds, reported being systematically overlooked for promotion, mistaken for clerical staff or shut out of participation in university activities.One professor related how even contributing to departmental meetings was made humiliating: “I had my hand up for about half an hour,” she said. “The debate was going on and I just kept it up and everybody was looking at him and eventually everyone was looking at him, looking at me.”Rollock said the women felt they received little support from their white female peers, whom they said tended to side with their male counterparts. One woman told her: “I don’t understand why everything has to be a battle and I know that it’s because I’m a black woman.”Another said that even promotion did not solve the barriers she faced: “Actually it’s a really greasy, slippery pole and so you go higher up and you think: ‘Oh, life will be better.’ It just gets worse, actually.”Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at the University of Birmingham, said her research showed universities gave greater priority to tackling gender inequality than racial inequality.She said: “In my research I found when people complained about racism at universities, it was often dismissed as a clash of personalities. When I give talks on this, I’m often asked: ‘How do you know it’s racism?’ I’m never asked: ‘How do you know it’s sexism?’”The report, published by the University and College Union, recommends that universities be more transparent about the promotion process to professorial positions, while Rollock says the practice of heads of department being able to veto internal job applications should end.The union said universities needed to overhaul their promotion structures to ensure “genuine equality of opportunity”.The report also recommends that universities have dedicated initiatives for black female academics, to provide financial stability and career support from postgraduate study through to the early stages of their academic career.It calls on universities to acknowledge the extra effort made by black academics in supporting black students and staff. “Where such work is carried out, black academics should be explicitly recognised and rewarded for such contributions as part of promotion considerations,” it says.Matt Waddup, the UCU’s head of policy, said: “This report tells of a higher education system that is plagued by bullying and stereotyping, and forces black women to develop strategies just to cope. They don’t feel they can be themselves, yet also feel forced into the role of stereotype and role model.“We need to look at how to transform a system that black female professors say is riddled with unfairness and bias. That starts with an overhaul of promotion structures to ensure genuine equality of opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c39085a53716eef5ebef1859cf8eed7acdb995/0_69_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=522a2459d191bb3d01b573d2ac4c6158","title":"fate of uks nuclear power stations in doubt over ageing infrastructure","story":"A temporary closure of two of the country’s eight nuclear plants resulted in a double-digit drop in nuclear generation in January, compared to the same period last year. Prospects for new nuclear projects have commanded headlines and government attention in recent weeks, with Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping their plans for major new plants.But the fate of the existing plants, which usually provide about a fifth of the UK’s electricity supplies, has been pulled into focus by outages due to safety checks and engineering works running over schedule. Nuclear outages also push up carbon emissions because any capacity shortfall will typically be replaced by fossil fuel power stations.Seven of the power stations use an advanced gas reactor (AGR) design, the oldest of which is 43 years old and the youngest 30 years.Most were built with a lifetime of about 35 years in mind. All are due to be closed in the 2020s after owner EDF Energy extended their lives, but there are now fears that ageing infrastructure may reduce their output or even lead them to shut early.Iain Staffell, lecturer in sustainable energy at Imperial College, which compiled the nuclear output data, said: “Just as Toshiba and Hitachi have pulled out of building new reactors, we have one third of the existing nuclear capacity unavailable either for maintenance or because their maximum power has been reduced as they get older.“Many of our reactors were built in the late 70s, and like your typical 40-year-old they aren’t in peak physical condition any more.”Hunterston B on the west coast of Scotland is temporarily offline after inspections revealed more cracks than expected in the reactor’s graphite cores. The graphite bricks slow down the neutrons in a nuclear reaction, but over years the process changes the graphite’s structure.Reactor 3 at Hunterston has been offline for nearly a year since it powered down in March last year. EDF Energy told  last May it was “very confident” the reactor would come back online by last November, but the latest estimate is 31 April. The power station’s other reactor is due back on 31 March.However, the company will only be able to restart the plant if the nuclear regulator gives the green light for the safety case presented by EDF.The company also announced this week that it was pushing back the reopening of its Dungeness plant in Kent, due to maintenance related to pipes carrying steam from its boiler. Rather than restarting in late February, Dungeness should now come back in April.Martin Freer, head of nuclear physics at the University of Birmingham and director of the Birmingham Energy Institute, said: “It is clear they are showing their age. When they were originally built they weren’t built to operate as long as they will.”The issue is not one of safety because of tight regulation of the plants, he said, but it showed the UK’s need to get on and build new nuclear power stations.By the time Dungeness is hoped to return, another old plant, Hinkley B in Somerset, will have been taken offline for graphite inspections. Any unexpected rate of cracking found there could lead to a longer outage.Francis Livens, director at the University of Manchester’s Dalton Institute, said the struggle to green-light new nuclear projects had made the need to keep the old ones on more acute. Freer said he hoped the plants would make it to their planned closure dates rather than retiring early – Hunterston is officially meant to last until 2023 – but feared some would not. “It may just be a run of unfortunate incidents, or it might be a trend of reducing reliability,” he said. “My suspicion is not all of them will make it through to the end.”EDF said its investments meant the old plants were performing well and it had spent more than £100m over the past six years on the issue of graphite cracking. The company’s figures show generation from the company’s eight plants, including the newer one at Sizewell, growing after it bought them in 2008 before peaking in 2016 and declining since.Several of the old plants are also undergoing safety reviews by the Office for Nuclear Regulation. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool both had a periodic safety review in January, with Heysham 2 and Torness to follow next January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf12e661808a460a53e7b965e2f05323e8498adf/94_0_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b3719d01f0eaec2ae658e95c65bb2e","title":"england national parks out of reach for poorer people study","story":"Protected countryside is more than 15 miles away from almost half of the most deprived areasFrom Exmoor to Northumberland, the country’s poorest people are being denied access to England’s most beautiful countryside and missing out on the mental and physical health benefits that can result, research has found.Almost half of the country’s most socially deprived areas are more than 15 miles by road from 10 national parks and 46 areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB), according to a submission to a government review into how national assets are being managed.The worst for accessibility is an area between Leicester, Grantham, Kettering and Corby. Other places out of range include Liverpool, Nottingham, Birkenhead and South Shields. Wealthier areas such as Exeter, Bath, Oxford and Brighton are far better connected.Emma Marrington of the CPRE said: “When the most beautiful parts of England’s countryside were given national park status, or designated as AONBs, they were done so as a public good – so that everyone could enjoy the benefits that access to them can bring.“But a huge amount of people are currently missing out. Regular interaction with the natural world – fresh air, exercise, escaping the stresses and strains of urban living, just being in the great outdoors – is inextricably linked to increased levels of health and happiness.”The CPRE hopes that if more people visit national parks, public support will grow for the protection of the natural environment, which the group seeks to protect against developments such as fracking and high-volume housebuilding.Studies have suggested that living in green spaces, or even justvisiting them, can help people recover from stress and mental fatigue, can reduce blood pressure and may even accelerate healing after surgery, according to the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health at Edinburgh and Glasgow universities. But reaching theses spaces is getting harder, according to a former government advisor on accessibility to national parks.“Rural bus networks have been cut back and cut back so that a round a quarter of the population who do not have a car are denied access to national parks,” said Colin Speakman, who volunteers for DalesBus, a service operated by a community interest company that takes people from Leeds, Middlesbrough, Bradford, Lancaster and Preston to the Yorkshire Dales for about £8 return.It runs all year but is busiest in summer, when it operates 12 routes and carries up to 3,500 passengers a week.Almost half of the passengers live alone and close to a third have physical or mental health problems.“We pick up a large number of older, single people who have been widowed or live on their own and for whom a trip to a national park is a lifeline to keep them sane,” Speakman said.The service costs about £100,000 a year in subsidies. A similar service has been set up for the North York Moors. Speakman wants the government to fund a wider roll-out.“One million pounds for the 10 national parks would allow each to have a beautiful, fully integrated network from the conurbations,” he said. “It’s peanuts. Our subsidy from the national parks is £5,000.”The 10 parks receive £48.7m a year in government funding.National Parks England said enabling access to all sections of society was a challenge. Tony Gates, the chief executive of Northumberland national park, said the parks wanted to develop better transport links. It also wants to create a partnership with the NHS to make sure every child can visit a national park while at school.Gates said: “Clearly a big challenge in achieving this will be providing access to transport. National park authorities would love to see more support and investment in this area to enable us to realise the significant opportunities which national parks provide for people’s health and wellbeing.”Julian Glover, a former speechwriter for David Cameron who is leading the government’s landscape review, said that as well as turning around the decline in the natural environment of some areas it was also necessary to make sure they could “ be understood and enjoyed by all parts of a changing society”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad509d41921bef149c208b933af24230ca775ad/0_92_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21c20cef93eaf2166df8ac01750a0b1e","title":"the best of sundance film festival 2019 souvenir official secrets blinded by the light","story":"In his Observer report on the 2001 Sundance film festival, the critic Dennis Lim wrote of “an infuriating yet impressive film” that combined “the underdog empathy of Wes Anderson with the bravura of Paul Thomas Anderson”. That film was Richard Kelly’s Donnie Darko, beginning its journey to cult hit in the snowy peaks of Park City, Utah. Attending for the first time, lightheaded from the altitude, I daydreamed about finding this year’s Donnie Darko, an oddity with star-making potential.Unlike Cannes (too focused on auteurs) or Toronto (too caught up with awards potential), Sundance still feels elastic enough to accommodate genuine curios. One such this year is The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Written and directed by native San Franciscan Joe Talbot, it opens with friends Jimmie (Jimmie Fails, co-writer) and Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), two eccentric African Americans skateboarding the steep, hilly streets of San Francisco while their rapidly gentrifying city floats by.What begins as a hangout movie evolves into a stirring dissection of the fictions people perpetuate to survive as the boys end up squatting in an 18th-century mansion in a now white neighbourhood that may or may not have been built by Jimmie’s grandfather. The originality and scope of Talbot’s vision feels exciting if Sundance is about talent-tracking, he’s surely one to watch.It was a sweet moment when Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham, Bride \u0026amp Prejudice) introduced the world premiere of her new film Blinded By the Light, a Mamma Mia-style musical featuring the music of Bruce Springsteen, by asking the audience to sing along to his 1980 hit Hungry Heart (they obliged). Based on journalist Sarfraz Manzoor’s memoir, the film takes place in Luton circa 1987 against a backdrop of National Front marches and mass unemployment. Its protagonist is 16 year-old British Pakistani Javed (newcomer Viveik Kalra), a gawky aspiring writer with overprotective parents who discovers an unlikely lifeline in Springsteen’s music (“No one wins unless everyone wins,” a message Chadha uses to explain the push-pull relationship between second-generation immigrants and their parents). The film cycles through the Boss’s hits, with Javed frequently quoting his lyrics in everyday conversation with no veneer of irony. It’s a big-hearted crowdpleaser that rollicks along at an irrepressibly giddy pace, but it’s earnest to a fault those with a low tolerance for corniness will struggle, as I did, as the lyrics to Dancing in the Dark literally spin around Javed’s head, in the style of Microsoft Word Art, during a thunderstorm.I was more taken with another British film, The Souvenir – an exquisitely judged excavation of and grainy homage to director Joanna Hogg’s film-school days in 1980s London and the toxic relationship she was in at the time. Hogg casts Honor Swinton-Byrne (daughter of Tilda) as Julie, a riff on herself: shy, embarrassed about her upper-middle-class upbringing and utterly seduced by brooding, posh Anthony (a chilling and sultry Tom Burke).I was similarly impressed by Israeli-American director Alma Har’el’s tender feature-length fiction debut Honey Boy, in which Shia LaBeouf portrays a version of his own abusive father (with Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe playing present-day and 12-year-old versions of himself respectively). The script, written by LaBeouf, is refreshingly direct, and at times, wrenchingly personal, anchored by vulnerable old-soul Jupe, who gives one of the most moving child performances I’ve seen in years.Two documentaries also offered insights into the abuse of power: Ursula Macfarlane’s anticipated Harvey Weinstein film Untouchable, and Leaving Neverland (Dan Reed), a four-hour Channel 4 production about two men who were allegedly sexually abused by the superstar Michael Jackson as children. Both films harness the shattering power of testimony, giving space to survivors of sexual assault. “It’s the collateral damage – what it does to relationships,” says Hope Exiner d’Amore, who claims she was raped by Weinstein in the 1970s in Buffalo, New York. Macfarlane’s film is a glossily comprehensive recap that grants voice to some of the women who suffered at the grasping hands of the tyrannical Hollywood mogul, though it doesn’t elaborate much beyond the investigative reporting done by the New Yorker and the New York Times back in 2017. Details about Miramax, the production company Weinstein founded with his brother Bob, and its boom in the 1990s, contextualise some of the complicity from the coworkers who enabled him, but I suspect this is not the definitive telling of this story.Leaving Neverland, on the other hand, whose premiere had extra security in anticipation of protesters (in fact, there were just two), feels like incontrovertible evidence of Jackson’s crimes. The film is built around the first-hand accounts of choreographer Wade Robson and former actor James Safechuck and their families. Part one tells of the grooming, seduction and abuse that began in the late 1980s when the boys were seven and 10 respectively, in shocking and graphic detail part two focuses on the aftermath, including Jackson’s civil case in 1993 and criminal trial in 2005 and the psychological reasons why they publicly defended their abuser. The running time may seem excessive, and it’s a challenging watch, but the story and its context need space to breathe. The film is set to air as two episodes on Channel 4 and HBO in March.Political thrillers The Report (Scott Z Burns) and Official Secrets (Gavin Hood) set out to redress injustices carried out by institutions rather than iniduals, both beginning against the backdrop of George W Bush’s administration. The former is an enraging true story that zips along in spite of Burns’s dense script, telling of the “torture report” commissioned by the US Senate in 2009 to investigate the brutal “enhanced interrogation techniques”’ used by the CIA on as many as 119 detainees suspected of terrorism. Adam Driver stars as staffer Dan Jones, who spent five thankless years compiling the report under the supervision of senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), only for its publication to be repeatedly thwarted.The Report is journalistic the wry, stylish Official Secrets is about journalism itself, centring on a story broken by this newspaper. In 2004, Observer reporter Martin Bright (played here by Matt Smith) published a memo leaked by 28-year-old British GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley, suitably staid) revealing that the US’s National Security Agency had asked the UK to collect intelligence about UN security council members that could be used to pressure them into mandating the Iraq war. Gun confessed to the leak and was charged. Here, she and her story are treated with sombre respect, but the film comes alive in the newsroom scenes, played with a tongue-in-cheek edge.Animals (Sophie Hyde) and Native Son (Rashid Johnson) took their inspiration from novels rather than reportage. In the rambunctious, darkly hilarious Animals, writer Emma Jane Unsworth adapts her own bestselling novel, transplanting its setting from Manchester to Dublin and casting Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat as inseparable, permanently hungover best friends edging into their 30s. “Tragedy plus time equals comedy!” opines Shawkat’s Tyler think the sharp, brittle millennial observations of novelist Sally Rooney meets the bawdy, female anarchy of Věra Chytilová’s Daisies.Native Son, starring Moonlight’s Ashton Sanders, is a fascinating, jagged, feature debut from visual artist Johnson. It reimagines Richard Wright’s Chicago-set 1940 novel about a young black man who lands a job as a driver for an affluent white family. While the setting is updated, the plot, to its credit, remains mostly unchanged, though Sanders’s laconic, slinking presence suggests icy inner rage rather than the roiling fury that characterises protagonist Bigger Thomas on the page.Last year’s festival saw the premieres of breakout hits such as Eighth Grade, Sorry to Bother You and Leave No Trace. My guess is that, of the films I saw, people will be enthusing about Native Son and Honey Boy in the months to come. My secret wish, however, is for the fabulous The Souvenir to become Joanna Hogg’s crossover hit – though a mysterious surge of walkouts at my screening suggests there’s work to do.Worst film Justin Chon’s Ms Purple. The storytelling is all over the place in the Gook director’s latest.Best performance Noah Jupe as a young Shia LaBeouf in Honey Boy had me bawling my eyes out.Worst performance Pop star FKA twigs as a sex worker who happens to be JupeLaBeouf’s neighbour, on the other hand, made me want to tear my eyes out.Director to watch Joe Talbot (The Last Black Man in San Francisco).Best comeback It’s been six years since Joanna Hogg’s last film, Exhibition, but with The Souvenir the director returns in style.Best screenplay Emma Jane Unsworth’s Animals is even funnier than the novel it’s based on.Best short Garrett Bradley’s beautiful, brain-exploding America, which played as part of the New Frontier shorts programme, is a radical overview of black cinema, a corrective to cultural amnesia and the most original film I saw all festival.Biggest sale Mindy Kaling’s Late Night, starring Emma Thompson, was talk of the town when it sold to Amazon for £10m ($13m) after its premiere.Funniest faux pas Holliday Grainger’s Laura spilling a glass of wine on a baby’s head in Animals.Best soundtrack The Souvenir, for its understated 80s soundtrack, and, begrudgingly, Blinded by the Light’s jukebox of Bruce Springsteen hits.Most awkward newsroom moment in Official Secrets When a subeditor runs Martin Bright’s article through spellcheck, she corrects US spellings to UK English, accidentally discrediting the memo the paper ended up printing – enough to send a shiver down any writer’s spine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

On Sunday, however, attentions were on Sussex as it played host to two of the tastiest ties of the women’s FA Cup fourth round. And, on a day when half of the 16 ties fell foul of frozen and waterlogged pitches, even more eyes were focused on events down south.Wasps, one of four National League sides still left in the competition, had been handed a mouthwatering draw at home to the 14-times winners Arsenal while Hope Powell came up against Casey Stoney, to whom she handed the England captaincy in 2012, as Manchester United travelled to Crawley to face Brighton, who play home games there, 22 miles north of the Amex.United passed the fourth of five tests against Women’s Super League opposition in the earlier kick-off, before their Continental Cup semi-final match up with Arsenal on Thursday night, with the former Gunners player Lauren James the difference. The gifted 17-year-old, on as a substitute at half time for Charlie Devlin, took only five minutes to give the visiting side the lead as Jess Sigsworth’s ball from the right allowed her to side-foot in from the edge of the box. Siobhan Chamberlain, often with so little to do between the posts, then showed why, despite playing in the Championship, she is not out of contention for a spot in Phil Neville’s England squad as she ed low to her right to keep out a Danni Buet penalty after Kayleigh Green was cleared out by Amy Turner in the box.With 90 minutes on the clock James then went on a mazy run down the right, muscling off two the benign challenges before sweeping past Sophie Harris to seal the 2-0 win. But this day belonged to Wasps.The muddy field down Tinsley Lane where Oakfield FC men play was packed with an impressive 1,550 sell-out crowd, far outnumbering the 764 in the 6,134-seater up the road with the back-to-back matches taking place a 10-minute drive apart. But the player-led decision to turn down the offer of Crawley Town for use of their turf made sense – Town’s manager Gabriele Cioffi was in the stands to support the neighbouring side.The atmosphere was ample reward. The quaint ground with its two tiny stands holding no more than 60 people each was heaving. Lines of people hugged the railings round the perimeter waving yellow and black paper flags. Wasps are one of a dwindling number of sides not affiliated to a men’s club and it might have been expected that the scoreline would be painful.Instead the 4-0 victory flattered Arsenal. Crippled by injury and taking the opportunity to rest players when facing a team 33 places below them, the Gunners lacked their customary free-flowing swagger. Crawley, looking to go one better than the town’s men’s team, and having beaten QPR, Chichester and Coventry after navigating two qualifiers just to make it here, did not just make up the numbers. They were tough in the tackle and crisp in passing when they could be.“I’m immensely proud of the performance of the ladies today,” their manager, Paul Walker, said. “They came up against a top side in Arsenal but I’d be very surprised if anyone thought there was four levels of difference in those squads.”For Arsenal, it was about getting the job done before Thursday’s Continental Cup semi-final against Manchester United. And with their top scorer, Vivianne Miedema, rested, it was the captain, Kim Little, who took a hold of the game and put the visitors ahead on 20 minutes, shifting into space before shooting low past Frankie Gibbs. Then, on the stroke of half-time, the 16-year-old Ruby Grant fired into the roof of the net to double the lead. Little, Katie McCabe and Danielle van de Donk were substituted and the young Gunners went to work. Grant was their outlet and she picked up a through ball and sent it in to the bottom corner for her second before securing a hat-trick with five minutes remaining.“1,550 people came today, we sold out of tickets,” said Walker. “That’s a WSL-level crowd and it shows the excitement that has been generated across the town and I hope everyone goes away thinking we put on a spectacle today. I don’t think this will be a one-off. This club is going from strength to strength.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cc4abe27f475af47309fe5f30c94b18793ebdf8/0_172_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdf4c1af80aea743e181f2958c79e672","title":"pep guardiola manchester city form heat liverpool","story":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are back to their best after Sergio Agüero’s hat-trick secured a 3-1 win against Arsenal, with the manager admitting they did not “recognise” themselves after the defeat at Newcastle United last week.The result closes the gap behind Liverpool at the top of the table to two points, with Jürgen Klopp’s team to play their game in hand at West Ham United on Monday. Guardiola’s side bounced back from the surprise loss at St James’ Park thanks to Agüero’s treble – the 14th of his City career – after Laurent Koscielny had pulled Arsenal level in the first half.Guardiola said: “What is important is being ourselves. That’s what I want. We spoke in the last days. We didn’t recognise our team in the last game. They know it – they felt the same way. Today at least we came back.”Liverpool might have gone seven points ahead if they had beaten Leicester City last Wednesday but they could only draw, and City’s manager admitted his side must concentrate only on their own results, with a trip to Everton to come on Wednesday.Guardiola refused to be drawn regarding whether Liverpool might slip at the London Stadium. “Really I don’t know. I can’t do anything in that game, so now unfortunately we don’t have one week off. Now we rest and prepare for Goodison Park. I cannot deny we prefer West Ham to beat Liverpool, but Liverpool would prefer Arsenal to beat us. That is normal. But I don’t have influence on that. All we can do is win the next game.Defeat leaves Unai Emery’s Arsenal side in sixth place, three points from a Champions League berth. The Spaniard is unsure if they can claim a top-four finish.“After losing 3-1 it’s not easy to say that, but we know we need big help,” he said. “Our challenge now is the next week, continue to work and improve, and think how we can work and be better. Last week we won and were with Chelsea in fourth position, but we lost today, lost this position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Here are the best coping tactics for each generationTriggers“Children are really the canaries in the mineshaft of human society. They are the iniduals within our cultures that are the most sensitive to the difficulties – and stresses – that societies experience,” Tom Boyce tells me. Professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of California, he specialises in the treatment of three- to eight-year-olds. Major stressors in this age group include marital conflict, violence in the home, violence in the community, problems with parental mental health – a mum or dad who is depressed – maltreatment and disciplinary behaviours that become punitive.On top of all that, as Dominique Thompson, a former student health GP who treated clients aged 11 and up, points out: “School is a source of huge anxiety.” SATS ensure that academic pressure is felt even in primary school. “Children are naturally very wary of letting people down,” Thompson adds. Friendships, social media, and social situations are additional triggers, while teens especially struggle with identity. “The whole point of adolescence is to separate from their parents”, she says. “They are creating their new image, who they want to be, what they want to be known for. That in itself is a stressful process.”The signs“Some kids can say what is bothering them,” says Boyce, whose new book, The Orchid and the Dandelion, explores why some children struggle to survive while others thrive easily. More often, he says, parental detective work is required. There may be nightmares, night-waking, bed-wetting. Children may seek to avoid activities they would normally take pleasure in. Some may display obsessive behaviours, overuse social media, or become withdrawn.What helpsFor children who want to talk repeatedly about worries, set aside 15 minutes’ daily “worry time”. Establish that worries may be thoroughly discussed in worry time but not outside of it say, “let’s talk about that in worry time”. Thompson recommends Headspace’s kids app, which she uses with her nine-year-old. “He has two minutes’ mindfulness before bed,” she says.Deciding when to push a child and when to accede to their refusals is difficult, and can only “be based on intuition of your own infinite knowledge of your child”, Boyce says. Creativity helps. He mentions one mother of a young child who refused to get ready for school. She stuck fuzzy felt-type pieces for brushing teeth, putting on shoes, eating breakfast etc on a board and let her son choose which order to arrange these events in each day.Boyce’s key recommendations for children are: stick to routines and rituals. Engage in play. Show compassion, communicate that your love is unconditional. Honour the differences between children. All of this takes time but Boyce is fond of telling parents that there is no such thing as “quality time”. Just provide enough time of any kind together. Closeness and frank conversations can emerge out of this swathe of time, at unplanned moments such as during a journey to a football match or while doing another activity.For children who become avoidant, Thompson suggests this approach, influenced by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): “Don’t ridicule. Don’t catastrophise. Say, ‘What are you worried might happen? ... And what would happen then?... OK, we can deal with that. We’ve got plasters, a first aid kit …’” When stress and anxiety “interfere with normal life”, she says, that’s the time to see your GP.Triggers“Developmental tasks from late teens into early adulthood are about moving away from your family,” says Alex Fowke, a clinical psychologist. With independence comes the fear of rejection and humiliation. Relationships, or lack of them, cause immense stress, not least because these are busy years in terms of shaping identity. Greater fluidity around identity can bring its own challenges. Fowke mentions a former client who was fluid in gender and sexuality. “As much as they found themselves attracted to everyone, by fitting everywhere, you don’t fit anywhere,” he says. All this at a time when you might find yourself, as a student or in a first job, living away from home with strangers.Financial worries are common, although according to Thompson, who is a member of the Student Minds clinical advisory group, students tend to cite these less often than relationship and academic pressures. At exam time and during university, the atmosphere can foster a tendency towards perfectionism – the setting of impossible targets, often accompanied by self-beration, prevarication, and impostor syndrome.Social media exerts its own particular pressures and a habit of incessantly comparing with others — what Fowke describes as “compare and despair”. In addition, family stressors – orcing parents, for instance – are common. Thompson advises parents robustly to resist the temptation to look to their older children for support.The signsAt this age, stress can sometimes disguise itself in strong emotions. Thompson says that lots of young women present with tearfulness, and men with irritability and anger – punching walls or picking fights. Others may find that they are compulsively seeking reassurance. There can be a non-specific sense of dread in the back of the mind. Some may use alcohol or drugs or smart drugs to manage worries, especially those who are living away from home or in reach of a cheap student bar. “Focusing and attention become difficult,” Fowke adds, “and can result in what might look like a memory problem.” Many will choose to avoid any kind of social scenario. Some will lurk on social media in order to compare themselves with others.What helpsIf identity or legacy issues are causing stress, Fowke recommends doing some work on your values: ask yourself what you would like people to say about you at your leaving party. Retirement is a very long way off, but according to Fowke, legacy worries commonly present at this age, perhaps because the choices young people are asked to make can feel like committing to an entire career. Thinking about the bigger picture helps to adjust expectations. “Sometimes our task as iniduals is to reconcile the stuff we do for fun with the stuff that just needs to be done,” he says.For those about to embark on university life, Student Minds has free, downloadable resources. Student unions are a good starting point, while universities offer counselling and courses to tackle perfectionism, exam pressure, prevarication, and other mental health challenges ask if yours has signed up to a closed trial of Fika, an app designed to foster self-acceptance and coping skills. The website Kooth offers free online counselling, and a place to monitor your emotional wellbeing.TriggersThis is a time of huge life transition. “There is this pressure to make lifelong decisions at a really young age,” Fowke says. Social media permits endless comparisons, with others who have made the same or different decisions. “When we do social comparisons,” Fowke adds, “we typically come off worse.” Many in this age group will focus on how to have the perfect marriage and children while still making an impact at work. They might compare their lives to those of their parents at the same age. There may be a pressure to start a family. “One of the stressors tends to be: ‘I should have these things by now. I see my friends settling down. I’m not even dating anyone.’ There’s sometimes an unrealistic expectation that everything is possible,” Fowke says. For women in particular, children impact on career progression, which brings new worries.Those entering employment for the first time face a major adjustment perfectionists can suffer. “They find themselves in a situation where they are deskilled or incompetent, and it unsettles their sense of self,” explains Sally Brown, a coach and counsellor who says she sees many young, driven, outwardly successful people aged 18 to 30 who are struggling with debilitating levels of anxiety.The signs“Anxiety will leak out in whichever way that your inidual vulnerability will allow it,” says Brown. “I saw somebody recently who became very anxious about whether she had hit someone while driving. That is a form of OCD.” She also cites the compulsive overthinking of social situations. “Post-event analysis: coming home, rerunning conversations, feeling judged.”Some people find they lose the will to do tasks they were previously happy to do, from getting on the underground to speaking in meetings. They might become avoidant, while others exist in a “hypervigilant state, where you feel that something awful might happen. This sense of fear lurks around the edges. There can be a constant narrative of ‘Am I having a breakdown, will I be able to cope, will I have another panic attack?’” Brown adds.Self-criticism is “massive in this age group. Many clients “have installed an inner bully in their head, that berates them 247. We would not tolerate that kind of person in our life following us around saying that to us, but we do it to ourselves.”What helpsBrown advocates self-compassion. “It is not about letting yourself off the hook, it’s about self-acceptance.” To those who self-berate, she suggests an experiment. “For one week, treat yourself with the same kindness and acceptance that you would treat a good friend whom you love. That in itself can be transformative.” Sometimes it helps to label the self-berating voice. Brown talks about “putting the troll back in the box”.Listen carefully to your anxiety. Panic attacks are often “a sign that the brain needs to have opportunities throughout the day to come down to a state of calm,” Browns says. She recommends “a personal daily prescription for mental wellbeing”. Take five minutes with a cup of tea resist scrolling through your phone. “Check in with yourself,” she says. Ask yourself, “How do I feel, where’s my thinking going?” If your shoulders are up by your ears, let go of tension. Try 711 breathing – breathe in for a count of seven and out for 11: a longer out-breath regulates the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.Brown likes the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise as a way to ground yourself in the present: think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can smell and one you can taste. Try to resist the urge to check social media first thing in the morning. One early refusal can make a big difference to the day.Know your thinking patterns: catch yourself in the act of catastrophising or being a perfectionist, or inflexible, and name the behaviour to yourself. This helps to take anxiety out of the driving seat.Triggers“There’s real mental and physical load at this age,” says Louise Tyler, a counsellor based in Altrincham who works with many high-achieving professionals on building resilience. Financial concerns, ageing, a sense of mortality are all factors, along with what Tyler calls “an existential search for purpose. People start to become aware that life doesn’t go on for ever.” There are questions such as “Have I put enough money aside? How will I face retirement?” And all the while there’s “a need to feel constantly productive and efficient”, she says. Commonly known as the sandwich generation, many in this age group will care for both teenage children and ageing parents. Relationship breakdown, orce and loneliness can be further triggers, along with the emergence of health issues.For others, Fowke says, anxiety may be triggered by grief at not having had children. The perimenopause and menopause both cause stress, including both physical and emotional symptoms. For men, there is thought to be a similar life change called the andropause, associated with a gradual drop in testosterone. Men may develop depression, loss of sex drive and other symptoms.Waking at night, often with the mind whirring. “If you have cortisol racing through the body in the day, it will not switch off at night, Tyler warns. “Your body will ping awake.” Stress hormones can bring palpitations and nausea, a lack of energy and restlessness. Tyler finds some people develop irrational phobias that they’ve not had before – becoming fearful, for instance, of driving on the motorway. Rauch cites “unaccountable frustration and disappointment”. Anger and arguments with partners can increase.What helpsTyler says that women in the sandwich generation tend to “take on more of the emotional laundry” and arrive at her door “burnt out”. She encourages these clients to give themselves permission to switch off and suggests including regular “stop points” – ideally three times a day. What you do in this time doesn’t matter it’s the stopping that counts. Meditate, read the paper, put on music during the commute home. It’s important to “make that switch from seeing downtime as selfish”, she says. Exercise also helps by burning off adrenaline. Tyler thinks it may help to stop thinking of exercise as something you “should” do, and to see it as “a useful strategy” you choose to deploy. Counselling works for some.Triggers“Death, to be blunt,” says Martin Pollecoff, 69, a psychotherapist and chair of the United Kingdom Counsel for Psychotherapy. Friendship groups at this age may be decimated by ill health and death. As in any time of transition, the strain on relationships is immense. “It’s quite common that one partner is much better at amusing themselves,” says Celia Dodd, author of Not Fade Away: How to Thrive in Retirement. “If one partner is retired and one isn’t, the one who isn’t is very likely to say, ‘What have you been doing all day?’” This can exacerbate the sense of purposelessness. There may be conflict with grownup children, distance from grandchildren.For those who have associated stress with a busy working life, it can be hard to recognise listlessness as a sign of anxiety, while those who are new to retirement might be running on adrenaline, with nowhere to spend it, no sense of purpose.For some, Dodd observes “a kind of competitive retirement” in which there is “a new pressure on people to have a great time.” Regrets can loom large. And underlying all this is deep uncertainty about what lies ahead.The signsProcrastination, along with enlarging health worries. Many people feel reluctant to leave the house. Some feel frustration at not achieving anything in the day, or ruminate on past disappointments. “Wine o’clock starts earlier and earlier,” Dodd says. “And then just feeling uninterested in life, thinking, What’s the point in anything?”What helpsAcceptance. “Accept the things you have done, the things you will never be able to do,” Pollecoff advises. “You have to face up to the paths you didn’t take,” Dodd adds. “Think about them. Then try to think of the good things that you did instead.”Rauch, 58, is finding this age “a great period for relaunch. Our values change. We put less emphasis on ambition and more on relationships, other people, which is very rewarding.” Finding new routines helps. “Work fills up this big space in our life, and it is a question of finding new things that have value,” Dodd says. “They are really to do with people. Connecting with other people.”For those who find it hard to get out of the house, Dodd suggests making small changes. Listen to a different radio station. Go to a cafe for breakfast. Walk a different way to a familiar destination. Find a new activity that challenges you. “Comfort zone is a horrible phrase,” Dodd says, “but you’ve got to keep stretching and be prepared to be a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Then you get this fantastic sense of achievement.”Volunteering is one way to do this, although the challenge could also be planning a holiday, with a subsidiary goal of learning a language, say, or a physical challenge such as running a 5K. Try your hand at something new. And remember, “It’s OK to be crap at things,” says Pollecoff. “One of the great things about old age is that you can fail and it’s not going to destroy you.”Use newly available time to prioritise health. “Become your own doctor,” Pollecoff says. “Diet. Exercise. Put health first.” Finally, Dodd and Pollecoff both agree that “following your curiosity” is key.TriggersEach decade over 70 brings subtly different challenges, but throughout this period you may be facing the loss of a partner, or of friends, and a perceived loss of place in society. For some there is the prospect of a move into a care home, or the fear of it. For those with early stages of dementia with some insight into their condition, there may be the sense that “the locus of control is moving away from you”, explains Duncan Forsyth, a consultant geriatrician.According to Alex Bailey, a doctor in the old age faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, fear of death is not a big problem. “I’m 40 and I’m terrified of death,” he says. “But you don’t tend to see that in older people so much. People who have had a long life experience have generally come to terms with that.” Or built resilience against it. Ill health, on the other hand, does lead to anxiety, especially if the illness is a threat to independence.There may be financial worries, particularly about the cost of care. “You may not be confident in the ability of your family to steer your life. How much do you trust your kids, for example?” asks Bailey. “There can be a fear of being seen as a burden, as well as the fear of physical and mental incapacity, and of being left alone, while others may have the stress of contributing to the care of young grandchildren. Loneliness is rife. On top of that, “The messages that older people get from society are that life is less meaningful than it was.”The signsSomatising – expressing distress in physical symptoms – is common. Loss of weight and appetite are often interpreted as the result of an altered lifestyle: “Well, I don’t move around as much, so I don’t need to eat as much.” But they may be caused by stress or anxiety – a leg pain might be the result of anxiety around walking, for example. What helpsThe key, Bailey says, is to keep your social network as active as possible. “We’re social creatures. Keep at it.” Communities are full of opportunities to socialise: seek them out. Even small daily moments of interaction help, such as chatting to postmen or shopkeepers.This is a great time to take up a new hobby or physical activity – especially one that involves meeting others.Try to focus on what is causing the stress and try to set the worry to one side. “What is it that you are thinking about that stops you going to sleep. Why can’t you switch your brain off? Have you always been a worrier, a person who cogitates too much in the dark hours when you should be putting into neutral?” Forsyth asks. Try altering your breathing to slow the heart rate (by breathing out for one second more than you breathe in, for instance). “Anxiety is a pathological state. It can be helped,” Bailey says. If you have or fear early stage dementia, the National Dementia Helpline offers free advice. CBT is another option. More sessions may be needed in this age group, Bailey says.And while friends and family members may judge your decisions, it is not for them to change or make them: “If you want to make a crazy decision, that’s your right,” Bailey advises. This applies to relatives who may be trying to influence your care provision to your choice of holiday.Psychotherapy can also be beneficial in this age group. Ask your GP if the NHS’s Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) scheme is available to older people in your area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f083de8fa700c90770e945115ef74653fd8279d8/0_249_5584_3350/master/5584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=234fe1b405e362452d94d4cc1d6040db","title":"maroon 5 super bowl half time adam levine torso tedious review","story":"Maroon 5’s half-time show, aided by appearances from Travis Scott and Big Boi, was an utterly conventional rundown of the band’s biggest hitsLet’s hope you weren’t banking on Maroon 5 to salvage a surprisingly dull Super Bowl (or is it a Punt Bowl?). With an arsenal of pop hits at their disposal, the Adam Levine-led septet gave the fans at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium a pretty forgettable half-time show, with assists from Travis Scott, Outkast’s Big Boi, and a gospel choir that added some vocal heft to Levine’s sweet but thin falsetto. Perhaps that’s what the NFL wanted, what with the league’s chronic aversion to pushing the envelope, but the show brought into sharp focus the achievements of recent half-time show acts like Prince, Beyoncé and Lady Gaga who, singing and dancing in equal measure, helmed their shows all by themselves.Don’t get me wrong: I grew up on Maroon 5’s debut album Songs About Jane, a lovely collection of pop-rock earworms, and thankfully the band played beloved oldies like This Love and She Will Be Loved. But, as far as half-time performances go, the show itself was a pretty toothless, cookie-cutter affair, marked by the requisite pyrotechnics and some floating lanterns as Adam and co ran down a list of radio hits: Harder to Breathe, Sugar, Girl Like You, and Moves Like Jagger among them.During the latter track, Levine threw caution to the wind and took his shirt off, revealing his much bandied-about torso in homage to the song’s titular Rolling Stone. It was a last-ditch attempt at some gravitas after several minutes of unenthusiastic guitar-strumming and hip-gyrating, but it came over as a little lame and must have elicited an eye-roll from Janet Jackson, who was crucified for her wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl exactly 15 years ago.These days, the NFL finds itself it right in the thick of the culture wars, mired in controversy over its tepid approach to player safety (most notably the crisis of brain damage among retired players, and the NFL’s historic slow-walk on the issue) and the league’s owners’ collective blackballing of Colin Kaepernick in the wake of his decision to protest against police brutality during the national anthem two years ago. Throw in commissioner Roger Goodell’s mismanagement of about a half-dozen other controversies – Deflategate, domestic violence, and some patently racist remarks by team owners – and one can understand why merely associating with the league has, in some enclaves of the entertainment world, become verboten.Case in point: Rihanna, Cardi B, Pink, and Jay-Z all reportedly turned down the chance to helm this year’s half-time show, a few of them pointing specifically to the NFL’s treatment of Kaepernick. Travis Scott initially refused too, but agreed after the NFL agreed to donate $500,000 to Dream Corps, a social justice advocacy group focused on fighting poverty (Maroon 5 and its label Interscope donated the same amount to Big Brothers Big Sisters, a youth mentorship organization). Years ago it would have been hard to imagine anyone turning down what was once considered the biggest gig in entertainment.Maroon 5, then, were a suitable choice for a league that has taken great pains to safeguard its status as the national pastime and maintain as broad an appeal as possible. Scott’s cameo was intended to provide a jolt, and he did indeed crowd-surf after a breathless and heavily-bleeped performance of SICKO MODE and Like a Light, but the appearance was short-lived. Then came hometown favorites Sleepy Brown and Big Boi (André 3000 is too busy starring in Claire Denis films), who performed the Outkast classic The Way You Move, clad in fabulous furs, and was gone in a flash.The half-time show is a necessarily star-powered event, and so as long as the performer has about a half-dozen recognizable hits to play, disaster is almost always averted. But the bar should be higher than the staid, run-of-the-mill jaunt we got from Maroon 5. True, it’s not always rainbows and butterflies, but it didn’t have to fall this flat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f98e5c542ec2d45a630f010d7f7404abb9bc576/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afffe36ffd8c5f949142b3b195f7a74b","title":"rapper 21 savage us immigration authorities ice british","story":"The rapper 21 Savage was arrested in Atlanta early on Sunday morning by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Authorities said the musician is in fact a British national who entered the US legally in 2005 but failed to leave under the terms of a non-immigrant visa.The rapper, whose given name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was placed in removal proceedings.Ice said Abraham-Joseph was arrested as part of a “targeted operation with federal and local law enforcement partners”. Bryan Cox, Ice southern regional spokesman, confirmed the arrest to local Atlanta station WSB TV.“Mr Abraham-Joseph was taken into Ice custody as he is unlawfully present in the US and also a convicted felon,” Cox said.Abraham-Joseph has a history of gang activity and, according to an Ice statement, was convicted on felony drug charges in Fulton county, Georgia, in October 2014.

New England, seemingly impervious to age, controversy and the best efforts of their opponents have won their sixth title in 18 years, an extraordinary achievement in a league built for parity. That their 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history will matter little to their fans, or the fiercely competitive Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. Indeed, the fact that many watching at home did not appreciate the Patriots’ defensive masterclass will probably make victory sweeter for a team that thrives on the antipathy of others.Winning the coin toss turned out to be the highpoint for the Rams. They put the ball into the hands of Brady, aiming to become the first player to win six Super Bowls. He looked anything but a man who had seen it all before though – on the first pass of the game he forced a throw to Chris Hogan. It was marginally off target and ended up in the hands of Rams linebacker Cory Littleton. It was the first time in his postseason career that Brady had been intercepted on the opening pass of the game.The Rams couldn’t do anything on their ensuing possession but, in the opening stages at least, the usually ruthless Patriots looked nervous. They had called their second timeout only 10 minutes into the game, a sign that there was miscommunication between Brady and the coaches on the sidelines. The unease seemed to be spreading too – New England’s usually reliable kicker, Stephen Gostkowski, missed a 46-yard field goal shortly afterwards that would have opened the scoring.That unease may well have been down to the pressure created by the strength of the Rams’ defensive line, led by the newly crowned NFL defensive player of the year, Aaron Donald. Before the quarter was up Brady had nearly thrown another interception – dropped by Marcus Peters – and was strip-sacked by John Franklin-Myers. In a season characterised by explosive offenses, neither team had scored and Brady and Rams quarterback Jared Goff had completed fewer than half their passes.As Brady struggled, he turned to familiar targets: Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski. He ground out short passes here and there until he brought his team into field goal range and this time Gostkowski was successful from 42 yards. It wasn’t pretty but the Patriots at least had points on the board: it had taken them nearly 20 minutes to open the scoring.Goff, meanwhile, was struggling to put any passes together against the Patriots’ stifling defense. He put plenty of air on a few deep balls but they appeared to come from desperation rather than part of any coherent plan. After the game, Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower joked that Brady was getting undeserved attention. “I’m tired of hearing about Brady,” he said with a laugh. “I won one today we all got one. It feels good for us to get it all. Shout out to him getting his, but this is a team game and it feels good to win.”The Rams’ real offensive star this season, has been running back Todd Gurley but he was having similar struggles to Goff – possibly due to a lingering knee injury that he had picked up towards the end of the regular season. By the end of the first-half the entire Rams’ offense had combined for 57 yards, 36 fewer than Edelman had on his own.Brady got the ball back with three minutes left in the first half, exactly the kind of situation in which we have seen him lead his team to a touchdown at a crucial point in the game time and time again. But his throws were off – one to a wide open James White on the sidelines was particularly painful – and at least five yards off target. Still, the Patriots made it to halftime with a lead of 3-0, the fewest points scored in the first half of a Super Bowl in 44 years. More significantly, perhaps, it was the first time they had led at halftime in their last three Super Bowls. In a game that looked like it was going to be decided by fine margins and small tactical adjustments the Patriots, coached by arguably football’s most brilliant strategist of all time, held a clear advantage.The third quarter started with Gurley finally producing something of significance, jagging through the Patriots defense for 16 yards, a play that gave the Rams a glimmer of hope. It said a lot about the game that the Rams’ best player had been their punter, Johnny Hekker: by midway through the third quarter he had as many touches – eight – as Gurley.Such were the Rams’ struggles that it was easy to forget they were only 3-0 down. Goff, who had been confused by the Patriots pass rush all game, finally strung some passes together and Greg Zuerlein, one of the best kickers in the league, evened the score with a 53-yard field goal with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It was another nerveless kick from the man who had taken the Rams to the Super Bowl with a 57-yard effort in overtime in the previous game.And then, as the game wound down to its last 10 minutes Brady – perhaps inevitably – decided to win it. The 41-year-old reeled off four successive passes, the final of which was a beauty to Gronkowski – a ball threaded into the few centimeters of the field uncovered by the Rams’ defensive backs. Brady hadn’t been great for most of the game – but he was great when it mattered. Gronkowski emerged with the ball on the two-yard line and the next play Sony Michel punched the ball home from two yards. When Stephon Gilmore intercepted Goff on the next drive with four minutes left, the Patriots looked like winners. Shortly afterwards, as Gostkowski’s field goal made it 13-3, they were.“It wasn’t pretty. I’ll take any ugly win over a pretty loss,” Edelman, who was named the game’s MVP after catching 10 passes for 141 yards, said.Many hate the Patriots, but few can deny their brilliance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/070a9cdb9bf5a9cbdadc0146aa35e52a7b72b835/0_182_4211_2528/master/4211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d8fb204303ed127debd193e11358f1","title":"super bowl 2019 score live latest new england patriots los angeles rams winner tom brady","story":"Edelman is the deserving winner of the MVP award. He’s had a decent career for a player drafted 232nd in the 2009 draft.So that does it for our coverage: the Patriots, now arguably the greatest dynasty in the modern era, will enjoy yet another parade in the coming days. That’s all for our day-long coverage of Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. Be sure to check out Tom Lutz’s report from Mercedes-Benz Stadium.Here comes Vince Wilfork, then Emmitt Smith, then Joe Namath (a Jet, wow!) with the Vince Lombardi trophy, kissed by Pats players as it heads to the podium. Commissioner Roger Goodell is booed before handing the trophy to Kraft, who hoists the silverware, again.The world outside of New England shakes their collective heads. “There is one constant throughout these 18 years. Two men who are the best at what they’ve done in the history of the NFL. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. and through their hard workland great leadership, I am honored to say for the sixth time, we are all Patriots and once again we’re world champions!”“Just so proud of our team. The support here was like a home game, it could have been Gillette Stadium....”How will you motivate yourself to do this again?“Look at this, how could this not motivate you!”Mobbed by cameras and just about everybody in the dome, Brady hugs CJ Anderson of the Rams and embraces Edelman. Then Kraft enters the fray for some love as the two lock arms. CBS in the US are desperate to get that interview but it’s madness. OK, here we go. “You know it was an unbelievable year....it’s unbelievable to win this game...the Rams made it tough on every play...the defense made it hard every play.”“We’ve been this far and lost which is really tough. We had a lot of resolve the last couple of weeks. I wish we played a little biut harder on offense. I can’t believe it...Super Bowl champs.”“It doesn’t change anything. I can’t wait to spend some time with my kinds and my life...I am so happy for my teammates, this is a dream come true for all of us.”It doesn’t seem like Brady is going anywhere. The New England Patriots have won Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. It’s their sixth title in nine tries during this BradyBelichick run!Zuerlein misses from 48, and this game is all but over!Cooks has a 24-yard reception and the Rams are at the 49. Belichick puts everybody back.Cooks has a catch at the 29 and Goff spikes the ball and here comes the field goal unit. Goff is incomplete looking for Cooks, and then LA are called for holding, just to make it all that much more painful. Woods takes it up to the 26 as the clock ticks...That’s the Patriots all-time leading scorer sealing a Super Bowl title. His kickoff goes into the endzone. Here come the Rams trying to pull many rabbits out of no hats.It’s good! Barely, but it’s good! The New England Patriots are going to win the Super Bowl again!Belichick keeps the offense on the field, runs down the clock and calls a timeout. Does he kick with Gostkowski or something else? They’re gonna kick! It’s about a 41 yard attempt!Michel on third and short, and he’s short! Or is he? There’s a measurement. Yes he is! It’s fourth and inches! Michel runs right, and now it’s 3rd \u0026amp 1 at the Rams 24 as we hit the two-minute warning. Unless something bananas happens Tom Brady is going to win this thing. Michel runs for around four yards, but there is a flag. It’s two actually: a hold and an illegal use of the hands call on New England. LA refuse the penaltie. to get the down. New England are running, and who is it? Burkhead, steaming down to LA’s 33 and it’s a 26-yard gain for the lunch-pail back who has an enormous first down, and that may do it.LA call their final tiomeout. Fowler puts illegal hands to the face and it’s another first down for the Pats. That moves the ball up to the Pats 37. Michel is running again for just a few yards. Rams call timeout. They have one left. Michel is running again and this time there’s room! Lot’s of room! Right up the middle, Michel has a huge 26-yard gain! That’s not going to help LA. Both teams have a pair of timeouts. New England will start running clock. Michel runs into the line as we hear ticks...Gilmore picks off Goff! He was looking for Cooks but the pass was all wrong and the Pats have possession!Cooks had to make that catch in the end zone in the prior play! That was the moment!Goff goes endzone! He’s got Cooks and it goes in and out of his hands! That would have been a touchdown throw but Cooks botched it!Goff is money, finding Reynolds for a key third down to keep this drive alive for the Rams. They’re at the Pats 44. Now they’re inside the 30 after Goff hits Cooks on a flag play!Goff gets pressure, he’s knocked down after tossing an incomplete pass. It’s a huge 3rd \u0026amp 9 coming up here for LA. Gut check time for LA. Good start: a screen pass to Cooks turns into a big gain down the far sideline for a gain of 19 to the 44. Sony Michel is into the endzone! That’s a real live touchdown play and at a huge moment in this game. Pats in pole position as we head down the stretch in Atlanta!Big play to Gronkowski dow to the two-yard line! Great throw to the tight end and it’s first and goal to go for New England!We’re in the red zone! It’s true!Brady: a tremendous timing floater to Gronkowski to start the drive. It’s a first down on his fifth catch, this one an 18-yard reception. He answers, finding Edelman, his 10th catch for 141 yards. Quickly, New England are inside the Rams 40...It’s 3rd and 22 long yards. Goff, hands to Gurley, and he’s hit hard by Flowers for a loss! So the Rams had the ball for some time, but the drive comes to naught. Super Bowl record holding punter Hekker comes out and does what he does, what he’s been doing, a lot, kicks it, down to the Patriots 31.I’m still excited, but why?Gurley is back and running, but the center, John Sullivan, is flagged for holding. So now it’s 1st \u0026amp 20 on the Rams 33. Goff has a cut on his left hand, and now he’s HARD hit while running towards the sideline: Jonathan Jones comes about as close to a personal foul as you can get but there’s no flag!It’s 2nd \u0026amp 22 after a loss of two and the Pats fourth sack. Goff is incomplete on 2nd \u0026amp 11 and falls to the ground after pressure. Big 3rd \u0026amp 11 now for LA, and Goff fires into a green swath of turf, incomplete. There’s a flag downfield, but for what? It’s defensive holding and that turns a punt situation into a fresh set of downs, which has to drive Bill Belichick out of his skull. LA on their 27. Now they’re on the 44 as Goff hits Cooks on a curl. Nice gain, and perhaps LA will capitalize on that penalty?“If Greg the Leg kicks a field goal at the end of the fourth quarter to win the game 6-3 for the rams, could he be in with a chance of winning MVP? Not that that is going to happen. This has got Tom Brady 2 minute drill to win written all over it, hasn’t it?”Yeah, but the big bats are coming up...The Rams are on their own 22. It’s 2nd \u0026amp 7, and New England want to talk it over. The Patriots call their first timeout of the game. A false start turns a 2nd \u0026amp 1 until a 2nd \u0026amp 6. That’s clumsy. Will it matter?Anderson bounces outside but Gilmore punches the ball out of his hands! The ball is loose!Luckily for LA, it rolls out of bounds!It’s 3rd \u0026amp 2, and now Goff finds Cooks who is running to his right for an eight yard gain and a first down.Fresh set of downs for the Rams. Goff has Anderson, who takes a little nothing into a nine-yard gain on the far sideline. That was a dump that looked to be going nowhere: Goff is gaining confidence. On 3rd \u0026amp 4, Littleton breaks up a pass looking for White. Brady was rushed on the play, and there’s been a momentum shift in Atlanta!But Allen does a great job on the punt. The Rams start from their own seven. Patriots 3-3 Rams, end of 3rd quarterMichel has it again, and this time he’s wrapped up, and the whistle is blown without the back hitting the turf. And that will do it for the third quarter. Surely we’ve never completed three quarters of a Super Bowl without a touchdown, right?It’ll be second and long around midfield when we resume. On 2nd \u0026amp 9, Brady finds White who is running towards the near sideline...but there’s a flag. It’s defensive holding, which as we all know is an automatic first down. Pats have it at their 31.Now they’re at the 50! Michel runs right, finds a hole, bounces off a tackle and runs to midfield after a gain of 19! Great hard-nosed run there. New England start at their own 25. I can’t remember the last time I was excited about a third quarter field goal. Goff, from the shotgun, and he is destroyed! The Pats mob bursts up the middle, first Hightower, then Van Noy, throwing the Rams kid QB to the turf!The Rams TD drive is stalled in favor of the field goal unit.Greg “the leg” (original) is good from 53! We’re tied!How about that? I think I’m excited!Play action, and Goff goes to the endzone! Cooks has his hands on, leaping for the pill, but McCourty knocks it away just in time!And now it’s 3rd \u0026amp 7...Here come the Rams! Goff fires and connects with Woods over the middle! That’s an 18-yard gain!LA call timeout with the play clock trickling down to two seconds. When we come back, it’s 1st \u0026amp 10 at the Pats 29...On 2nd \u0026amp 7, Goff faces pressure and throws it into the arm of Anderson, except Anderson is facing the wrong way. The Rams are 0-8 on third down. It’s 3rd \u0026amp 7. Now Anderson has the fourth Rams first down of the night with a four-yard run. This counts as a drive!And wait, there’s more! Cooks has a reception on the near sideline and that’s another gain up to their own 49! Are we seeing the effects of Chung’s absence?Goff finds Reynolds on the far sideline for a gain of seven. I call that progress. Brady looks for Hogan on the far sideline, Peters is on him and breaks it up. I thought I saw a judge reaching for a flag before deciding against it. OK. Every time I write punt, you take a drink. Is it too late for that? It’s a 42-yard kick, which is very un Hekker-like. LA start at the 23. After a NE penalty pushes the Pats back, Brady connects with Edelman over the middle for eight, setting up another big third down. If the Rams win this, I’m with that! Take that Edelman!Goff has heat in the endzone and he throws it away. Hightower put Goff on his back just after the throw. And here comes Mr You Know Who, who has an incredible kick! It skids all the way down to the Pats 29, and that’s a record for Hekker: the longest punt in Super Bowl history at 65 yards!All these punts. It was all worth it, just for that moment!On 2nd \u0026amp 8 Anderson runs right for about two, up to the four-yard line. That makes it 3rd \u0026amp 6. Don’t expect anything too splashy from LA deep in their territory. Will that open anything up for Los Angeles? Stay tuned to find out, the Rams offense are on the field. Another quick pass to Edelman for a gain of about eight, setting up a 3rd \u0026amp2. Now Brady is in the shotgun: he has time, but his pass towards the far sideline and Edelman is incomplete, so LA hold a and NE will kick.Allen’s punt lands at the two and is downed! So the Rams will have a long way to go as they try to get something, anything on the scoreboard. Brady hits Edelman again in the middle of the field, and there’s room to roam for the wideout. By the time it’s over it’s a big 27-yard third down conversion up to the New England 41!Edelman cannot be stopped. Two little runs, first from Michel and then from Burkhead, set up a 3rd \u0026amp 4. It’s a big 3rd \u0026amp 5 as the Rams try to establish their offense. Goff is back to pass and throws into double coverage towards Cooks and Gilmore knocks it away. Here’s a familiar sight: the Rams punting unit. It’s Hekker’s seventh kick. New England will start at their eight yard line. Chung is up and walking under his own power but it looks like he came down wrong on his right arm and he’s heading to the lockers. Will he be back? He did not play in the second half of Super Bowl LII last season after suffering an injury. Gurely has it! He runs right, he cuts left and he has room! First down and Todd Gurley is alive for a 16-yard gain!And now he’s running again! This time for six more yards! Was this the plan all along?Now Pats safety Patrick Chung is shaken up, much to the chagrin who wears a look of concern on the sideline.

That is certainly the case with Richard Kalinoski’s play – first seen in America in 1995 and since produced in more than 20 countries – which has only four characters but is haunted by the memory of Turkey’s systematic elimination of 1.5 million Armenians. I found its portrait of an immigrant marriage deeply touching, while wishing it told us more about the Armenian genocide of the 1910s and early 1920s.Kalinoski sets the action in 1920s Milwaukee, where Aram, a young Armenian photographer who has miraculously survived the mass killings, meets his 15-year-old bride, Seta, who is a similarly orphaned refugee. Aram behaves like a traditional patriarch but Seta is too spirited and inquisitive to be a submissive consort. The marriage is also shadowed by Seta’s inability to bear children. If the relationship is saved, it is through Seta’s temporary adoption of a 12-year-old street kid, Vincent, who is in flight from persecution at a Catholic orphanage.You can’t fault the play, in Jelena Budimir’s production, as a story of a relationship. George Jovanovic as Aram has exactly the right withdrawn testiness and his eyes, as Seta observes, are “a mountain of sadness”. Zarima McDermott is highly impressive as Seta, mixing sparkiness and anxiety in just the right proportion. There is a fine moment when she counters Aram’s use of Proverbs to justify male dominance with biblical quotations asserting the exact opposite. Hayward B Morse also doubles effectively as a beneficent narrator and the boy who becomes a surrogate son.The play, however, raises nagging questions. It condemns the pursuit of Vincent by a pederastic priest while scarcely raising an eyebrow at Aram’s marriage to a 15-year-old girl. It also leaves to the end an explanation of how Aram survived the slaughter, and the reason why his cherished family photo has no faces. The play performs a public service in reminding us of the Armenian slaughter which, to this day, Turkey refuses to call a genocide. In focusing so fixedly on an intimate relationship, however, it relegates the horrors of history to a backdrop.• At the Finborough theatre, London, until 23 February.

Thank goodness the BBC have moved on from the endless procession of white presenters in ‘colourful’ foreign landsGorée island off the coast of Senegal. The largest slave trading post on the African coast for centuries and now a place of pilgrimage. Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama have both been here. In the first episode of Africa With Ade Adepitan (BBC Two), it’s the turn of the Paralympic athlete, TV presenter and all-round good egg to bear witness to this tiny speck of land that symbolises the greatest inhumanity.“Bye-bye Africa for ever,” the guide explains as Adepitan passes through the “door of no return” at the House of Slaves Museum, memorialising the final exit point for 10 million African slaves. The Yorùbá, the guide adds, were known as “stallions” prized above all other slaves. “That’s my tribe,” Adepitan says quietly. The Londoner, who was born in Lagos and left with his parents after contracting polio when he was 15 months old, gazes out at the Atlantic pounding the rocky coast. Where many Africans jumped, preferring suicide to what lay ahead. More than a million died before reaching the Americas. “What happened here for them was just the beginning,” says Adepitan, aghast.It is easy to forget how much BBC travel programmes have changed. What used to be an endless procession of genial white male presenters encountering “colourful” foreign lands and cultures is slowly becoming a erse genre. Which, apart from anything else, makes for better telly. Travel documentaries are so much more nuanced, interesting and moving when people with actual connections to places go or return to them. Or someone really smart and self-aware, such as Sue Perkins heading up the Mekong river. It makes a difference when “colonial” is used to describe history as well as architecture.Adepitan begins his four-part quest by parachuting over the bleak, mountainous landscape of Cape Verde, Africa’s most westerly point, in a modified wheelchair. For a moment, I was fooled into thinking this might be the kind of silly, upbeat documentary in which Adepitan zip wires across the continent. But the fun pretty much ends here. Even when he meets the next generation of star footballers at Ivory Coast’s hallowed ASEC Mimosas club, where Kolo and Yaya Touré lived and trained, a positive story ends with the thousands of young men trafficked abroad every year by dodgy football agents. Yet another of Africa’s remarkable resources ruthlessly exploited.On the island of Fogo – and Adepitan’s ability to get around the most inaccessible and remote places is amazing – he visits a village in the shadow of an active volcano that buried half the homes in red hot lava when it last erupted. The local taverna owner is unperturbed. “I’ve lived through two eruptions and never known anyone to be killed by the volcano,” he shrugs. One active volcano is nothing compared with centuries of destruction wreaked by man.In Senegal Adepitan finds that fish are, as the international sea shanty goes, increasingly scarce. That is due to the 116 foreign industrial fishing boats out there, turning it into fishmeal for western cattle and farmed salmon. Adepitan asks a fisherman who is to blame. “The sorry state of Africa is Europe’s fault,” he replies. “They take all of Africa’s resources. There’s another kind of slavery now.”Next, Nigeria, the most populated country in Africa, and its capital, Lagos, where Adepitan was born. He visits some fellow polio survivors who, like him, are disabled and love sport. They career about on skateboards, or rather scraps of wood attached to wheels, playing the most impressive game of football I’ve seen. One man, Ortega, takes Adepitan out on his tuk-tuk, modified so it works with hand controls. He shows him the bridge under which he lives.Then it’s on to a megachurch which looks more like a football stadium and can apparently hold a million evangelical Christians. Nevertheless, they are building a bigger one. A squirming encounter with a representative from the Redeemed Christian Church of God ensues. He says the church’s vision is to … help more Africans out of poverty? Nah. To build churches all over the world. Adepitan does ask him about the pastor’s private jet and notorious wealth, which he defends on the grounds that it is a necessity. Ducking both an invitation to join the church or probe further, Adepitan moves on swiftly. “If you get a rollercoaster I’ll think about it,” are his parting words, which feels somewhat satirical considering there is an actual funfair in the town surrounding the church headquarters. This world. You couldn’t make it up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9541cd9c19a4c913ef005d7e0e50929bea148df/0_267_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c068f3f28a387b5b75f0600a76296b63","title":"why the likability question pursues 2020 female candidates even as they make history","story":"Women have already made history in what is shaping up to be a crowded and erse field for Democrats, but the question of whether they’re ‘likeable’ or too ‘nice’ persistsWhen Elizabeth Warren declared her intention to run for president in the 2020 US election, a debate swiftly followed over whether the Democratic Massachusetts senator could pass a “likability test”.New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked by a reporter if she was perhaps too “nice” to take on Donald Trump immediately after making her own announcement on her intention to run.And California senator Kamala Harris faced scrutiny in right-wing media circles over her dating history after formally jumping into the presidential race.As a record number of Democratic women seek America’s highest office – and look to limit Donald Trump’s presidency to a single term – familiar patterns have emerged in the narratives that surround them. But so, too, has a backlash to the old tropes, bolstered by the election of a record number of women in the 2018 midterm elections.“I think in 2016, the idea that ‘likeable’ was gendered wouldn’t have even come up. In 2019, people clearly recognized it and called it out,” said Jess McIntosh, who served as a communications aide to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the last election cycle.“The thing that makes me the most hopeful about intractably sexist media coverage, is that with multiple women candidates in the race it becomes really obvious what women have to deal with.”Women have already made history in what is shaping up to be a crowded and erse field for Democrats, with the 2020 election poised to mark the first time more than one woman has fought for the party’s presidential nomination.It’s a far cry from when Clinton stood alone in the 2008 primaries, and was infamously told by Barack Obama in a Democratic debate that she was “likable enough”. The coverage of Clinton in her first presidential bid drew widespread criticism for a relentless eye on everything from her personality and clothes to the tenor of her voice and what some media outlets characterized at the time as her “cackle”.“Like her or not, one of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued – and accepted – role of sexism in American life, particularly in the media,” Katie Couric, then the anchor of the anchor of the “CBS Evening News”, reflected not long after Clinton was defeated by Barack Obama.Eight years later, there was a palpable shift when Clinton launched her second campaign for the presidency. Much of the conversation around gender centered not on Clinton’s appearance or temperament, but rather the historic nature of her candidacy and the former secretary of state’s qualifications for the role of commander-in-chief.What did not change, however, was the question of “likability” and ongoing commentary over Clinton’s trustworthiness – the latter propelled by the controversy over her emails and what some reporters have themselves acknowledged became a double standard in media coverage.A report by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, released in the aftermath of the 2016 election, examined the role of gender in the campaign and found a double standard within perceptions of honesty and likability for women compared with men.“Research on gender stereotypes reveals that voters may be less likely to expect honesty and ethical behavior from men than from women,” the report stated. “As a result, it is entirely possible that women candidates might be held to higher standards than men when it comes to honesty and ethics in their pasts and on the campaign trail.”While the report found several factors contributed to those perceptions – namely the often misogynistic rhetoric that was a staple of Trump’s campaign rallies – its authors suggested the media played a role in advancing gender stereotypes by placing a constant emphasis on Clinton’s honesty and likability as opposed to that of her male counterparts.But the backlash to the 2016 election was, in many ways, what paved the way for change.The 2018 midterm elections ushered in what was dubbed as the “year of the woman”, as American voters sent a historic number of women to Congress.Stephanie Cutter, a former aide to Barack Obama, said the momentum sparked by Trump’s election enabled female candidates to campaign more explicitly on their gender as an asset.“Look at all those freshman candidates who fully embraced the fact that they were balancing work and family, that their kids were on the campaign trail, that they were dealing with breastfeeding and carpools and making their lives work while also running for office,” Cutter said.“That was enormously appealing, particularly to all the women out there who are dealing with the same things every day.”McIntosh said the #MeToo movement, which cast an unprecedented spotlight on sexual assault and harassment across a range of powerful industries, also brought with it a profound impact on how women are treated at every level, including by the media.“You really can’t overstate what it means to have gotten some of these really badly behaving men out of positions of extreme power,” she said, while adding the emerging 2020 Democratic contenders: “If we froze the field right now, the top three candidates are women.”“There are more women journalists, editors, anchors, and in charge of media organizations … Women have bigger platforms than ever.”Indeed, when a former mayor of San Francisco recently penned an open letter about dating Harris decades ago while implying he helped advance her career – the move was panned by several mainstream journalists.“This is the kind of sexist power move that men have been pulling on women for too long and it’s embarrassing and needs to stop,” Kasie Hunt, an MSNBC news anchor, tweeted.The “likability” factor nonetheless continues to loom over women candidates, with differing views as to whether the implication is inherently gendered.Jennifer Lawless, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia, said the disproportionate attention paid to Warren’s “likability”, as opposed to that of Harris, might instead be a construct of name recognition.“I think that has less to do with the fact that Warren is a woman, but that she is by far the most prominent nationally of these candidates and she has taken on Donald Trump very publicly for some time,” said Lawless.The candidates, for their part, have addressed gender to varying degrees but maintained a steadfast focus on the issues.Warren, Gillibrand and Harris are all running on a platform of progressive priorities, that includes Medicare-for-All, debt-free college tuition and reversing tax cuts for corporations and wealthiest Americans.Asked at an Iowa town hall last week if a male candidate was better suited to challenging Trump than a woman, Harris said it was a conversation that should simply not be entertained.“In my entire career, I’ve heard people say, when I ran and ran as the first woman who would win … ‘people aren’t ready, it’s not your time, nobody like you has done that before’”, Harris responded.“The people who vote, the people who live in this country are smarter than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbac9503aabe5a868f64a2dd344a23389de9c017/0_0_3600_2355/master/3600.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b36cfd45c7824287d2dd0e448b57b10

other European countries are expected to recognise Juan Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela on Monday if the current president, Nicolás Maduro, has not set a date for fresh elections by then.However, in a combative interview broadcast on Sunday night, Maduro said: “We don’t accept ultimatums from anyone. I refuse to call for elections now – there will be elections in 2024. We don’t care what Europe says.”EU leaders, including the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, started expressing their support for Guaidó before the midnight deadline on Sunday night.Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan is due to fly to Ottawa to meet European and Latin American leaders in a new international contact group to discuss the most effective ways of supporting Guaidó.Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said: “This crisis poses huge security, humanitarian and economic challenges for the entire hemisphere.”She dismissed Maduro’s proposal of an early parliamentary election, calling it a farce, and said “the ultimatum ends tonight”.France, Germany, Spain and the UK have been closely coordinating their support for Guaidó, assessing the best form of sanctions to press Maduro into holding the elections. None supports the kind of military intervention repeatedly suggested by the US president, Donald Trump. They regard Trump’s claim that a military option is on the table as counter-productive since it conjures up memories of past US destabilisation in Latin America.Maduro also addressed the US stance in his interview with Spanish television channel Antena 3. He promised to leave the White House “stained with blood” if Trump insisted on pursuing what he called a “dirty” imperialist conspiracy to overthrow him. Addressing Trump, he asked: “Why would you want a repeat of Vietnam?”The EU was unable to come to a collective stance on Venezuela last week when the Five Star wing of the Italian coalition government objected to recognition of Guaidó.There are isions on the issue not just within the Italian coalition, but also within the Five Star Movement (M5S). Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of M5S, defended his refusal to recognise Guaidó as interim president saying he “had not been elected by the people”.So far the US and about 20 other countries have recognised, or are on the brink of recognising, Guaidó. But Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba have defended Maduro, rejecting outside interference as orchestrated by Trump. Canada and the Lima Group of Latin American countries, which are aiming to find a solution to the Venezuela crisis, recognised Guaidó on 23 January.Much of the Ottawa meeting will be taken up with the humanitarian consequences of the crisis. Freeland’s diplomatic service has played a backroom role in helping organise the opposition to coalesce around Guaidó. She said: “The Maduro regime is now fully entrenched as a dictatorship.”On Sunday Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke to the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to coordinate the call for elections. He has said the aim of the Ottawa meeting is to push for peace, democracy and stability.One proposal is to seize “corruptly obtained” overseas assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime and use the cash to ease the humanitarian crisis as Venezuelan refugees flee abroad, such as tocountries such as Colombia.The Labour party in the UK has not recognised Guaidó, despite his being a member of Socialist International, though it has stepped up its criticism of Maduro, once a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn.The shadow attorney general, Lady Chakrabarti, speaking on Sunday to Sky News, said: “Last year’s reporting on Venezuela is pretty damning and that’s in terms of disappearances, that’s in terms of crushing dissent, that’s in terms of reports of torture, of prisoners and political prisoners, and it is completely unacceptable.“I think it is incumbent on people like me, as a member of the left, to call out governments and states of the left because human rights have to be applied with an even hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941af719152e2c1eeac9d140cb2505d62d13d84e/0_295_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb3fe3e22574ae449aac5c2d4b207c9c","title":"indonesia seeks to ban negative foreign influences on music","story":"Artists concerned that draft bill, which follows outcry over K-pop band, will destroy freedom of expressionHundreds of musicians in Indonesia have lashed out against what they say is a ludicrous draft bill that could “destroy” repress freedom of expression.Among the most contentious aspects of the draft is Article 5, which outlaws “negative foreign influences” as well as blasphemous or pornographic content, punishable by imprisonment or a fine.Jerinx, a member of the Indonesian punk-rock band Superman is Dead, is one of 200 musicians who have criticised the proposed legislation.Writing on his Instagram account, Jerinx said the draft bill would “rape his rights of freedom of expression, and eventually destroy them”.The Balinese drummer also pointed to what he described as “high-level hypocrisy” from the Indonesian government, given that President Joko Widodo is widely known as a fan of foreign heavy metal bands such as Metallica.The exact target of the bill is unclear, although there is occasional uproar about the perceived immorality of foreign popstars.In December a TV ad featuring members of the K-pop all girl band, Blackpink, which showed them wearing miniskirts and short dresses, was pulled after the broadcasting commission said it flouted decency and moral norms. In 2012 Lady Gaga was forced to cancel a sold-out concert in Jakarta after Islamic hardliners threatened to physically stop her from getting off the plane.Indonesian musician Kartika Jahja said the bill, which “came out of nowhere”, had in recent days united artists from across the country and musical spectrum to form a coalition to reject the bill.“Everyone is concerned because there are so many problematic chapters inside the draft,” Jahja told the , “For me personally the first one is the chapter that regulates the content of music, that it cannot contain negative influences from the West and blasphemy and so on. I think that is a very dangerous ground, if that bill is passed, to silence musicians because music is one of the greatest and biggest agitators for various social and political movements in this country.”The coalition launched a petition against the draft law on change.org on Sunday evening, which by Monday had been signed by more than 65,000 people.In addition to overlapping with existing copyright and other laws, the draft bill on music further contradicts Indonesia’s 1945 Constitution, which upholds freedom of expression in a democratic state, the petition states.Concerned the bill will “shackle freedom of expression”, a group of Indonesian musicians met with lawmakers to discuss the it last week, calling for comprehensive discussion with artists and industry players and further consideration before the legislation is tabled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22c4f592ea9748b9c1f77f3ef549fd0303579ab/0_238_4655_2793/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31d2e6855a32d77dc982e3194a639e36","title":"lhumanite france socialist communist newspaper","story":"Hard-left newspaper issues plea to subscribers with court to rule in insolvency caseThe venerable French communist newspaper L’Humanité is fighting bankruptcy, with even rightwing politicians taking out subscriptions to help keep it afloat.The 114-year-old daily has appealed to readers to support its “great battle” to continue publishing as a court prepares to rule next week on whether it can be saved.The paper was founded in 1904 by the French socialist leader Jean Jaurès and became the official paper of the French Communist party after 1920. It was an important player in the French press after the second world war, but daily sales have fallen from hundreds of thousands of copies at its height to about 30,000 copies today.The French government’s system of giving direct and indirect state subsidies to all press titles has benefited L’Humanité, and successive French presidents have sought to ensure the title kept going until now. Its Italian equivalent, L’Unità, folded two years ago.But the paper’s falling advertising revenue and declining sales have pushed it into crisis. With insolvency proceedings under way, the title is struggling to find solutions.L’Humanité’s editor, Patrick Le Hyaric, told the  the paper had “an extremely heavy cash-flow problem” because of production costs, falling advertising and subscriptions that do not plug the gap.He told a court hearing last week it was important to find a way for the paper to continue publishing even if the receivers were called in.Le Hyaric argued that L’Humanité was part of French media history. “It represents the workers’ movement, the left, the history of France and the republic, the resistance and also a kind of French independence: during France’s opposition to the war in Iraq, the paper backed that position. Whether you’re on the left or right, you can see that if L’Humanité disappears, a part of France will disappear with it: the pluralism of opinions, the confrontation of ideas.”The paper, which employs 200 people, has made an urgent appeal for subscriber support in recent weeks and high-profile supporters from the arts and politics will gather at an event in Paris next month.Julien Dive, a Picardy politician from the rightwing Les Républicains party, was one of several figures on the right who made a donation and subscribed. He argued it was important to protect a variety of views in media and what he called a “monument of the French media landscape”. He said the paper’s coverage was always “impassioned and different” and it was important for people to read views they didn’t necessarily agree with.In an editorial, the daily Le Monde warned: “The paper, former mouthpiece of the Communist party, has already been on life support for several years … The new call for readers’ generosity will allow it to gain a few more months but it’s hard to see how L’Humanité can survive in its present form.”Le Monde said the threat to L’Humanité’s survival was “bad news for the pluralism of the media and for freedom of expression”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608d038f43fefabb5ea7ff714de6bafa805ccac5/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=661d8c60a644bf15acd30961ea41dc35","title":"monday briefing backstop must go say hard brexiters","story":"‘Malthouse’ technical solution for border ‘only game in town’, says ERG … battle for cystic fibrosis drug … Super Bowl’s half time bare chestTory Brexiters and Remainers come together today in the first meeting of a new working group aimed at examining whether technological solutions can eliminate the backstop. The “Malthouse compromise” – named after the junior minister, Kit Malthouse, who brokered it – is a proposal to replace the unpopular backstop with alternative technological arrangements to prevent the return of a hard border with Ireland. Steve Baker, vice chair of the European Research Group, has indicated the only acceptable way to move forward is to remove the backstop. “As far as I’m concerned the Malthouse compromise is the only game in town if we’re going to reach an agreement in Brussels,” Baker said.The three days of talks trying to find a compromise come in the wake of the carmaker Nissan confirming it would not build the new, flagship X-Trail vehicle in the UK, saying the uncertainty was affecting businesses. The Japanese car manufacturer announced in 2016 it would make the new version of the X-Trail SUV at the factory in north-east England after receiving assurances about Brexit from the government, but on Sunday it said it would be produced in Japan.Cystic fibrosis drug – Campaigners are calling on the government to urgently intervene over the cost of Orkambi, a drug that can extend the lives of thousands of children with cystic fibrosis, but which manufacturers have set at £105,000 per patient per year ... a price the NHS can’t afford. Ministers are being urged to revoke the patent on the drug. Negotiations over the price have been in stalemate since July, when Vertex, the Boston-based pharma company that makes it turned down the NHS offer in July of £500m over five years for access to Orkambi and other drugs.Emiliano Sala – The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch is expected to make a statement today after the wreckage of the plane that was carrying the Premier League footballer was located on Sunday morning. The find comes after a search boat was hired privately by Sala’s Argentinian family – thanks partly to a crowdfunding appeal. The crew passed the details of the location to government investigators, who used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to examine the spot. There was no immediate official confirmation of what was found but the shipwreck specialist leading the private investigation, David Mearns, said the plane had been discovered.Hermes offers better rights – The courier company is to offer drivers guaranteed minimum wages and holiday pay, in the first UK deal to provide trade union recognition for gig economy workers. Under the agreement with the GMB union, Hermes’ 15,000 drivers will continue to be self-employed but can opt into contracts with better rights. It comes after almost 200 of the company’s couriers won the right to be recognised as “workers” at an employment tribunal last summer.‘Stained with blood’ – Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, has warned Donald Trump against pursuing what he called a “dirty” imperialist conspiracy to overthrow him. “Stop. Stop, Trump! Hold it right there! You are making mistakes that will leave your hands covered in blood and you will leave the presidency stained with blood,” Maduro warned during a combative TV interview. “Or is it that you are going to repeat a Vietnam in Latin America?” he asked. In the interview he also rejected European calls for elections, saying: “We don’t accept ultimatums from anyone.”Super Bowl fails to score – Once again the New England Patriots were crowned Super Bowl champions overnight, beating the LA Rams 13-3.

When Elizabeth Warren declared her intention to run for president in the 2020 US election, a debate swiftly followed over whether the Democratic Massachusetts senator could pass a “likability test”. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked by a reporter if she was perhaps too “nice” to take on Trump. And California senator Kamala Harris faced scrutiny in right-wing media about her dating history.Research published after the 2016 election examined the role of gender in the campaign. It found voters may be less likely to expect honesty and ethical behaviour from men than from women. “As a result, it is entirely possible that women candidates might be held to higher standards than men,” it found. But, as Sabrina Siddiqui writes, the record number of women elected to Congress in the 2018 midterms, dubbed the “year of the woman”, may partly have come from a backlash against Hillary Clinton’s experience where her honesty and likability were held to a different standard than her male counterparts.England are sweating on the fitness of Maro Itoje amid concerns he could be ruled out for the rest of the Six Nations tournament, after he limped out of the encouraging win over Ireland.

Photograph: Getty ImagesIrish employers will need to make their workplaces more “age-friendly” to accommodate greater numbers of workers aged over 65 , according to new research.Latest census data show the over-65s are the fastest growing population segment in Ireland, and this increase in the older population is a trend projected to continue.Moves towards increasing the State pension age and the removal of mandatory retirement mean the age-profile of the workforce is likely to increase significantly.A study into the implications of longer working lives says employers will need to invest in redesigning offices or factory floors to allow older workers to thrive for longer.The report gives the example of a BMW plant in Germany, which noted a decline in productivity at the plant where there was a higher number of older workers.Employers introduced physical changes to reduce wear and tear on workers’ bodies, such as magnifying lenses to reduce eye strain, weight-adapted footwear and special chairs and tables which adapted to each worker’s height. In addition, a physiotherapist developed strength and stretching exercises for the workers.The changes led to a 7 per cent increase in productivity, and lower levels of absenteeism.The study, Living longer, learning longer – working longer? Implications for new workforce dynamics, by academics at Dublin City University (DCU) says flexible employment terms will also be needed to make work more flexible to retain employees as they grow older. This includes more part-time work, job-sharing and home-working options to allow older people fulfil caring and other roles. The report also highlights the need for more access to lifelong education given the rapid pace of change in the nature of work.“The only certainty is that working life in the future will require adaptability, flexibility and the continuous acquisition of new skills,”says the report.Ireland, however, has a relatively poor track record of adult participation in lifelong learning, with rates of participation below the EU average and declining with age.This, the report says, would benefit the over-50s in particular by giving them the necessary education and training to maintain and enhance skills and knowledge to help equip them for longer working.The report also addresses “misconceptions” about older workers, such as that they are unwilling to engage in education and training.Research indicates that older workers were found to be as likely to succeed in education and training as younger colleagues. It also cites a study which indicates that older workers appear to perform as well as younger colleagues, subject to good health and updated skills.“Evidently a balance needs to be found between, on the one hand, recognising the functional capacities of older workers and, on the other, providing relevant support to ensure optimal performance,” says the report. The issue of performance management can arise as an area of concern for employers in connection with longer working. For example, many employers were found to be concerned about the possibility of increased incidences of exits on the grounds of diminished capability.However, research indicates that far fewer employers reported such an increase in practice. Various studies and experts recommend regular assessment of the age profile of the workforce as an important step in creating an age-inclusive culture.Among the mutual benefits to continued engagement by older workers in theworkplace is the retention and sharing of the organisational wisdom.There is also a potential positive impact on older employees’ self-esteem when taking on mentoring roles, as well as benefits to younger workers.The report was authored by Prof Maria Slowey, director of the higher education research centre at DCU, and Tanya Zubrzycki, a researcher at the centre."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3780918.1549225809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"households not signed up for bin collection to be inspected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA radio and social media campaign warning about the clampdown is planned for the spring. Photograph: Ben BirchallPA Wire A nationwide offensive is to being launched against tens of thousands of homes not using authorised bin-collection companies, with TV licence-style inspectors to knock on doors with the threat of on-the-spot fines.Local authorities are passing by-laws throughout the State, ramping up their powers to act against households illegally disposing of waste, in what officials are calling the “endgame” for fly-tipping and rogue collectors.The new powers will allow for an “intelligence-gathering” system whereby licensed kerbside bin collection companies will pass on the Eircodes of paying customers to authorities.A database will then be used to pinpoint neighbours with no known waste-collection service.Hugh Coughlan, regional co-ordinator of the Eastern Midlands Regional Waste Office, expects about 80,000 households across Ireland will be identified, “a significant minority who are outside the system”.“It is unclear what they are doing with their waste,” he said.“We know there are quite a few people who use civic amenity sites, but people may also be using illegal operators – the ‘man in the van’ type operation – or dumping or burning their waste.“It is those who we are trying to specifically target.”Households who claim to be using civic amenity facilities or who are sharing bins with family or neighbours will have to show documentary evidence.Those found not to have satisfactory waste arrangements face €75 fixed-penalty notices, with 21 days to pay to avoid a prosecution.Repeat offenders can be hit with fines of up to €2,500 if brought before the courts, while persistent contravention could be met with penalties of €500 for every day of the continued breach after conviction.Dublin City Council passed its waste management by-law in recent weeks. It is expected that the vast majority of other local authorities will have adopted the same powers by April this year.A radio and social media campaign warning about the clampdown is planned for the spring.“These by-laws are an endgame in terms of people who are not participating, not engaged with the system,” Mr Coughlan told The .The new powers are to be co-ordinated by the country’s three regional waste authorities as part of a “national enforcement strategy”, he added.Households in Dublin not using recognised bin-collection companies could expect to get a knock on the door this year, ahead of an “overall national approach probably in 2020”.Mr Coughlan said it would be “similar” to the TV licence model, whereby inspectors identify houses with no contracts and call on them.Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton was asked in a recent parliamentary question what he was doing to curtail an increase in illegal dumping linked to a rising cost of domestic waste collection charges.Flat-rate fees for kerbside bin collections were phased out between 2017 and last autumn.Mr Bruton said a price-monitoring group within his department have considered 15 months of pricing data trends and that charges have remained “stable” in the “vast majority of cases to date”.A report on unauthorised activity in the waste sector is also being commissioned."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"TV licence-style checks and on-the-spot fines to begin, in move against fly-tippingDrop could be used to support even stricter curbs on such products, study authors argueAffordable houses set for largely social housing areas of Ballymun, Darndale, Cherry OrchardRegulator frustrated at OPW\u0026rsquos inability to identify suitable offices as workforce treblesEU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan \u0026lsquosatisfied\u0026rsquo Brussels can provide aid in \u0026lsquoany exceptional circumstances\u0026rsquoVaradkar says Government does not intend to withhold payments due to nurses under public sector pay agreements\u0026lsquoYou hear ads on the radio for all these big names playing in Vicar Street and I can\u0026rsquot believe we will be there\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD for Waterford Mary Butler claims there seems to be a \u0026lsquotwo-tier approach to regional job-creation\u0026rsquoState Examinations Commission may recruit teachers right up to start of examsTaoiseach yields to concerns around oversight layers and acceptance of responsibilitySimon Coveney\u0026rsquos Department of Foreign Affairs racked up biggest bill of over \u0026euro350,000Housing chief says \u0026lsquolocal authorities need to organise it so someone else is taking the risk\u0026rsquoCritics of restrictions say easing them could mean substantial reductions in legal costsDCU report says proportion of workers aged over 65 is set to increase dramaticallySocial Justice Ireland\u0026rsquos annual report says Ireland\u0026rsquos economic model not fit for purposeMan taking on State says it is ironic he has to use European rules to assert Irish identityDrug-related dispute suspected after locals report hearing a loud bang at about 5pmWRC finds man dismissed after pot noodle spillage on child was denied fair procedureNavigation system designed at University of Limerick guided underwater remote operated vehicle \u0026Eacutet\u0026aacuteinFurther three people being treated in hospital after the incident"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3780816.1549217956!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu has sufficient tools to help irish farmers if needed in no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Hogan: he declined to discuss the size of any potential EU package of financial supports EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan says he is satisfied Brussels has the tools to help Irish farmers in “any exceptional circumstances” that might arise from a no-deal Brexit. Mr Hogan said the EU was “ready for all eventualities” should Irish farmers suffer a collapse in food prices in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. The Irish commissioner said past crises in the EU agri-sector, including the 2014 Russia ban on EU food imports, means that Brussels has “tools available that we are able to put into effect fairly quickly”.The Government and the EU have held talks at political and official level on a package of compensation to support farmers should they suffer heavy UK tariffs and plummeting prices, in particular on beef, in a hard Brexit. Half of all Irish beef exports end up in the UK, leaving the industry with what Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described as an “existential challenge” should it face an estimated €700 million in tariffs. Overall, Mr Creed estimated that the agri-food sector faced €1.7 billion in tariffs in a no-deal scenario.Mr Hogan declined to discuss the size of any potential EU package of financial supports. “You don’t know what scale you are talking about until we see the outcome, whether it is going to be a soft or hard Brexit, so we can’t jump to conclusions otherwise we might distort the market unintentionally,” he told The .The Irish Farmers Association warned that a no-deal Brexit would be a “wipeout” for farmers in a no-deal scenario as they would face price falls of more than 25 per cent that would put up to 70,000 beef farmers out of business. “Everybody is satisfied that the tools available are sufficient to deal with any exceptional circumstances that might arise,” said Mr Hogan.In addition to loosening state aid rules the EU could provide exceptional aid under the same common agricultural market rules that Brussels funnelled hundreds of millions of euro to farmers in the Baltic states and other EU states affected by the Russia ban in response to sanctions over its annexation of Crimea.Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton said discussions were ongoing with the commission on what might happen in a hard Brexit, including any logistical supports that would be needed. He did not comment on indications his climate change plan would be postponed as a consequence of a no-deal Brexit, especially because of its implications for farmers, but he insisted on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics that Brexit would not be the latest excuse to hold off on climate action such as carbon tax.Mr Bruton said the deadline for his whole-of-government plan was the end of March, and setting a trajectory of rising carbon taxes would be part of the plan. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, reacting to an  report on Saturday that the Government plan might be postponed in a hard Brexit, said delaying climate change “doesn’t make sense” as the plan could help farmers ersify away from an over-reliance on the UK beef and dairy export market. “If anything you would want to ramp up your protections for agriculture by ersifying away from these large commodity markets,” he said. Mr Bruton confirmed that the State was facing €5 billion in fines for not delivering on its climate commitments based on current “business-as-usual” projections out to 2030. He said this threat required cuts in emissions in every sector, including agriculture. Separately, the State is facing recurring compliance costs of up to €300 million a year for failing to miss 2020 targets on renewable and carbon emissions reductions.The only concession the EU has granted up to now is on how some Irish emissions will be calculated in the future, which will make future targets less onerous, but current emissions are rising in key sectors, and fall well short of meeting even the less onerous targets.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dave MeehanThe  The use of Irish hotels by escorts has been driven down from its heights during the Celtic Tiger by a combination of enhanced security technology and staff training, according to the chief executive of Ireland’s largest hotel chain.Pat McCann, head of Irish hotel firm Dalata, said the issue of escorts offering their services in hotel rooms was more prevalent during the economic boom, and added that investing in staff training was a key countermeasure. He said upgrades to security systems and key-controlled access to lifts and other areas had improved security. Mr McCann was speaking after an article in The Sunday Times revealed how several Dublin hotels moved against a Spanish company which claims to offer “high class” escort services in their venues. He said he was unaware of any incidents at Dalata hotels, which include the Maldron and Clayton brands. The company also operates the Gibson Hotel in Dublin’s docklands.The Clarence Hotel, which is owned by members of U2 and property magnate Paddy McKillen told the newspaper it is taking “robust legal action” against the website, which is reportedly run by a Malaga based company called Siemanat SL. The company, which appears to be a shell entity associated only with the escort site, did not respond to emailed questions from The  on Sunday. The Dylan Hotel told The Sunday Times it would be asking for its name to be removed, while the Clontarf Castle Hotel said its solicitors had written a cease and desist letter to the agency. Despite this, all three hotels were still named on the Target Escorts site on Sunday.Two of Dublin’s Michelin star restaurants - Chapter One and Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud are suggested to users of the site who wish “to try out the exquisite cuisine in the city”. However, clients of Target Escorts will be disappointed if they follow the company’s advice to dine in Thornton’s, which closed in 2016. The website describes the “typical Irishman” as “a rather sharp, beer loving and thoroughly honest man - that much we can only confirm at our premium escrt agency in Dublin”. It boasts of the capital as the birthplace of “world-famous hedonist Oscar Wilde”. “Although O. Wilde rather preferred to fish on the other side, he would have loved the graciousness of our companions of elite escort service Dublin,” according to the website.

Photograph:  ReutersHenry Nicholls Theresa May has appointed three hardline Brexiteers to an official working group charged with finding “alternative arrangements” to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. Brexiteers Steve Baker, Owen Patterson and Marcus Fysh will join Remainer former ministers Damian Green and Nicky Morgan in the working group which will meet for the first time on Monday.“The government is establishing an Alternative Arrangements Working Group which will hold regular meetings with Steve Barclay, the secretary of state for exiting the EU. Officials from HMRC, Cabinet Office Europe Unit, Number 10 and other relevant departments will support this, and ministers will be able to commission advice from them,” Downing Street said in a statement on Sunday night.The announcement came hours after Mr Baker warned the prime minister that she will face another defeat for her Brexit deal if she fails to renegotiate the legally binding withdrawal agreement. Writing in the Sunday , Ms May suggested a liberal interpretation of the amendment MPs backed last Tuesday which called for the backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to ensure the Border remains open.“Graham Brady, whose amendment MPs united around, made it clear that while replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements was one option, he would also be happy with the current backstop if there was a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism,” she wrote.Mr Baker said, however, that Conservative Brexiteers had only backed the amendment on the understanding that Mrs May would pursue the “Malthouse compromise” which calls for a tariff-free area and maximum facilitation of customs to replace the backstop.“Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement. Now the PM co-opts us into accepting everything but the backstop and, on the backstop, accepting a codicil,” he said.“The right way forward is the Malthouse compromise. If all we see is a codicil – a ‘joint interpretive instrument’ – expect a further substantial defeat for the agreement.”Home secretary Sajid Javid said attorney general Geoffrey Cox would lead the government’s effort to secure a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit to the backstop. The EU has ruled out both of those options and stated that adequate technological solutions to keep the Border open have not been developed.\u0026nbspMr Javid said that Britain’s border control agency told him existing technology could avert the need for a hard Border.“I asked Border Force months ago to advise me, to look at what alternative arrangements are possible, and they’ve shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology. It’s perfectly possible. The only thing that’s missing is a bit of goodwill on the EU side,” he said.Nissan confirmed on Sunday that it is shelving plans to build a new vehicle at its Sunderland plant, citing uncertainty over Brexit as a problem for businesses as they plan for the future. Last week, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported that British car production had fallen to a five-year low in 2018 as fears of a no-deal Brexit inhibited new investment.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignEmiliano Sala\u0026#39s father \u0026#39desperate\u0026#39 as plane wreckage found in ChannelComment: Royal family evacuation plan is Project Fear on steroidsInside the RAF\u0026#39s new fast jet trainer: the machine built to help pilots counter their G-force \u0026#39measles\u0026#39Comment: The Tories must be fair but firm about deselecting Remainer MPsComment: We are changing Instagram to support people tormented by suicidal thoughtsCrocodiles roam flooded streets as floodgates of major dam opened in Queensland\u0026#39Shocking\u0026#39 rise in obesity-related cancers among young adults300,000 extra operations could be carried out every year \u0026#39if surgeons planned holidays in advance\u0026#39Microplastics are being glued together in the ocean by bacteria making them big enough to see with the naked eye, scientists find Women need to be less \u0026#39squeamish\u0026#39 about making money, Liz Truss saysFashion retailer Boden sparks fury with new sexism row Taxpayers increasingly leave filing their returns until the last minuteComment: Is this June election talk a ploy to scare MPs into backing Theresa May\u0026#39s appalling deal?Fragile Tory truce over Brexit starts to crack as Eurosceptics suspect backstop back-pedallingBoris Johnson dismisses snap election talk as \u0026#39scare tactic\u0026#39 to win support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealMatt Hancock prepares to tell Instagram boss to purge site of self-harm and suicide postsBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro \u0026#39on feeding tube\u0026#39 after surgery to remove colostomy bagThree taken to hospital after \u0026#39noxious substance\u0026#39 attackPolice forced to apologise for dirty squad car after \u0026#39bit of banter\u0026#39 tweet caught officers off guardMP urges others to seek help as he speaks about battle with body dysmorphia saying \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t feel good enough\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/03/TELEMMGLPICT000187305764_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoVHpc64Dw_9TYL9Y5RROLZ-ZgooieFKsJBLUiIW1rGg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"search teams find emiliano salas plane wreckage underwater investigation","story":"Cardiff City\u0026#39s matchday programme paid tribute to Emiliano SalaMy Feed\u0026lta, unfollowed: You unfollowed Cardiff, and will not see articles about them in \u0026lta \u0026#39mytelegraph\u0026#39 \u0026#39follow-team__text-link\u0026#39My Feed\u0026lta}}\u0027Emiliano Sala\u0027s father has spoken of his anguish and disbelief after wreckage of the plane carrying the missing Cardiff City footballer was discovered in the English Channel.Speaking at his home in Argentina, Horacio Sala said he was desperate after a privately-funded search operation found the aircraft in waters north of Guernsey on Sunday.I cannot believe it. This is a dream. A bad dream. I am desperate, Mr Sala told local broadcaster Cronica TV.I communicated with them every day, but since I do not have WhatsApp it\u0027s hard to call them or call me.They told me that the days passed and there was no news of Emiliano or the plane.The Piper Malibu N264DB that had been carrying 28-year-old Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, disappeared over the English Channel on January 21 after leaving Nantes in France for Cardiff.Two vessels, including one commissioned by the AAIB, using sonar had been taking part in a fresh search covering an area of around four square nautical miles.Search for missing aircraft in the English ChannelMarine scientist David Mearns, the director of Blue Water Recoveries, led a team on the search vessel FPV Morven while the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) also sent a team aboard its the Geo Ocean III.Mr Mearns tweeted: Wreckage of the plane carrying Emiliano Sala and piloted by David Ibbotson was located early this morning by the FPV MORVEN. As agreed with the AAIB they moved the GEO OCEAN III over the position we provided them to visually identify the plane by ROV.The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by Police. The AAIB will be making a statement tomorrow. Tonight our sole thoughts are with the families and friends of Emiliano and David.The privately-funded operation on behalf of the Sala family was made possible after a campaign raised more than £260,000 to pay for it.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Mearns said: This is about the best result we could have hoped for the families.But tonight they have heard devastating news and in respect of the families I won\u0027t comment any further about what has happened.Seat cushions, believed to be from the plane, washed up on a beach last weekEarlier on Sunday, Mr Mearns, who claims to have located more than 20 major shipwrecks during his career, said the AAIB had a high confidence level the plane would be in the search zone.It has been an anxious and heartbreaking time for the Argentinian striker\u0027s family since his plane disappeared.The plane had requested to descend before it lost contact with Jersey air traffic control.An official search operation was called off on January 24 after Guernsey\u0027s harbour master Captain David Barker said the chances of survival following such a long period were extremely remote.Saturday saw a display of Cardiff City scarves and jerseys, flowers, messages and other tributes to Emiliano SalaTwo seat cushions, which are likely to have come from the plane, were found earlier this week.The AAIB was advised by its French counterparts on Monday that part of a cushion was found on a beach near Surtainville on the Cotentin Peninsula. A second cushion was found in the same area later that day.Cardiff had signed the footballer for a club record £15 million and he was due to start training last month.Comment: Royal family evacuation plan is Project Fear on steroidsInside the RAF\u0026#39s new fast jet trainer: the machine built to help pilots counter their G-force \u0026#39measles\u0026#39Comment: The Tories must be fair but firm about deselecting Remainer MPsComment: We are changing Instagram to support people tormented by suicidal thoughtsCrocodiles roam flooded streets as floodgates of major dam opened in Queensland\u0026#39Shocking\u0026#39 rise in obesity-related cancers among young adults300,000 extra operations could be carried out every year \u0026#39if surgeons planned holidays in advance\u0026#39Microplastics are being glued together in the ocean by bacteria making them big enough to see with the naked eye, scientists find Women need to be less \u0026#39squeamish\u0026#39 about making money, Liz Truss saysFashion retailer Boden sparks fury with new sexism row Taxpayers increasingly leave filing their returns until the last minuteComment: Is this June election talk a ploy to scare MPs into backing Theresa May\u0026#39s appalling deal?Fragile Tory truce over Brexit starts to crack as Eurosceptics suspect backstop back-pedallingBoris Johnson dismisses snap election talk as \u0026#39scare tactic\u0026#39 to win support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealMatt Hancock prepares to tell Instagram boss to purge site of self-harm and suicide postsBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro \u0026#39on feeding tube\u0026#39 after surgery to remove colostomy bagThree taken to hospital after \u0026#39noxious substance\u0026#39 attackPolice forced to apologise for dirty squad car after \u0026#39bit of banter\u0026#39 tweet caught officers off guardMP urges others to seek help as he speaks about battle with body dysmorphia saying \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t feel good enough\u0026#39Teenage girl left needing surgery after being shot by air rifle in random attackWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/21/TELEMMGLPICT000186241427_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"simon mayo says bbc made mistake pairing jo whiley uncomfortable","story":"Simon Mayo has joined the new Scala radio stationSimon Mayo, the broadcaster, has spoken candidly about his decision to leave his Radio 2 show after an “uncomfortable” period he now calls a “mistake”.Mayo, who left the BBC show last year, disclosed the BBC only told him he must have a new female co-host via his agent, in a bid to change the “very blokey” line-up that went on to back fire.After being joined by Jo Whiley in a new-look line-up, the show was heavily criticised by formerly loyal fans until the BBC announced the pair would go their separate ways in October.“It was not how I had imagined the end of my career at Radio 2 would work out!” he said.“I certainly had no intention of going anywhere. I had thought I would stay there until I was 94, then retire and drop dead. But it didn\u0027t work out like that, so it was an uncomfortable period.”Mayo told the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine: “I came across a German word last year, Verschlimmbesserung, which means an attempted improvement that makes things worse.Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley in a publicity shot for their BBC Radio 2 show“If you work in education, the NHS or the BBC you\u0027ll go, ‘Yeah, we\u0027ve all come across that.’“They were trying to make things better. They thought it would be an improvement and make the network more contemporary. They made a mistake.”Whiley has recently spoken of the “savage” criticism she endured after joining Mayo, admitting it left her tearful and struggling to leave her home.Mayo has now confirmed the BBC had informed him he was to have a co-host via his agent, agreeing to give it his “best shot” after hearing a broadcaster he respected - Whiley - was being lined up.Having left the BBC, he has now become the face of a new digital radio station Scala, which will provide entertainment shows based around classical music.The new Scala line-up: Goldie, Simon Mayo, Jack Pepper, Angellica Bell, Chris Rogers and Mark KermodeAsked whether the BBC had tried to convince him to stay on the Radio 2 show, he said: “They wanted me to carry on doing the show with Jo. I was never quite sure what they were offering, but I just didn\u0027t think their heart was in it.”On the decision to move to Scala, he said: “\u0027When the offer came in it sounded new, positive and sparkly. I wasn\u0027t feeling new, positive and sparkly at the time\u0085”Simon Mayo will appear on Scala Radio from 10am-1pm, Monday to Saturday.Please review our commenting policyEmiliano Sala\u0026#39s father \u0026#39desperate\u0026#39 as plane wreckage found in ChannelComment: Royal family evacuation plan is Project Fear on steroidsInside the RAF\u0026#39s new fast jet trainer: the machine built to help pilots counter their G-force \u0026#39measles\u0026#39Comment: The Tories must be fair but firm about deselecting Remainer MPsComment: We are changing Instagram to support people tormented by suicidal thoughtsCrocodiles roam flooded streets as floodgates of major dam opened in Queensland\u0026#39Shocking\u0026#39 rise in obesity-related cancers among young adults300,000 extra operations could be carried out every year \u0026#39if surgeons planned holidays in advance\u0026#39Microplastics are being glued together in the ocean by bacteria making them big enough to see with the naked eye, scientists find Women need to be less \u0026#39squeamish\u0026#39 about making money, Liz Truss saysFashion retailer Boden sparks fury with new sexism row Taxpayers increasingly leave filing their returns until the last minuteComment: Is this June election talk a ploy to scare MPs into backing Theresa May\u0026#39s appalling deal?Fragile Tory truce over Brexit starts to crack as Eurosceptics suspect backstop back-pedallingBoris Johnson dismisses snap election talk as \u0026#39scare tactic\u0026#39 to win support for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealMatt Hancock prepares to tell Instagram boss to purge site of self-harm and suicide postsBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro \u0026#39on feeding tube\u0026#39 after surgery to remove colostomy bagThree taken to hospital after \u0026#39noxious substance\u0026#39 attackPolice forced to apologise for dirty squad car after \u0026#39bit of banter\u0026#39 tweet caught officers off guardMP urges others to seek help as he speaks about battle with body dysmorphia saying \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t feel good enough\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/09/11/winter-weather-24.jpg","title":"brexit germany peter altmaier gdp exports no deal uk trade","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario be for Europe’s largest economy?Click to followThe IndependentGermany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, this week unveiled a rather brutal downgrade in his country’s official growth forecast for 2019, from 1.8 per cent to just 1 per cent. This came on the back of the worst year of GDP growth for Germany (1.5\u0026nbspper cent in 2018) in five years.And one of the reasons Mr Altmaier cited for the downgrade was the negative impact of Brexit.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf German politicians like Mr Altmaier appreciate that their own country’s economic self-interest is tightly related to avoiding a no-deal Brexit that could change the terms of trade of the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, goes the thinking.But does the logic here stand up? How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario even be for Europe’s largest economy?Germany slumps to worst growth in five years in 2018Germany exported around $95bn of goods and services to the UK in 2017, making us the country’s fourth largest export market, after the US, France and China.But Andrew Kenningham, a Europe specialist at Capital Economics, is sceptical that a weakening UK economy ahead of Brexit was the primary reason for slowing German growth last year, noting that industrial disruption due to new automotive emissions regulations was influential in the third quarter contraction.“I don’t think most people would see Brexit see as the main reason for it,” he said.“It’s true that exports from Germany to the UK have been declining. They’ve probably been the weakest of its major export destinations. But they’ve also slowed a lot in China, they’ve slowed to other emerging economies, including Turkey and Russia. It’s not just exports to the UK have collapsed while everyone else is doing fine.”Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics, says Mr Altmaier was simply listing the long menu of reasons for the slowdown, rather than singling out Brexit.He suspects, based on data released previously in Beijing, that the big drag in terms of German exports in the final quarter of 2018 will turn out to be due to waning demand in China rather than the UK.But Mr Kenningham suggests that Mr Altmaier might have mentioned Brexit for political reasons, rather than economic ones.The economy minister has been vocal for some time about the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and has suggested that the UK should be allowed to extend the Article 50 process to avoid the 29 March cliff edge.But what about the hugely important German car industry? Here the bigger hit to business has been Donald Trump’s trade wars, rather than Brexit, according to analysts.Nevertheless, concerns about Brexit could be dampening corporate business investment in Germany, which has been relatively weak.Exports falling – but not just to the UKBut what about a no-deal Brexit in March? How damaging would that be for Germany? Could that rising threat galvanise politicians in Berlin?In the long-term the IMF estimates that the UK being forced to trade on bare World Trade Organisation terms would cost the UK almost 4 per cent of GDP, versus less than 0.5 per cent for Germany.But what about the immediate impact, the disruption in 2019?Mr Kenningham notes that Germany’s exports of goods and services to the UK account for around 3 per cent of its GDP.“Even if they were hit hard – say a 10 per cent fall for a few months – it wouldn’t have a huge impact if you look at it arithmetically,” he says.But he concedes that’s a narrow way of looking at it.And Mr Rakau thinks that a no-deal would certainly increase the chances of Germany tipping into recession.More pain for UK than Germany from no-deal BrexitSo could car companies, and German industry more broadly, come to the rescue of the UK government and put pressure on Ms Merkel to accommodate the British, perhaps at the expense of Ireland, which wants the backstop to be entirely untouched?Analysts are not expecting that.“I know it’s often cited in the UK that Germany industry will put on pressure – but I don’t foresee that,” says Mr Rakau.“Even the German industrial associations have put out press releases saying this is for the British side to sort out.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds of the earnings came from the cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which boasts fatter margins than Santa after a sackful of mince pies. It\u0026nbsphas a habit of defying analysts expectations on the upside which it did this time around. \u0026nbspDespite all this, Wall Street managed to get itself into a tizzy. Its scribblers and analysts drew their breath in through their teeth and pushed out a cloud of critical comment. The reason: the firm\u0027s guidance for revenues in the three month current quarter came in at\u0026nbspbetween $56bn (£43bn) and $60bn. That was\u0026nbspa shade below the $60.7bn they had pencilled it.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAmazon rolls out new delivery robot called ScoutAmazon builds vest for workers to protect them from robotsThe small miss was big enough for the shares to take a tumble in after market trading, when they lost more than\u0026nbsp5 per cent of their value.\u0026nbspWhen you consider that Amazon is capitalised at $840bn in total, that\u0027s a lot of value to shed. Some $45bn in fact.In sterling terms that amounts to £34bn, which a third more than you buy all the shares in Tesco for. The latter is capitalised at just under £22bn.\u0026nbspThe number crunchers were particularly concerned about the giant’s international business, which is still losing money.\u0026nbspAlthough losses have been falling, the Indian government has thrown a fly into the ointment with new rules designed to protect local businesses from giant foreign e commerce operators.\u0026nbspIt has done the sort of thing Britain’s bombed out bricks and mortar retailers have been calling upon our Government to have a go at, without (to date) much success.\u0026nbspWhile this has resulted in the removal of some of products from Amazon’s website, the company has responded by hunkering down and promising to keep at it. Which is what it always does.\u0026nbspOh and finance chief Brian Olsavsky says it’s going to spend more money this year. There is no greater exponent of that old proverb “you’ve got to spend money to make money” than Amazon.There are many, many reasons for criticising the monster this business has become, and feeling ambivalent about the impact it has had on the world.\u0026nbspIts workers are sometimes treated very poorly. It has had a devastating effect on other businesses. It pays about enough tax to buy a couple of Echo Dots (that’s the company’s crazily high selling crazily cheap mini speaker) and a month’s subscription to Amazon Music to go with them.Then there’s the corporate welfare it’s been sucking in back home in America. \u0026nbspYet you still have to admire the way its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos seems sublimely unconcerned about the huffing and puffing of analysts and commentators in response to the latest quarterly results.\u0026nbspI even saw one saying they thought the best may be over for the business.

Hazel Sheffield reportsClick to followThe IndependentBrian Kavanagh has worked for Sgaia’s Vegan Meats since 2017Brian Kavanagh had been a butcher in Glasgow for more than 20 years when one night, everything changed.His wife, a committed vegan, showed him the film Earthlings, a 2005 documentary narrated by Joaquin Phoenix about the suffering endured by animals at factory farms and research labs.\u0026nbsp“The next morning I went into work and nothing felt right,” Kavanagh says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Suddenly the idea of putting something dead inside my body didn’t feel right.”Kavanagh was working as a manager on the meat counter at Morrisons. He had a\u0026nbspyoung family and bills to pay. He kept his feelings to himself. But going into work became harder each day.McDonald’s Sweden launches ‘McFalafel’ as first vegan Happy MealThese are the most common misconceptions about vegansWhat it’s like to stay in the world’s first vegan hotel suiteEventually he found work at a small pizza chain. When that closed down the owner of the business introduced him to Hilary Masin and Alberto Casotto, the founders of a vegan meat company called Sgaia’s Vegan Meats.Since 2017, Kavanagh has been working with the firm\u0026nbspat its Glasgow base, producing vegan meat for its\u0026nbspsuppliers and working on new recipes to meet demand. “I am a lot happier – it’s like night and day,” Kavanagh says.\u0026nbspSgaia’s is one of a rising number of food manufacturers branding their products not as vegan alternatives, but as a radical new type of meat. The size of the market for alternatives is still tiny compared with the global meat market, but there are signs the meat industry is watching closely.\u0026nbspIn the US, the beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while the French have passed a law banning vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon.\u0026nbspWhen Sean Monson, the producer of Earthlings, co-produced another film about animal rights abuses in 2018 called Dominion, groups in the meat sector reacted angrily. Patrick Hutchinson, the chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council, said the film was an “upsetting” representation of the industry. “What the film shows is not representative of the practices of the wider industry,” Hutchinson says. “The vast majority of their employees are deeply committed to ensuring the most humane experience possible for animals.”Veganuary finishes with record number of participantsBut Kavanagh says that even as a butcher, he was shielded from the worst practices in the industry. He got into the trade at 16 after seeing a job with a family-run shop advertised at the job centre. “When the first meat van came in, it had the first quarter of a pig with the head still on. I remember thinking I was going to throw up, but you just kind of get used to it,” he says. He stayed with the family butcher and moved on to Morrisons when it closed down, clocking 20 years in the trade.\u0026nbspAt Sgaia’s, Kavanagh is in charge of running the kitchen, keeping up with orders and experimenting with new recipes. He has just developed a square sausage recipe using similar spices he used to use in meat sausages, but switching out the animal protein for gluten and soy.\u0026nbspNext, the company is working on vegan black pudding to add to its growing range of vegan burgers, bacon, pepperoni slices and even steak. “It’s been interesting to use my knowledge for something different,” he says. “The meat all gets sliced the same way in a meat slicer, which I have been using for more than a decade, and after all that practise with sausages, I am pretty fast with a knife.”Founders Masin and Casotto, who both have Italian heritage, started making vegan meat from their home kitchen in Wales in 2013. “We’re really into making food,” Masin says. “After we turned vegan we tried to make salamino for our pizza, which is a kind of ham, and then it became more and more like a challenge to research the way these meats are cured and stored.”\u0026nbspThe business partners started to sell their products at festivals and markets, which led to enquiries from shops and cafes. Masin still remembers the panic when they got the first 14 orders through their website, before they knew how to pack the products and ship them out. “I was studying at university at the time and Aberto called me and said, ‘We can’t do this, it’s too much.’”12 best vegan shoes for womenAfter sell-out appearances at vegan festivals, Sgaia’s moved to Glasgow where it has been supported by a small business growth grant from Paisley Council to take on a catering kitchen and office space. In January, the company sold 5,000 units and 500kg of fake meat products through a handful of ethical suppliers, including Suma, Marigold Health Foods and Greencity Wholefoods, and the company website, which reads: “We don’t make fake meats: they are real, just vegan.”Many vegan meat or food technology companies are trying to get their products stocked in the meat aisles at supermarkets, where environmentally-conscious customers will be confronted with the dilemma of which product to buy. In the US, Beyond Meat has created a burger made principally of yellow pea protein that mimics the texture and taste of meat, with the intention that supermarkets sell the product alongside animal protein. In July, Sainsbury’s trialled stocking plant-based products in refrigerators alongside slaughtered meat.\u0026nbspMasin says the barrier for smaller competitors such as\u0026nbspSgaia’s\u0026nbspis not where plant-based products are stocked, but how hard it is to comply with complex safety rules and to produce at scale. “We’ve been contacted by the major retailers, but because we’re so small it’s difficult for them to work with us,” Masin says. “When the quantity is there, we will look at it.”After two decades in the meat industry, Kavanagh is enjoying working with a much smaller company. He mostly keeps his veganism to himself, apart from when he is manning the pop-up kitchen at vegan festivals, where customers are amazed by his butcher past: “If you’re working for a supermarket, it’s all about profits, basically – whereas this is about making a difference.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has come up against the management team on a number of occasions and sensationally ousted chief executive Sergio Bucher from the board last\u0026nbspmonth.Ashley bought Sir John Hall’s 41.6 per cent stake in Newcastle United for £55m in May 2007 and acquired the whole club two months later.Ashley’s approach of sitting in the stands wearing a Newcastle shirt rather than in the director’s box initially helped make him popular with fans, as did appearances at local pubs on match day. \u0026nbspHe appeared on live television downing a pint of beer with fans in the away stand during Newcastle’s August 2008 game against Arsenal in London, flouting a Premier League ban on consuming alcohol pitchside.But the\u0026nbsprelationship with fans has since soured and many\u0026nbspbelieve he has failed to invest sufficiently, to the detriment of the club.UK retailer Evans Cycles was sold to Sports Direct as part of a pre-pack administration. Ashley’s purchase saved the brand, but half of its 62 UK stores will close, putting hundreds out of work.Ashley has agreed to buy Sofa for “a nominal sum”, ending a battle with ScS Group for the online furniture retailer.The Sports Direct owner seems to be linked to just about every high street store that has struggled over the past year. He has held talks with HMV’s administrators and is rumoured to be sniffing around posh cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Putting an exact figure on the value of his combined holdings is tricky but Forbes puts it at $3bn (£2.3bn).Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, partner at Hewitsons, said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent-free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year\u0026nbspwhich are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. However, Rutgers University in the United States last year\u0026nbspconcluded students scored the equivalent of half a grade less in end-of-term tests if they were allowed to use their devices for non-academic reasons in their classes.Children will also be told to break off at least every two hours and avoid social media before bedtime, according to\u0026nbspguidance from chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies,\u0026nbspThe Daily Mail reported. Parents will be told to limit children’s screen time to protect their health.The UK would be following in the footsteps of European counterparts if schools were to introduce a mobile phone ban, with French pupils being told to leave their smartphones at home when they returned from their summer holidays last year.Teachers in the UK have also complained about pupils being distracted or using the phones to take upskirt images of staff in the classroom.Toddler development delayed by too much screentime, research suggestsMr Gibb is the latest figure in education to support such a move, with former Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw saying devices were disrupting lessons.Speaking at the Festival of Education at Wellington College last summer, Sir Michael said that “any sensible head would ban mobile phones”.He\u0026nbspadded: “It’s interesting that President Macron is now bringing in legislation in France to ban mobile phones in state schools in France. We should do the same here.\u0026nbspIt’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. Texting, sexting, all this takes place.

In a new book, ‘Do They Mean Us’,\u0026nbspCatherine Lough\u0026nbspfinds the eastern European community there is fearful for its futureClick to followThe IndependentThe Lincolnshire town voted with a 75 per cent majority to leave the EUWhen I meet Martyn Chambers, deacon at St Mary’s Catholic Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, he describes the town as “geographically isolated”.Mike Cooper, a Conservative councillor, suggests that many Westminster politicians could not place Boston, or Lincolnshire, on a map.Boston is a picturesque market town, dominated by the medieval tower of St Botolph’s Church, known locally as the Stump.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2001, its population comprised just 55,750 people, 97 per cent of whom were white British. By 2011, the population had grown to 64,637 people, 15.1 per cent of whom were immigrants.As people migrated from eastern Europe to work in local farms and factories, Cooper suggests the demographic shift was a “massive, seismic change”. He cites this as the reason behind the 2016 EU referendum result.What you can do to help demand a Final Say on BrexitThis “isolated”\u0026nbspplace had the highest recorded percentage of Leave voters in the country, with 75.6 per cent voting for Brexit. For the national media, Boston was suddenly on the map.Local politicians give various reasons for Boston’s support of Brexit. Anton Dani, an independent councillor who formerly represented Ukip, blames the pace of change. “If you suddenly have an influx of 30,000 people, people start to resent that,”\u0026nbsphe says.Dani seems an unlikely Ukip candidate he is Moroccan-born\u0026nbspand his wife is Polish. Indeed, we discuss our families’ experiences of immigration – Dani moved to the UK in the 1980s, working briefly for Marco Pierre White. My father emigrated from Argentina at the same time.Now, he runs Café de Paris, a European-style deli in Bridge Street. Yet he criticises the lack of integration in Boston as a factor behind the result.Boston is rural and labour-hungry, so there can be no suggestion that migrants are competing with locals for jobs.Created with Sketch.Britain before Brexit: Yorkshire and the Humber Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent’s photographer Richard Morgan is examining his own country in the midst of Brexit’s chaos, scrutinising the contrasts of contemporary Britain and the ambivalence of modern Britishness.

He is on his way to see a band in Manchester that sing about the apocalypse and plans to wear the gas mask as a tribute.A hungry Romanian man begging in front of super-enlarged images of food. He must be experiencing an acute sense of alienation: unable even to spell the word ‘please’ in the language of the society in which he is trying to survive.

The life of the high street is framed by these commercial announcements, silhouetted by their bright glow and sense of crisis.The Jamia Masjid Swafia Mosque is surrounded by high security fences, suggesting an attempt to protect itself from a local threat. There are surveillance cameras too, scanning, and they reach as high as the mosque’s crescent moon.The entrance to the Frenchgate Shopping Centre has been decorated with poetry by local poets. I suppose it is meant to brighten the place up. People walk by to do their shopping, surrounded by stories of the city and the Yorkshire region. A man waits in the hallway, uses the pillar for support, and is told of another thing he is lacking in his life. The walls of this cafe are adorned with paintings of what it’s not, of what it would like to be, perhaps, hanging there like negative mirrors, reflecting back into the emptiness the vibrancy of Parisian cafe culture in full bloom. I wonder if this place used to be a shop selling meaning to the unfulfilled, like some kind of high-street church. It has long since closed down, but the sign remains, playing a joke on the emptiness of the facade. An arcade in the town centre reserves its slot machines in three languages: English, Romanian, Polish. The lady who works there doesn’t know what the second two languages are, but says they get a lot of Eastern Europeans coming in. She tells me I’m better off photographing the ‘spice people’ - addicts to the recently emerging drug known as ‘spice’. I follow a RAF parade through the streets, thinking about the relationship between the armed forces and the civilian high street. As they march past a casino, I consider the contrasting elements: control meets chance, order meets luck, preparation meets possibility. A sign promising redevelopment is a year out of date. It is an exceptional thing to see in York\u0027s city centre and it stands out opposite a street of busy bars. Maybe it has been left there as a joke, or as a warning, or as a work of art.The RAF parade lines up outside the Minster. I notice an arrangement of people that speaks to me about the role of women in modern British society: underrepresented, but central. Outside the the Grand Hotel there is a scene of contrasting ideas about Scarborough. Simultaneously, the town is represented by multiple images: a family holidaying, ideally a solitary man smoking and staring out to sea a town being attacked, under siege. I visit a cabaret show in the ballroom of the hotel. I look for a scene that portrays the stark differences between audience and performers: an injured, resting, healing limb serenaded by high-heeled sex appeal.A shop is closing down and is trying to get rid of its stock. There is a curious row of weapons on offer, and seemingly, like an afterthought, \u0027beach stuff\u0027.A view of North Bay from the cloisters on the cliff edge.

There are surveillance cameras too, scanning, and they reach as high as the mosque’s crescent moon.The entrance to the Frenchgate Shopping Centre has been decorated with poetry by local poets. I suppose it is meant to brighten the place up. People walk by to do their shopping, surrounded by stories of the city and the Yorkshire region. A man waits in the hallway, uses the pillar for support, and is told of another thing he is lacking in his life. The walls of this cafe are adorned with paintings of what it’s not, of what it would like to be, perhaps, hanging there like negative mirrors, reflecting back into the emptiness the vibrancy of Parisian cafe culture in full bloom. I wonder if this place used to be a shop selling meaning to the unfulfilled, like some kind of high-street church. It has long since closed down, but the sign remains, playing a joke on the emptiness of the facade. An arcade in the town centre reserves its slot machines in three languages: English, Romanian, Polish. The lady who works there doesn’t know what the second two languages are, but says they get a lot of Eastern Europeans coming in. She tells me I’m better off photographing the ‘spice people’ - addicts to the recently emerging drug known as ‘spice’. I follow a RAF parade through the streets, thinking about the relationship between the armed forces and the civilian high street. As they march past a casino, I consider the contrasting elements: control meets chance, order meets luck, preparation meets possibility. A sign promising redevelopment is a year out of date. It is an exceptional thing to see in York\u0027s city centre and it stands out opposite a street of busy bars. Maybe it has been left there as a joke, or as a warning, or as a work of art.The RAF parade lines up outside the Minster. I notice an arrangement of people that speaks to me about the role of women in modern British society: underrepresented, but central. Outside the the Grand Hotel there is a scene of contrasting ideas about Scarborough. Simultaneously, the town is represented by multiple images: a family holidaying, ideally a solitary man smoking and staring out to sea a town being attacked, under siege. I visit a cabaret show in the ballroom of the hotel. I look for a scene that portrays the stark differences between audience and performers: an injured, resting, healing limb serenaded by high-heeled sex appeal.A shop is closing down and is trying to get rid of its stock. There is a curious row of weapons on offer, and seemingly, like an afterthought, \u0027beach stuff\u0027.A view of North Bay from the cloisters on the cliff edge. There are infinitely more perspectives that one can take, but I found this one and it affected me. The graffiti and the initials of the National Front darkened the view of the British seaside.Cooper says the town has “always relied on overseas labour” but cites pressures on infrastructure and housing as a reason for the result. Unscrupulous landlords exploited the increasing demand.“We’ve found some absolute horror stories,” he says. “People living in sheds two storeys up. That’s why people said,\u0026nbsp‘enough is enough.’”Cooper acknowledges the government’s austerity measures may have exacerbated problems. Boston is a low-wage economy\u0026nbspand Boston Borough Council lacks the funding to build new homes (Boston is also on a flood plain, which makes it expensive to build).UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitOne of the local estates has no money for street lighting at night. “Then they say austerity doesn’t hurt people,” he says. Has it made him doubt his own party? “Yes.”Not everyone agrees that immigration levels have been excessive. The agricultural economy relies heavily on migrant labour.Lamb feels people voted for Brexit “partially out of ignorance”, yet were also misled by the Leave campaign. In her view, it simplified complex issues: “The thing with a referendum is\u0026nbspit’s one question that really covers a hundred, or a thousand questions.“But we are desperate for these people. The way we’ve treated them and made them feel will be to our cost.“People don’t realise how they actually fill the plate. How when you go to hospital, nine times out of 10, it’s not a migrant who’s taken your place, it’s a migrant looking after you”.Her words are borne out by research from the Migration Advisory Committee\u0026nbspthat found EU migrants contributed £4.7bn more in taxation than they received in benefits in 201617, as well as contributing “much more to the health service …\u0026nbspthan they consume”.The report does echo concerns in Boston about pressures on housing. Immigration can increase\u0026nbsprental prices through greater demand, yet the report suggests that, rather than being a net result of migration, these issues are partly caused by political decision-making\u0026nbspand local authorities with “a higher refusal rate on major developments”.Arguably, pressures on services are caused by a lack of planning and foresight from the government.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveHow does the Polish community feel?For the Polish community, the referendum result has caused considerable uncertainty.Outside St Mary’s Church, I speak to Eva Kowalska, an administration worker who moved from Poland in 2006. She describes Boston then as “a small village” now, its streets are bustling.“Eastern Europeans built Boston, basically,” she says. “Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the fields and the factories were Polish.”After Brexit, Kowalska feels she can no longer plan for the future. She is unconvinced by Theresa May’s wavering assurances that EU migrants will be protected –\u0026nbspthe lack of clarity is too unsettling. “A lot of eastern Europeans are terrified,”\u0026nbspshe says.Kowalska had thought of Boston as her home, but now she feels uncomfortable. “I don’t want to feel like a stranger here,” she says.\u0026nbspHer experiences with locals have been positive\u0026nbspand she was shocked by the referendum result.Przemek Frankowski, who works in the White Hart Hotel, also supports the idea of a second referendum: “I’ve always been pro-EU – I feel it’s better to be within something bigger than being separate,” he says.He has lived here for 13 years and has never felt unwelcome in Boston (“I’ve blended within the British community”) but thinks the impact on services might have contributed to the result, as well as drunkenness from a minority of immigrants.He has not witnessed visible tension or racism, although he does recall hearing people say, “We want our country back” when television crews visited the town in 2016.For Frankowski, who has a young daughter, what concerns him most is uncertainty over the future of EU migrants in the UK.“That’s the one thing I would get worried about,” he says. “We hope we’re not going to be told, ‘Oh, well, I’m sorry but you have to go. We don’t want you anymore.’ That wouldn’t be fair on anybody.”Brexit humiliation is stark reminder of Britain’s waning influenceWe have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectHow can we tackle this Brexit mess? Give more money to the northMiki Bura, a fellow employee who moved to Boston aged nine, says his parents felt shocked and unwelcome after the referendum. “People around here thought we were really coming to take over, but that’s not true,” he says. “All we’re trying to do is get a fair play in life.”Newly-arrived immigrants are understandably more nervous. Zlana and Zlatiana Goneva, who moved from Bulgaria in 2017, run a brightly painted café selling crepes and pastries. Zlana was stunned by the result:\u0026nbsp“We came here to live our whole life. When you hear people voted against us, it means they don’t like us.“It’s strange, because we don’t make problems. We work, we help their economy.”At St\u0026nbspMary’s, I speak with Martyn Chambers as Father Kowalski prepares for the Polish-language mass.Throughout our conversation, parishioners arrive bearing parcels for a Ukrainian children’s charity. When children sing in Polish at the front of the mass, the sense of belonging is palpable.Created with Sketch.10 things immigration has done for Britain Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 1959 classic, that is, perhaps our greatest piece of industrial design, a miracle of packaging and revolution in motoring.

It so sometimes forgotten that it was Enoch Powell, then Minister of Health (1960-62), who campaigned to recruit their skilled nurses to come and work over here. One abiding legacy we can thank Enoch for.It seems absurd that anyone would question the Polish community’s presence here.Chambers feels Boston is misrepresented as a fractured or ided place. “We had easily in excess of 20 nationalities at the English morning mass,” he explains. “Polish people attend the English mass. To make out the Polish community has been a problem ignores the other communities we’ve had for many, many years.”He points out the long-standing Keralan, Filipino and Portuguese communities here.For Chambers, people voted for Brexit because they were misled, especially with regard to promises about the NHS. “Politicians were throwing out facts and figures like confetti,” he says. Boston’s size and geographical isolation may also have led to resentment over rising immigration levels. “The difficulty for Bostonians was the speed of change.”Despite this, he thinks “there is a great sense of community. If you go into schools, the children all have friends of different nationalities.”Indeed, the Ofsted report for Staniland Academy, which has a high proportion of EAL (English as an Additional Language) students, describes pupils who are “curious about each other’s cultures and backgrounds, and get on noticeably well together”.“The changes are coming through the young people of the town,” says Chambers. “And I passionately believe that’s showing already.”Catherine Lough is a freelance journalist studying for an MA in international journalism at City, University of London.

According to the latest survey by\u0026nbspWhich?Travel, the Irish budget airline faces an uncertain future. To sustain its flying programme across Europe for 2019, the airline must sell 280 seats per minute. Yet according to the magazine: “Ryanair’s reputation has declined so much that thousands of respondents told the consumer champion that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its rivals.”The editor, Rory Boland, said of the airline: “It has spent the past two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and flouting the rules on compensation as well. The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, which prove that budget prices don’t have to mean budget service.”Ryanair’s share price has lost one-third in the past year, and is 40 per cent down on where it was in the summer of 2017. That was the summer when Ryanair started to upset passengers who choose not to pay for assigned seating. From May 2017, couples and groups who accepted “random seating” typically found themselves sitting in middle seats at the opposite ends of the aircraft. In September that year, thousands of passengers found their flights abruptly cancelled due to a shortage of pilots – which ultimately led to the grounding of 20,000 flights through the winter.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe airline then misrepresented its obligations to travellers whose flights it had cancelled, saying it was not responsible for finding departures on other airlines – even though the European air passengers’ rights rules (known as EC261) state carriers cancelling flights must pay for alternatives. Ryanair had its knuckles rapped by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The number of seats per minute Ryanair needs to sellSoon afterwards the airline gave in to demands by crew for union recognition, the first time it had happened in 32 years.The result: a string of strikes by pilots, cabin crew and airport staff. Many of them were coordinated by the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which said: “Demands of Ryanair workers – such as pay for all hours worked and an end to long-term agency employment – continue to go unaddressed.”\u0026nbspDuring 2018 many hundreds of flights were cancelled because of strikes by pilots and cabin crew. Some of the passengers affected sought compensation under EC261 regulations. Payouts are set at €250 (£223) for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£357) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Their applications were rejected by Ryanair – which claimed the industrial action was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” and was “totally beyond the airline’s control”.But in another unprecedented intervention, the CAA urged grounded holidaymakers to claim their entitlement. Ryanair still refused, and in December 2018 the authority launched enforcement action, insisting “consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation EC261”. For an airline to change its cabin-baggage policy more than once a decade is unusual – but Ryanair passengers had to adhere to three different sets of rules in 2018.Now Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert, has written to the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, about what he claims is a “systemic error” in the Ryanair booking process that changed travellers’ surnames in the same booking to be the same as the lead passenger’s. His organisation has sent a dossier of more than 160 cases to the CAA.Ryanair’s present travails are at odds with its image as the cheeky underdog. In the 1990s, as a tiny Irish airline, it seized on the European Union’s “open skies” policy to create its leading hub at Stansted airport, flying British travellers across Europe and providing Continental travellers with cheap access to London and beyond. But as Brexit approaches, some say the Irish carrier is in disarray, losing passengers in droves and seemingly destined for oblivion.How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and paying prodigious returns to shareholders?\u0026nbspYet Ryanair is set for another year as the most successful airline in Europe, flying close to 150 million people. How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised simultaneously be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and, relative to its rivals, paying prodigious returns to shareholders? The answer lies in Ryanair’s business model, which takes the “keep it simple” principle to extremes.\u0026nbspThe airline has long operated only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800. Pilots, cabin crew and engineers can work on any plane in the fleet. The 189 seats are another constant, avoiding the problems that other airlines – such as easyJet and British Airways – encounter when they “downsize” an aircraft.Ryanair has not always been faithful to Boeing – in the early days it used Romanian-built BAC 1-11 planes, and after it bought the KLM offshoot, Buzz, for a short while it had BAe146 jets in the fleet. But the path to success became apparent as the world assimilated the tragedy of 911. The attack on America changed much in aviation, with airlines cancelling flights and aircraft orders wholesale. And Ryanair was transformed by behaving in the opposite way .In the summer of 2001, Michael O’Leary was known in the airline business as a maverick, who had rescued an ailing regional airline by cutting fares to stimulate business. But by the end of September that year, he had become the fiercely controversial figure he remains – telling Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme that British Airways and other airlines were “screwing” the government for financial support.On 14 September 2001, the day that flights were allowed to resume across the US, with 50 new security directives in place, Boeing announced 25,000 lay-offs. In the next few days, Virgin Atlantic cut 1,200 jobs, together with its routes to Toronto and Chicago, while Aer Lingus shed 1,600 people – more than the total number employed by Ryanair. Two months after the tragedy, Ryanair predicted profits for the full financial year of close to £100m – about £10 for every passenger flown. Other airlines were haemorrhaging cash, or simply going bust (Ansett Australia, Swissair, Sabena of Belgium...).The order books of Airbus and Boeing were full of cancellations. With some almost-new jets being flown to the desert for storage, no one was buying new aircraft. Which, from the point of view of a fast-expanding, opportunistic airline is the ideal time to order some new planes. In bulk. On 24 January 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737s with options on 50 more – the largest ever deal for the world’s most popular plane. The cost per aircraft remains a closely guarded secret but was probably around half the list price.Created with Sketch.Travel Photographer of the Year 2018 Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Low-cost aviation relies on keeping costs down. That is obvious to say, but much harder to do. Many elements of flying, such as fuel and air-traffic charges, are priced the same whether you are British Airways or Ryanair. But aircraft ownership costs are negotiable, and at a stroke Ryanair had achieved a deal way better than its rivals.With the fleet set to treble in size, the airline set about expanding its network in a very low-cost way: setting up operations at “secondary” airports. Budget travellers soon became accustomed to finding their way to and from Frankfurt Hahn (closer to Luxembourg than to the German financial hub), Girona (“Barcelona” in Ryanair’s view) and Charleroi (“Brussels south”). Regional authorities poured millions of euros in “marketing support” into Ryanair’s operations, with accusations that the airline was benefitting from state aid.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round tripDuring an expansion that has proved, so far, recession-proof, the airline has long moved into the main airports for those cities, to the dismay of incumbents such as Lufthansa, Iberia and Brussels Airlines.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round trip, while Lufthansa of Germany has five flights each way from dawn to late evening. Passengers on business want frequent flights and a near-certainty that they can get a seat on the next departure – yet Ryanair’s model is to fill its planes as close to capacity as it can.In December, which for the first half is as low-season as the travel year gets, Ryanair flights were 95 per cent full – meaning just nine or 10 seats on the average aircraft remained empty. That achievement is all the more remarkable given the intensifying competition in short-haul aviation.\u0026nbspRyanair and easyJet have a long history of not competing head-to-head. Over the years there have been some spectacular fares wars: easyJet retired hurt after launching flights to Ireland, and for a while it was difficult to pay more than £10 from Luton to Copenhagen. While the two giant carriers have historically competed on only a handful of airport-to-airport routes, expansion makes it increasingly difficult to avoid. And even though Primera Air of Iceland and Cobalt of Cyprus have recently gone bust, other budget carriers are expanding.\u0026nbspWizz Air, the eastern European specialist, is now flying from Luton to a range of western European destinations. Norwegian Air and BA’s sister airline, Vueling, are also chasing the same market. And the “legacy carriers” from Air France to SAS are cutting costs to stay in the game. Ryanair begins 2019 as combative as ever. Cabin crew employed in Spain were planning strikes on 8, 10 and 13 January after failing to reach an agreement over employment conditions, but the airline faced them down.Ahead of Brexit, Ryanair has obtained a UK air operator’s certificate that will allow it to operate British domestic routes and flights to destinations outside the European Union after 29 March. All the available evidence shows that the lowest-cost provider wins in aviation – even with consumer voices raised against it.Ryanair may feel picked on by the authorities. At this time in 2018, Air France workers were gearing up for 15 days of strikes that disrupted many thousands of British travellers. Some BA passengers faced problems during the cabin-crew strikes that dragged on for months during 2017. Yet when the European Court of Justice ruled in April 2018 that wildcat strikes did not consititute “extraordinary circumstances”, the Civil Aviation Authority failed to urge BA and Air France travellers to claim compensation.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Travel readers seem to have it in for Ryanair. The Boeing 737s it flies are identical to the bulk of Jet2’s fleet. They hold the same number of people in the same configuration. The only significant difference is that Ryanair’s fleet of 737-800s are younger. Jet2’s score for seating and cabin environment was four stars, while Ryanair received only one star.The most fundamental requirement for any airline is safety, but when an organisation called Airlineratings released its top 10 for “the world’s safest low-cost airlines”, Ryanair was nowhere to be seen.\u0026nbspThe UK’s struggling Flybe and the Anglo-German Thomas Cook Airlines made it, but there was no place for the Irish airline. Which is perplexing, because if you measure safety in terms of flying the highest number of passengers without any of them dying in an accident, Ryanair has the best safety record in the world by a country mile. Since its first flight in 1985, the airline has safely flown 1.25 billion people. Second place goes to easyJet, at 900 million passengers.People\u0026nbsphave flown safely with Ryanair since 1985British travellers have begun another year as the beneficiaries of the best-value air travel in the world, provided by the safest airlines. When easyJet was founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in 1995, his main message was that travellers could fly from London to Scotland for £29 – the price of a pair of jeans. Checking flights two days ahead, Ryanair will take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for under £26. And if that’s still too much, the airline will take you from Essex to Italy for under £15.At a time when Europe is fragmenting and slightly more than half the UK apparently wants to be alone, Ryanair is arguably doing more to keep the continent together than a planeload of politicians: connecting families, enabling employment, allowing travellers to discover that Europe is a fascinating mosaic of cultures rather than an amorphous whole.Back to that\u0026nbspWhich? Travel\u0026nbspsurvey: “Of those who said there was one airline with which they’d never travel, 70 per cent named Ryanair – no other airline came close.”Every passenger in Europe benefits from the existence of Ryanair. So while I find it surprising that the airline inflames so much adverse reaction, I believe that even the “bad-boy” image is a consumer benefit. By annoying sufficiently many people who have vowed never to fly on Ryanair, the Irish airline helps its rivals stay in business and keeps competition flourishing.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has held talks with HMV’s administrators and is rumoured to be sniffing around posh cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Putting an exact figure on the value of his combined holdings is tricky but Forbes puts it at $3bn (£2.3bn).Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’ll have the entire high street soonHe has bought heavily into the high street as it faces some of its toughest ever trading conditions. Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, partner at Hewitsons, said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent-free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year\u0026nbspwhich are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men.

It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware.

(Unsurprisingly, the premise has been liked to the film\u0026nbspGroundhog Day.)After reaching the streaming service on Friday (1 February), subscribers took to Twitter to discuss the “trippy” series.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Just binged watched Russian Doll,” wrote one.\u0026nbsp”The whole season.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors.

It measures only 3000 light-years across even at its longest point, making it just a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way.Repeated radio signals coming from galaxy 1.5 billion lightyears awayIt is dark as it is feint. Together, those porperties led astronomers to classify it as what is called a\u0026nbspdwarf spheroidal galaxy.Such galaxies are defined by their small size and dim light, as well as their lack of dust and old stellar populations. Reserchers have found 36 galaxies of this kind in our nearby area, 22 of which are satellite galaxies around our own Milky Way.Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not uncommon, but the newly discovered one is strange in a number of ways. It is extremely isolated, about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and two million light-years from its nearest possible host – making it the most isolated of any small dwarf galaxy ever found.From studying its stars, scientists found that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old, making it nearly as old as the entire universe. Because it is so distant from any other galaxies – and so has been left largely undisturbed – as well as its old age, the astronomers refer to Bedin 1 as a fossil from the beginning of th ecosmos.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What happens to UK trade with them after Brexit? Ben Chu looks at the state of playClick to followThe IndependentBrexit? It’ll be the ‘easiest thing in human history’As a full member of the European Union since 1973 the UK has effectively outsourced responsibility for making trade\u0026nbspdeals with other countries to the EU institutions.And those institutions have been busy.The EU now has more than 50 trade deals of various sorts with third countries either in place, partly in place, or pending. A full list can be found on the European Commission’s website here.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThese range from deals with large economies such as Canada and Japan, to middling ones such as Mexico, South Korea and Turkey, to small states such as Moldova and Botswana.The prospect of Brexit – whether a no-deal rupture in March or an orderly departure after several years – raises the question of what happens to the UK vis-à-vis those EU trade deals?How dangerous for the UK economy is the European Union’s latest adviceWill the UK be able to simply roll them over, so the terms of a laboriously negotiated deal that previously only covered, say, the EU and South Africa, now also covers the UK and South Africa too?Or would we need to renegotiate them from scratch?The UK government had hoped to simply\u0026nbsproll them over or “grandfather” them.But the Department of International Trade was forced to admit earlier this month that not a single agreement to do this had so far been signed, with only two months to go when they may be needed.Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC: “I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK.

These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.This means that that UK firms which export to countries covered by those EU third country deals could suddenly the need to pay tariffs on 29 March.One of the reasons why it might be taking longer than hoped to grandfather those arrangements is something called “rules of origin” found in all in trade deals.Rules of origin specify that a certain proportion of an imported good has to have been made in the country or bloc to qualify for the preferential tariff.\u0026nbspThe proportion varies with the product in question, but it’s often around 50 per cent. The goal is to prevent other countries free-riding on other countries’ deals.According to British official, Korea is asking, in return for a rolling over of its EU trade deal to the UK, for Chinese inputs to its own cars to be treated by the UK as though they were Korean.There’s another complication. Even if third countries did roll over their trade deals,\u0026nbspwhen it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well (something Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have\u0026nbsppointed out).So the message is: when it comes to a no-deal cliff edge, don’t just worry about damage to UK trade with the EU. Worry too about UK trade with all those countries with which the EU has deals.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

The EU is committed to trying to agree alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. We want a comprehensive future relationship in place by the end of 2020 so the backstop is never used.“We want to get on with the work once the withdrawal agreement is ratified. Yet there are no credible alternative arrangements, put forward by anyone, that achieve the shared goal of the UK and EU to avoid a hard border. The backstop is a necessary guarantee, based on legal certainty, not just wishful thinking.”Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP and supporter of the pro-EU group Best for Britain accused the prime minister of a “preposterous waste of time” over the new working group.“It shows what situation the Conservative Party have got themselves into,” he said. “All the MPs involved know this plan is dead on arrival with EU leaders but yet are wasting valuable time and effort on this hare-brained scheme.”He added: “The government is in dire straits if it is creating a committee like this with only weeks till Brexit.”In a Sunday  article, Ms May wrote that she will return to Brussels “armed with a fresh mandate, news ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for”.But cracks appear\u0026nbspto have emerged in the fragile Tory truce after Mr Baker, who is deputy chairman of the influential European Research Group (ERG),\u0026nbspsuggested the prime minister was seeking something that was no more than a “codicil” (an addition or amendment) instead of getting the EU to reopen the withdrawal agreement.He tweeted in response to Ms May’s article, in which she stated that she would seek an alternative, or time-limiting changes, to the Irish border backstop.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“Trouble ahead,” he said. “Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement.“Now the PM co-opts us into accepting everything but the backstop and, on the backstop, accepting a codicil.“If all we see is a codicil – a ‘joint interpretive instrument’\u0026nbsp– expect a further substantial defeat for the agreement.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now I have a lot of invitations from all over Africa.I wanted to go to dferent countries there and learn more and to decide which place is best for me to live.It’s the latest bizarre chapter in a story which started seven years ago when Martina, a former air steward, quit her job to pursue her dream of having an extravagant Barbie figure.Twenty-four surgeries followed all over her body, including increasing her natural D breasts to the N they are now, which she inflates using a saline pump.I hope to have them made even bigger soon, she says. I want the biggest breasts in Europe.Then in January , Martina, who had previously used sunbeds to boost her pale skin, had a series of tanning injections claiming at the time she was obsessed with darker skin.Now however she insists that the injections were in fact experimental medicine designed to boost the bodys resistance to skin cancer.I had three injections. Lots of people had the same treatment and everyone reacted dferently, she says. Some people had only a little change, but for me it changed me entirely.At first I could only see my skin tone changing from light to dark to really dark, then after a while I could see my eye colour change to darker, and my eyebrow and my hair changing too.It’s a change that is inside as well as out. These changes are not superficial but deep inside me.So deep in fact that last year Martina travelled to Kenya accompanied by her long-term partner and now husband Michael.I wanted to learn more about my history and black culture, she says. While there she was baptised by a Kenyan pastor and renamed Malaika.The African people loved me, she says. On the first day I wanted to go into downtown Nairobi to a tailor to get some new clothes and when I left in the car I had people surrounding me.In footage taken by Michael - who also received the same injections as Martina, but who is left with only slightly darker skin – Martina, clad in traditional tribal clothes is shown alongside a local tribe, carrying water from a well and cooking over a campfire.“It felt very natural, very normal to me, she says.Martina hasnt decided on a final location for her move but said the northern part of Kenya, in Isiolo,  near the equator was her favourite part.I like the dry hot climate. I was able to spend all day in the sun without sunscreen and did not get sunburned. I only got darker.She maintains she has effectively changed race in the face of understandable cynicism from some quarters of the black community.I have seen a few comments saying ‘you are still white whatever the colour of your skin on the surface’ – but they mainly come from places like America, she says.In reality I have made lots of African friends who understand who I am and that I am trying to learn.I think they see that I am genuine, that this is not just the surface, I want to understand more about their history.I spend most of my time with them now as it feels easier. Compared with my white friends I have more in common with them.Since she has ed to live in her native Trier, a German town near the border with Luxembourg, she has continued to embrace African tradition.My le has changed a lot since my transformation, she says. Now I mostly wear traditional African dresses and I cook African food.My favourite meal is cooked goat meat, ugali, which is boiled corn meal flour, and sukuma wiki which is a Kenyan vegetable.Embracing this new le alongside her meanwhile is Michael - a former pilot and Martina’s childhood sweetheart – who she insists is nothing but supportive of her new le.He also had the injections although they did not have the same effect. But he was and is very supportive, very relaxed about my body modications and so is his family, she says.Tragically, her father and mother and younger sister were killed in a car accident in .Given that Martina had her first surgery the year after they died, it’s hard not to wonderher extreme surgery and skin change is not some extreme reaction to her loss. She insists not.I had started wanting to change my body in . The next year was very hard for me obviously, but the next year I felt ready.It was not about not liking who I was. I liked the white person but it is like a boy with a car that he loves – he wants to change things here and there. It’s like fine tuning.Today that fine tuning is ongoing: Martina says her skin is continuing, naturally, to get darker, while she is also planning more surgery.I want to widen my nose, make my lips bigger and have butt implants, she says. I am still a work in progress.And there’s one further deep-seated change planned: Martina and Michael are hoping to start a family in the future - and Martina believes her babies will be black.My doctor has told me it is possible as I have changed myself internally, she claims.You only have to look at my old pictures: When you compare me now with who I was I am a completely dferent person. The age in which you have to stay the race you were born in is over.People use a iety of ways to express themselves and their identity. However, when it comes to race - and Martina saying shes able to have a black child - this is a biological issue that shes misinterpreted and may cause offence.She may be having a crisis of identity due to a deep feeling of insecurity about her appearance, and it could be her way of trying to gain some control, and fit in.Deep down, it would appear Martina isnt confident or happy with her own identity, and its manesting itself in a potentially unhealthy way.I would suggest anyone thinking about making drastic physical changes like this to seek professional help first to get to the bottom of any underlying issues, as often the issue isnt physical.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A ruse to keep us trapped indefinitely and hobble us as a newly independent trading nation.Plus, they believe Tory Remainers may bottle out before they do — and delay or halt Brexit. But that’s a huge gamble.No Deal won’t affect unelected, unaccountable, untouchable eurocrats with monstrous salaries and fat pension pots.But EU politicians should be terried.If the chaos finally tips the eurozone into recession, and hundreds of thousands lose their jobs in Ireland and across the continent, they won’t thank national leaders for sacricing them on the altar of the sacred backstop.They will join the clamour to escape the EU — and elect much less moderate politicians who will make it happen.THE day after the referendum, The Sun called for billions to be pumped into ­working-class communities ignored by London’s politicians.So Theresa May’s pledges to do just that in rundown coastal towns and Labour’s former mining heartlands are very welcome.Eventhey are decades late and a ploy to win votes for her deal.New infrastructure, NHS upgrades and skills training are just what’s needed.But we would go further, with radical regional tax breaks to lure employers.Rebalancing our economy towards Leave-voting areas and away from comfortably off Remain ones is what any Government should be doing.Labour’s “people’s vote” bores are hysterical about it, of course.The status quo suits them fine and Mrs May’s tactic could — shock, horror — secure Brexit.  THEY can’t help themselves, can they Remoaners, some in Cabinet, are itching to rubbish our chances of securing the legal assurances we need.They champ at the bit to “rule out No Deal”, to surrender every last scrap of our leverage, to ensure a meaningless, supersoft Brexit or even halt it.They cannot even keep a lid on it for two weeks while their Prime Minister and her negotiators try to secure a better deal in the national interest.If our mediocre Business Secretary Greg Clark — and others who will never reconcile themselves to the majority’s Brexit decision — are so keen to rebel, let them get on with it.Quit today, or back the PM and belt up. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, EU leaders are fed up with her.She signed off on a deal with them, assured them it could get through the Commons then lost by a record margin.They are now sceptical when the British indicate that this or that change could get the deal through Parliament.Despite the passing of the Brady amendment — saying the Commons would raty the withdrawal agreementthe so-called backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border — the EU remains doubtful as to whether this is really the case.No  acknowledges that things are not easy between Mrs May and EU leaders at the moment.One member of her circle tells me they are “waiting for the anger to subside” before they head to Brussels.A well-placed European source tells me there will be “nothing tangible in two weeks”.But there is another reason, beyond their irritation, why the EU are holding off from engaging with Mrs May.They want to see what happens when the Commons next votes on Brexit, on Valentine’s Day of all days.It is expected that Yvette Cooper will bring back her amendment which would force the Government to seek an extension to Article it can not agree a deal with the EU.If Cooper is passed, then the EU could be certain that Parliament would not allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal.At that point, the EU would have little reason to offer up a signicant concession.They would know there was no danger of either short-term No Deal disruption, which would be particularly badly timed for the EU given the slow-down in the eurozone economy, or of the UK ending up pursuing a radically dferent economic course after Brexit.However,the Cooper amendment failed again, the EU would have to confront the fact that this process really might result in No Deal.They could lose a withdrawal agreement that is good for them, and the backstop would have created the very thing it is meant to avoid — the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In these circumstances, and with time ticking down, the EU would become more creative in its thinking.The hunt would be on for face-saving ways to try to salvage the agreement.This would not mean the EU would suddenly drop the backstop entirely.But it would be more open to, say, a time limit on it.With this change, the deal would stand a very decent chance of passing the Commons.I understand there is a growing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop — which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances — could be acceptable.Not all members of the ERG would take this.But enough of them probably would to make up the missing numbers with Labour MPs.Senior figures in the Government were encouraged by how many Labour MPs either abstained or voted against Cooper.They believe these MPs can be persuaded to back a deal.“There is a pool of Labour votes — and it is growing,” one Government source tells me.Getting  Labour votes for a deal now seems doable.Ministers and MPs must hang tight.Now would be the worst moment to weaken the UK’s negotiating position.“I DON’T know who has got any idea,” one leading Cabinet minister tells me when I ask what Theresa May’s plan is.The precise direction of the Government’s Brexit policy is still being debated. I am told “there is no set course”.Inside the Cabinet, the arguments are far from over.There are four Cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond – who won’t even contemplate No Deal.They are becoming increasingly outspoken in their warnings about it.This group has no intention of piping down.However, another set of Cabinet ministers are more worried about no Brexit than No Deal.One of them tells me: “The most disastrous thing for us as a party isBrexit doesn’t happen.”Another minister tells me: “The battle is only going to intensy.”But this gang of four is not as influential as they once were.The key figure from the formerly Remain wing of the Cabinet is David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy.“Liders is in the engine room. Hammond and Rudd are shouting from the sidelines,” one Tory insider tells me.Lidington is, I understand, of the view that the cross-party talks could yield something on customs.The idea would be that the UK would leave the common commercial policy, allowing it to do its own trade deals, but seek to develop a customs arrangement with the EU that would replicate other parts of the customs union.If there is a deal, the big question is how does it get through the Commons One Cabinet minister tells me that they think Mrs May should make clear before the next vote thather deal is defeated she would request a six-month extension to Article .This Secretary of State believes it would squeeze the Tory Brexit ultras, making them choose between Mrs May’s deal and a Brexit delay.THE Labour Party is about to embark on a series of ideologically driven deselections – which is all the more reason for the Tories not to do the same.Political parties must be broad churches to succeed andthe Tories set about deselecting everyone who takes a dferent view on how to achieve Brexit, they will risk turning themselves into an overly narrow faction.For this reason, local Tories should stop thinking about deselecting Nick Boles.He is wrong on ruling out No Deal, but he is right on housing and a whole host of other issues the Conservatives need to do more on.TENSIONS are mounting inside Government about the role of Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Brexit adviser.Robbins was, I’m told, deeply irritated by reports about potential changes to the UK negotiating team.But, as one insider points out to me, there is a problem with Robbins going back to Brussels.His professional pride means he is highly sceptical about whether there’s a better deal to be done.The second problem is that this is now all about what deal will get through Parliament.But Robbins, as a civil servant, understandably doesn’t have a finger-tip feel for that.Mrs May should be relying on politicians to do this most delicate of renegotiations.In response to a request from the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Chief Medical Officer has drawn up the first Government guidelines on social media usage.This advice is clearly sensible.If these social media companies want to demonstrate some responsibility, they should start introducing a two-hour cut-off for all users under .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs. But how anybody on the run can be entitled to taxpayers’ cash is absolutely beyond us.Gauke has form for dodging tough decisions.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Im going to Cardf, crazy, tomorrow we already started.

This morning, during an increasingly awkward interview with Sky News Sophy Ridge, he was confronted with two of them.Mr Bailey, who in December was polling a stonking  points behind Sadiq Khan , does not have the luxury of being able to blame youth for the unfortunate remarks - he was  when he made them.But in a few short minutes he found and delivered a dazzling array of reasons to defend them. Heres the comments he was defending - and a full list of the excuses he gave. Statement : Good looking women tend to have been around  In a pamphlet for the Centre for Policy Studies think tank in , he wrote about his experience with sex education as a youth worker. He wrote: The boys have got this opinion thata girl looks clean, and that generally means she’s good looking, she appeals to them, it is less likely she’ll have an infection” He went on to say that when he talked to teenagers, he would warn them: If a girl appeals to one that way, she’ll appeal to all of them. She’ll tend to have been around. It wasnt mentioned in the interview, but he went on to complain about condoms, which prevent sexually transmitted infections, being handed out to teenagers in schools, because it makes sex more possible. Heres some of the excuses he gave for that one.   . I didnt say that So two things, I never actually said that... He did. Its here. . ...It was a conversation ...that is me having a conversation with someone.Oh, you did say it  Glad we got that cleared up.. I was talking to poor people But let’s be clear, I’m talking about a very poor community facing very tough outcomes.It is unclear why talking to poor people rather than better off people changes the character of his comments.. I was mythbusting That’s about mythbusting, because we’re talking about boys who live in a very sexualised environment. It’s traded as a way of being popular or not.It is unclear why it is better to replace a myth that people are likely to be free of infection with a myth that attractive people are likely to be promiscuous.. Did I mention they were poor  And as I said, you’re talking about the poorest communities, and dealing with the toughest issues. It’s people like me who are on the front line having those conversations.Again, it is unclear why characterising attractive women as promiscuous is more appropriate based on the wealth of who youre talking to.. What do you think youth workers are doing  What makes me laugh about your slick, career politicians who run around saying nice things about communities, they always talk about youth work. What do they think youth workers are doing  What kind of conversations do they think were having that other people won’t have with young people Many, we imagine, would hope that youth workers are not talking about young women in that manner.  . It wasnt the smoothest language Of course, was it the smoothest language  Of course not. Andanybody’s thinking ‘why did he say that ’ Remember, you’re talking about - years ago, when I was faced with young people who are being stabbed, murdered and all kinds of things - the language isn’t the smoothest, but I’m not sitting at home thinking ‘what will look good on Sky ’ - I’m thinking how can I get across to these people Mr Baileys team has previously dismissed this particular comment as raw, blunt and the work of a man who hasn’t figured it all out. Mr Bailey now appears to be saying that the sentiment was fine, but the language was the problem.. You have to mirror the language young people are using And of course, young people I’m speaking to, I’m having to mirror the language they’re using.OK.Statement : Single mums are unacceptable, or at least undesirable  In a  article for the , Mr Bailey explained the reason our streets are so violent - and gave an account of his time growing up in London. He wrote: Many of the first single mums were housed in my part of London, reassuring them that it was acceptable - even desirable - for mothers to have babies on their own. That assumption is flawed because we now know that a child growing up without a father is so much more likely to be disadvantaged. Again, its not brought up in the interview, but he goes on to suggest women deliberately become pregnant in order to claim benefits. He wrote: For example, any young girl living in the inner city will be clued up on how the system works. They wont be too careful about not becoming parents. In some cases, they will deliberately become pregnant - as they know thatthey do, they will get a flat.So has he changed his view . Poor people make themselves vulnerable to get benefits We had a system, and in many ways we still do now, which encourages poor communities to make themselves vulnerable in order to receive benefits or be supported.No. No, he hasnt changed his view.

It is understood she undertook the daring rescue after the white bulldog-cross was seen bobbing up and down in the water. The dog belonged to an elderly man who was seen looking for his pet, HullLive reported. An eyewitness said: I think an old gentlemen lost his dog and it had jumped in the lake and couldnt get back out.  The dog became really distressed, the water must have been very cold and freezing. A woman then came along, broke the ice in front of her and jumped in. She swam  metres out into the middle of the lake and then brought the dog back with her. I heard all the commotion, looked over and just got in the water and broke the ice to get to the dog. The woman has been hailed as a hero by eyewitnesses after she braved the plummeting temperatures to rescue the hound. Members of the public stepped in and wrapped her in blankets when she emerged from the water.  The dog, which emerged unscathed, made its way onto the verge and shook itself dry. One onlooker said: At one time I thought she was going under, but she managed to get out of the water. She was very brave. She struggled at one point, but got to the dog and back in the end. She did really well, it was amazing.

Nestle feared that Cadbury’s claim could threaten its Quality Street hazelnut and carshyshyamel treat – the Purple One – and its decoration on the box. Cadbury has now surrendered its  registration for exclusive use after the Court of Appeal backed its Swiss rival.   Cadbury’s Dairy Milk bars have been wrapped in purple for over  years and it was chosen because it was Queen Victoria’s favourite colour. Trademark lawyer Rebecca Anderson-Smith said the case was “bad news” for the firm, adding: “It seems Cadbury realised their existing trademark registration would be dficult,not impossible, to enforce.   They still own a separate registration for that purple, covering ‘chocolate in bar or tablet form’.But this includes the same description of the mark considered too broad by the Court of Appeal.” Cadbury’s US owner, Mondelez, said: “We have not appealed but will continue to protect what we believe is a distinctive trademark.” Nestle hinted at further action because products like Quality Street “famously use purple”.

Stephen James has equipped the pound, trailer with several televisions, an oven, sink, microwave, bedroom, space for his dog Kaiser and parrot Charlie Bitefinger, and even a shower room. Its powered through a mix of generators and solar  that he has fitted to the roof. The -year-old is currently parked up in a lay-by near Willington in South Derbyshire, but hes stressed out by his situation because he is often told to move and hes living in fear of being burgled.   Stephen, who receives regular compensation payments, told Derbyshire Live leaving the trailer and his belongings unattended is a gamble. Hes looking for a permanent place to park the horse box. Stephen converted the horse box himself after buying it for pound, in .   He now wants to find a quiet spot, possibly one where he may be able to help farmers to protect their land amid a spate of thefts from rural properties. He said: I feel pressure all the time. It is hard for me, because I always worry thatI am out for too long someone will try to break into the trailer. Leaving is always a gamble.  I also cant find anywhere to stay that is safe for me and I wont be asked to move on. Usually, I can only stay where I am for a few weeks before I have to go where, which makes it dficult for me. Im hoping there is somebody out there who has a small piece of land where I can stay, and inI can keep an eye on their land and make sure nobody is doing anything they shouldnt be.  And Kaiser will scare off any thieves or trespassers. Stephen said he grew up in Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands and spent his childhood years in a childrens home. When he left school he got a job working as a bin man and bought a bungalow in Littleover in Derbyshire.  But he suffered an accident at work when he was in his s and he was left unable to work, he added. Stephen said he struggled to pay his bills and decided to sell his home and buy a canal boat for pound,. He said he enjoyed a quiet le on the waterways and even saved a young woman as she was attacked by a dog.  He said: I was watching an Aston Villa game at the time, when another guy I knew from on the boats came running down shouting for help. I went outside and down the path and found a woman who had a dog clamped around her arm and she was screaming. There was lots of blood. But I helped get the dog away from her and keep it away and she was taken to hospital.  Eventually, Stephen had trouble finding a safe and affordable place to moor his boat.

Zahid Khan was jailed for  years in his absence after fleeing to Dubai over a pound, number plate fraud. Hours after leaving the UK as his trial came to an end in June, Khan posted a video on social media saying sorry I had no choice. He has since revealed on Facebook that he is looking to rent out his home - complete with swimming pool and cinema. The luxury detached home in Moseley, Birmingham, has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a heated swimming pool and its own cinema, reports Birmingham Live.   It also has a jacuzzi and steam room, is fully furnished and has full CCTV and gated premises. Khan didnt say how much he was looking to rent out the property for but admitted hed even consider letting out inidual rooms. Birmingham Crown Court heard Khan, at the time , lived a playboy lestyle and may have married up to three dferent women in Muslim ceremonies, as well as having numerous affairs. He had also posed for pictures with rappers and boxers, including Floyd Mayweather when the US champion visited the UK.   A Ferrari he claimed was worth pound, was actually a former write-off and was unroadworthy. It was seized and crushed by police. As the case was coming to a close in June the fraudster fled to Dubai after being granted bail by the judge. His passport was not confiscated. He was jailed for ten years in his absence after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud.  Two brothers and a cousin were also jailed for their part in the scam, which targeted poundmillion lottery winner Gillian Bayford. Both he and his brother Aamir Khan had also both received additional -month sentences for smuggling illegal immigrants into the UK. Three more men received sentences in relation to the case.

The NHS porters at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary were spotted breaching strict hygiene guidelines designed to prevent infections. An immediate investigation has been triggered by hospital managers after the images were captured by a photographer for a Scottish newspaper. The photos were printed today by the Sunday Mail in the wake of an ongoing investigation after two newborn babies died at the hospitals maternity unit last week. A spokesman for the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the department would be investigating immediately and have already spoken to members of staff on duty on Friday and Saturday. They added: We will also be reminding staff in all of our sites of the importance of wearing full PPE.   “It should be stressed that when our porters collect waste – particularly within Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Princess Royal Maternity – the waste holds are located outside the wards, therefore he or she would never enter a ward while performing this duty. The porters were seen moving several dferent colour bags - believed to be coded based on their contents. A source told the Sunday Mail they saw some of the workers wearing gloves but at least two were not. It would seem like an obvious precaution, both for their own safety and in terms of infection control for the whole hospital, to have had something on their hands, they said. Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon has demanded a speedy and full investigation. She said: “This is a really serious matter and it must be investigated fully and without delay.  “Infection control procedures at hospitals are incredibly important. “It’s essential they are communicated to all staff properly and that they have the necessary equipment for their protection and for that of other patients and staff. Recent events have highlighted just how crucial this is and the public deserves to know with confidence that the Scottish Government is making sure our hospitals are a safe and clean environment.” Writing in today’s Sunday Mail, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the deaths of the premature babies was “desperately sad”. She confirmed a “heightened programme of cleaning and a review of infection control measures” to make sure “everything that should be done to prevent infection, and infection spread, is being done”. Dr Alan Mathers, chief of medicine, women’s and children’s Services at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, admitted last week the source of the bacteria that contributed to the deaths may never be known. A third baby also contracted the Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection but is said to be giving “no cause for concern”.   Mathers said the newborn children who died had been among the “most vulnerable patients” in the country. He added: “It may be that we don’t ever get to the root of the problem. “The issue is that everyone carries bacteria in their skin and are colonised by these things – that is very dferent from an infection. “The premature baby has lots of systems that are just not ready for the world, including its immune system.” NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde launched an investigation into the deaths on January , with Freeman informed on Monday last week. The probe emerged after prosecutors confirmed they were probing separate incidents in which two patients died in another hospital run by the same health board. A -year-old boy and a -year-old woman passed away after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. The NHS has also been battling a clinical waste crisis for weeks after disposal firm Healthcare Environmental Serviceswas stripped of its contract after collapsing in December. It has resulted in body parts, blood, tissue and other clinical waste being stored in containers outside hospitals, as well as at other sites around the country. We revealed in December that porters were furious at being drafted in to help dispose of waste after HES were axed.   But the spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde denied any link between the HES crisis and the deaths in Glasgow, insisting there had been no changes to waste management processes or pick-up frequency at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: “There has been no reduction in our waste collection service since December  when HES were no longer able to supply a service. “The storage, transport and disposal of all of our waste is compliant with national standard operating procedures. All waste is segregated and stored in safe and appropriate areas. “All NHSGGC hospitals continue to receive waste collections from NSS approved contractors with the same regularity as HES provided. “Glasgow Royal Infirmary receives a minimum of two waste collections per day, seven days per week. Additional uplts are available on request.” The Scottish Government added: “There is absolutely no link between the disposal of clinical waste and the deaths of patients. To suggest otherwise would be highly irresponsible and utterly incorrect.” About  staff were made redundant without pay over Christmas after the NHS ripped up HES contracts across the UK. Environmental protection watchdog SEPA said it was working with the Scottish Government, NHS Scotland, NHS National Services Scotland and health boards on contingency arrangements for the storage and disposal of clinical waste. We told last month how a worker at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness had suffered a needle injury moving piles of the waste, after having to take on extra duties. The GMB union confirmed four men out of a team of  porters had sustained injuries. A senior source at collapsed HES said: “Infection control is worse right now as porters are handling waste more often. “I also doubt porters have the correct protective equipment as was reported at Raigmore.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jamie oliver advised mcdonalds food","story":"NewsJamie Oliver advised McDonalds on food despite slamming their burgers publiclyThe TV chef, , has been a vocal critic of the fast-food chain, slamming their burgers as unfit for human consumption in ShareCommentsByAlys KeysAshleigh Rainbird:,  FEB NewsAs recently as , Jamie spoke out against McDonald’s sponsoring the Olympics \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJamie Oliver has been talking to McDonald’s about healthy eating for years.

The -year-old vegan, from Bristol, complained to McDonalds on Twitter but she soon received vile tweets from trolls who had discovered her plea to the Big Mac chain. Eleanor told Bristol Live she was stunned as one hurtful Twitter user told her to kill herself and others sent sexist and misogynistic abuse or accused her of overreacting.  The teen, who describes herself as a lelong vegetarian who went vegan four years ago, ordered the McDonalds wrap through UberEats while at university in Cardf on January . It was supposed to contain vegetarian red pesto goujons, tomato relish and salad. But Eleanor claims it contained chicken, and shes not the only one to make similar allegations.

She wrote: I ordered a spicy veggie wrap from one of your stores and thanks to the sheer incompetency of some of your staff I’ve been given chicken. I’ve been veggie my whole le and this has literally put me in tears as I ingested part of this wrap thinking it was veggie.

She told Bristol Live: When people think other people are questioning their lestyle they feel quite threatened by that, even when its such a small thing in their lives.I felt patronised, degraded and small by the comments. They were just nasty. She added: I was brought up vegetarian so Ive been veggie my whole le. Its for ethical reasons and the environment is a big concern for me as well.  Ive never eaten meat before and Ive never wanted to. I was quite shocked by it. Its completely disrupted my ethical beliefs and lestyle choice. Its happening all over the country, its quite serious. Eleanor reported the worst comments to Twitter and they were removed. She has not reported the abuse to police. McDonalds UK responded to her tweets, writing: Hi, sorry to hear that.

The Duchess of Sussex made the decision to write the inspiring messages on the fruit during a visit to Bristol on Friday. The pregnant mum-to-be used a black marker to scrawl handwritten notes such as be strong and you are loved. The royal made the impromptu choice to write the kind messages when meeting a former prostitute at a charity helping sex workers get off the streets. She and Prince Harry had learnt One takes them food, condoms, advice and even blankets and hot water bottles.   As they were shown the food bags being prepared in the programme’s kitchen, the Duchess suddenly said: “Oh actually do you have a Sharpie marker  I have an idea. “I saw this project this woman had started somewhere in the States on a school lunch programme. “On each of the bananas she wrote an affirmation, to make the kids feel really, like, empowered. It was the most incredible idea – this small gesture.” Armed with a marker, and with the words “I am in charge of the banana messaging!” she wrote a series of messages on the bananas destined for the food bags sent out on the outreach van including “You are special”.   However, a sex worker told The Sun that the idea was really stupid. She added: “People out here struggle to eat and sleep and she gts us some words on a piece of fruit. “She has the means to help us more than that. It’s offensive, you know.” But another homeless sex worker, who did not want to be name, said the idea was really sweet. She said: “It’s so cold right now, it’s a struggle to raise money to get a bed for the night, so any food and bedding is a big help. I think it’s great Meghan is supporting them. It is really sweet.” After Meghan had signed the banana, a volunteer said: “I can imagine being on the van, and ‘Meghan wrote this thing, and what ’ I think they might not eat it. I think that banana would be at home until it is rotten. Because I would do the same. “It sounds really cheesy, but little things like that when you are out – especially tonight, we can see the weather – just to get that little thing… Meghan took her time out to write that one. It’s lush.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nissan blames brexit axing plans","story":"NewsNissan blames Brexit for axing plans to build SUV model in Sunderland plantThe Japanese firm is reneging on a decision made in  because of the political uncertainty over the planned withdrawal from the EUShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB NewsNissan cancelled its plans to build the X-Trail x \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCar giant Nissan is blaming Brexit “uncertainty” for cancelling plans to build the X-Trail x at its Sunderland plant.The Japanese firm is reneging on a decision made in , when it said it would build the new SUV model in the UK after receiving “assurances” from the Government over Brexit .Nissan said it overturned the decision for “business reasons”, including rules on diesel engines and reduced sales.

Stephen Smith is so thin in these images taken during a hospital stay over Christmas that his bones are visible through his skin. The -year-old, from Liverpool, said he isnt healthy enough to work and he can barely walk on his own due to a number of serious conditions. He was forced to get a pass out from hospital so he could fight a Department for Work and Pensionsdecision declaring him fit and capable of finding work, and denying him benefits, the Liverpool Echo reports.   Mr Smith won that appeal after a tribunal judge saw that he can barely walk down the street let alone hold down a job. At the time, his weight had dropped to just six stone and he feared he would die as his health worsened. Repeated calls to grant Employment and Support Allowanceto Mr Smith were denied even though doctors had written stating that he couldnt walk  metreswithout collapsing in pain and exhaustion. The DWP claims he has continued to receive all of the benefits he was entitled to, but a man who campaigned on his behalf believes he is owed pound, in back pay.Mr Smith suffers from debilitating and incurable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes severe breathing dficulties that gradually get worse over time and limit normal activities.   He also has excruciating osteoarthritis and an enlarged prostate, and he uses a colostomy bag to go to the toilet. Despite his health problems, Mr Smith failed a DWP work capability assessment in  and his ESA payments were stopped. He was told to sign on for a pound-a-week Jobseekers Allowance, visit the Job Centre once a week and prove he was looking for work. Mr Smith said: I could only make it to the kitchen to make food once a day. I had no muscles in the back of my leg which meant I couldnt stand up at all - and had to lean or sit down all the time - but they were telling me I was fit for work. Mr Smith believes his le was saved by two men - Tony Nelson and Terry Craven.   Mr Nelson runs the CASA community centre, which acts as an advice and resource centre for local residents, and introduced Mr Smith to Mr Craven, a former city council welfare officer who helps people at CASA with benefit claims. When Mr Smith lost ESA, Mr Craven battled with the DWP to restore his benefits, and sent the opinions of two doctors who described the signicant dficulty and pain Mr Smith suffers when he does simple movements and daily activities. One doctors note stated: It is my opinion that Mr Smith could not walk  metres without pain or exhaustion. Despite the evidence, the DWP rejected Mr Smiths appeal in January last year and told him that he didnt meet the criteria for having limited capability for work. Mr Smith and Mr Craven continued to fight the DWP for months and were given a hearing at a tribunal earlier this month, one year on from the DWPs decision.  By then, Mr Smiths health had taken a turn for the worse as he struggled to look after himself. Mr Craven said: Around December time me and my we went to check in on him and my we said  we dont do something now, hes not long for this world. Mr Smith was suffering from pneumonia and was taken to hospital, where he was pictured weighing just six stone. After getting a pass allowing him to leave the hospital, Mr Smith attended the tribunal and won. A judge stated he satisfied the requirement for ESA due to his limited mobility and health problems. Mr Smith will be put back on ESA, and Mr Craven believes the -year-old is owed about pound, in back pay. Mr Craven said: I have got lots of cases like Steves - I have a client at the moment who is actually on dialysis and has been thrown off benefits. Mr Smith said: Without them [Mr Nelson and Mr Craven] and this place [CASA] I probably wouldnt be here today - I had nowhere to turn- they have saved my le. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the DWP claimed Mr Smith has continued to receive all of the benefits he was entitled to, as well as offers of personal support to improve his skills and health issues. She added: He has now been reassessed, reflecting his changing condition and will be receiving full ESA support. “We’re committed to ensuring that people with health conditions get the support they’re entitled to. Decisions for ESA are made following consideration of all the information provided by the claimant, including supporting evidence from their GP or medical specialist. Any claimant can appeal a decision for free to an independent tribunal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"spent week living universal credit","story":"NewsI spent a week living on Universal Credit - this is what its likeReceiving weekly allowance for a -year-old, one young reporter ended up with just £ a day to spend on food, heating and travelShareCommentsByAlex GroveBen Weich:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video what-is-universal-credit-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Governments controversial Universal Credit scheme has rarely been out of the headlines during its troubled roll-out across the country.Stories abound of claimants having to turn to food banks, and the programme was recently revealed to have the lowest satisfaction score of any welfare benefit.But what is it actually like to live on Universal Credit  Keen to demonstrate the adversities faced by those on the scheme, Hull Live reporter Alex Grove volunteered to live solely on a weekly benefits allowance, based on calculations made by the Citizens Advice Bureau. As a -year-old man living in private rented shared accommodation, with no disabilities or children, he received pound. for the month – or roughly pound. per week. But even that was quickly chipped away at by deductions, with Hull City Council tax taking pound. a week, and a further pound was set aside for gas and electric.   Alex was left with scarcely more than pound per week – not taking into account water rates, his mobile phone contract, car insurance or road tax. The most he was offered to go towards his rent was pound. a week, with any shortfall coming out of his own pocket. He said: That left me with pound a day, and I quickly realised some of my typical outgoings during the week would have to be signicantly reduced. With a limited amount of money to spend, I soon realised just how much money I waste during the week, particularly during my days at work. Takeaways were also a no-go. Lazily, I do sometimes find myself having a scroll through Deliveroo and picking out a meal or heading over to McDonalds – particularly when I’m hungover. But having a takeaway even just once a week would completely wipe out my budget, so I had no choice but to make the most of my weekly food shops and resist indulging on junk food.   It soon dawned on Alex that even Tesco meal deals – priced at pound, or half his daily allowance – would have to fall by the wayside, too. Alex added: I am a sucker for a Tesco meal deal which sets me back pound a day and although it’s a great offer, it costs me almost half of my daily budget. I knew I had to change my ways so every night I made sandwiches to take into work and bought multipacks of crisps instead of wasting money buying inidual packs as part of a meal deal. Universal Credit, dubbed a “six-in-one” payment, has been labelled a “shambles” by critical MPs. Earlier this month, the Works and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announced a string of changes to save Universal Credit from further disaster, but maintains it will be fully implemented by . Margaret Greenwood, Labours shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, has called for it to be halted entirely, claiming that it has been used as a vehicle for cuts to social security.   Reporting in Hull Live, Alex said he found that there was no room for me to be able to afford what most would constitute as a respectable social le. He wrote: Couple of pints down the pub with your mates  No chance. A meal out at a restaurant  In your dreams. On the budget I had, there just wasn’t enough money to go towards typical social activities for a man of my age. I like a tipple sometimes after a day at work, but this was something I just could not financially manage given the limited budget I had at my disposal.   Yes, you can buy packs of lager and cider in supermarkets and minimarts but these will still set you back and realistically, alcohol is something you just have to do without. He also described paying for his car to be unrealistic, as fuel prices, road tax and breakdown cover piled up. He was left to fork out for public transport fares to get to his local Jobcentre to sign on. The young reporter concluded that his weekly allowance on Universal Credit was adequate, as long as he managed to resist indulging in alcohol or recreational activities.   He said: I would have been living on the breadline and, although you receive more moneyyou have children and other relatives to look after, ultimately, you have more mouths to feed and that presents dficulties. There is a high possibility, particularly at a time when we are experiencing sub-zero temperatures, that I would have had to endure freezing cold nights and sacriced my warmth in order to get by.

Campaigner Natasha Benjamin told Birmingham Live that she has written to Instagram bosses calling for disturbing material to be taken down. Five years ago she began trawling the internet for painless ways to die. Thankfully, she found an inspirational website that brought her back from the brink.  But, she says her le could have panned out very dferentlyshed discovered similar material to teenager Molly Russell. The -year-old died in  - and her dad Ian believes Instagram is partly responsible - because he found distressing material about depression and suicide on her account. Natasha, who suffered domestic abuse as a child, said: I’d reached a point where I just felt I couldn’t do this anymore. I began to look up ways to die painlessly because I was in enough pain as it was.   “If I could die painlessly, at least I could say some part of my le wasn’t painful. Then I found a page online that said ‘You’re obviously very down but why not start from scratch again, start a fresh new le  It felt like an awakening for me. Thankfully, I didnt get what I was looking for online. But,Id found what Molly had been looking at, who knows what might have happened. I might not be here talking about this now. Now Health Secretary Matt Hancock has written to Facebook - which owns Instagram, as well as Twitter and Google, telling them they have a duty to act. Read more of Natashas story here Today, Natasha runs Free Your Mind CIC , a child domestic violence and mental heath support, awareness and support service.She meets young people every day who are struggling with what they see on social media.  Another le has been lost and that is horrible, said Natasha, who was once a size  due to comfort eating.When social media was created, this is not what it was meant for - its turned into this monster, and its a real concern.People have access to other people in a way thats not normal. Everyone is contactable in the blink of a text or direct message.  They can post the most hateful, disturbing material and theres no censorship. There are posts on how to starve yourself, how to end your le and they are not taken down. There are actually Instagram posts encouraging people to keep on starving themselves and tips on how to do it. It makes me really annoyed. Thats why we get tragic results like this.Natasha believes social media has a much more powerful effect on young people today than it did when she was at her lowest ebb in . Social media is so much bigger than it was just a few years ago, said Natasha, who now lives in London. Im very glad I made my search then rather than now. I think people are really influenced by what they see. I remember back then a tweet from someone about me would send me reeling. My sister is  and she comes home upset about something but she wont let us do anything about it as she doesnt want any backlash. Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, has called on Facebook , YouTube, Pinterest and Snapchat to back a statutory duty of care to take more responsibility for what children are able to access online.She is also calling for a digital ombudsman to act as an independent arbiter between the s and their users in the wake of the Molly Russell case.Natasha wrote to Instagram saying much the same thing a couple of years ago. I wrote to Instagram a while ago, saying they had a responsibility to these people to take down certain posts and asking what is the process behind that  said Natasha, .  Because they do take down other posts that are much less of a danger so they do monitor whats going on but they leave these damaging posts. It makes no sense. But I didnt get a response. I said it could result in a loss of le and now it has. I should think its happened before but we just dont hear about it. Natasha launched a blog called Free Your Mind in  then wrote a book about her journey, which featured the stories of others too. She has since hosted lots of fundraising events, such as K Free Your Mind runs and #Loveback days when she and her team have pounded the streets of London raising awareness and giving out free hugs. Free Your Mind offers one to one and online support, workshops, school talks and has just launched a support centre. Social media is such a big thing for many young people today, she added.  My sister locks herself away and spends hours just skimming through Instagram. Its just the way a lot of young people are now. Even when a young person is sat talking to me, they find it hard to go cold turkey without their phone for an hour. I see them sneakily grabbing it to have a look under the table, just so they dont miss a trick. This is where everything is for that generation - their friends, music, TV - and it means theyre very much tied to them, living their social lives through their phones. It results in comparison issues. I work really hard to say to young people thatyou are always looking at what other people are doing, you can never be present in your own le. Youll never enjoy your leyoure so busy looking at others peoples. And people always put up their best le on social media - you have to realise there is another le behind that photo. Its hard for some young people to see that because this world is their reality. She added: People like to have lots of friends and followers on social media but thats like going outside to meet all your friends all at once. Its hard to keep up with it. And its not normal. If all your social media friends turned up outside your house youd be horried. Its a really strange reality. Nobodys got time to keep up with that many people. Theres so much pressure. People make and break friends on social media. At work, I see people cry on a daily basis, it shows how much people are holding stuff in. Ill have seen their social media posts and they look happy and smiling, and here they are in my office crying their eyes out. Its not being honest about whats happening and I think theres a lack of being honest with yourself these days just to project that image to other people. It makes no sense.Find out more about Free Your Mind CIC hereIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available   by calling   or by emailing jo@samaritans.org "},{"url":null,"title":"mum heard screaming my baby","story":"NewsMum heard screaming my baby as one-year-old died after being left in hot carThe tragedy happened in Sydney, Australia, after the boy was left with his grandmother, according to reportsShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  FEB NewsPolice are investigating the death of a one-year-old boy \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA devastated mum screamed my baby as she learned her one-year-old son had died after being left in a hot car.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.

Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS. But this was the wrong letter . . . to the wrong people . . . on the wrong day.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Kenny added: “We’ve seen an appetite in the industry for more cool and modern pubs and, similarly to our T-Bar in Ayr, Vic’s will be a traditional bar with a twist. “This will both suit the local market and sit alongside our excellent new restaurant offering in Prestwick. “Our vision is to create the best day-to-night venue in Scotland and we are confident Vic’s  The Vine will match those expectations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPrestwickAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"former royal hotel ayr sold","story":"NewsFormer Royal Hotel in Ayr is sold at auctionBuilding is branded the most dangerous in the townShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB NewsRoyal Hotel Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe former Royal Hotel, which has been described as the most dangerous building in Ayr, has been sold at auction.

But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window.

They have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.,params: .pushHowever, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott felt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper. I appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion. People have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Mr Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in , % of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and % were at risk of becoming obese.

at a choice of two new timetable models: Monday to Friday with seven periods, giving  periods a week or three days a week with seven periods and two days a week with six, giving  periods a week.At the moment, there are  periods a week.In addition to the timetable change, S and S students will maximise their time in school instead of being able to #sign out#.Pupils will be encouraged to study additional subjects, assist junior students in class, and volunteer in the community to gain Saltire Awards.Special arrangements will still be possible to enable other wider achievements such as gaining a driving licence.Mr Fyfe said: #We want our young people to make the best use of their time at school and gain valuable experiences which will benefit them when they leave.#S and S pupils will soon be required to give their initial option choices to allow the school to judge demand for each subject, although these will not be final.Mr Fyfe also shared the results of a parents and partners survey on the school#s visions and values and #rights respecting schools# charter.He said: #So far we have had  responses but there is still time for you to let us hear your views.#We really value input from parents so it is vital that as many people as possible come forward and make their opinions known.#The survey showed that . per cent of parents felt that the school#s aims, outlined in last week#s Courier, either fully capture what is important to the school, or capture it well.The survey also found, however, that . per cent of those who responded felt that they had #not been involved at all# with the development of the school#s vision and values, while . per cent felt they had not been involved in the development of the new curriculum.#That is what these consultations are about,# Mr Fyfe said, #these figures can certainly be improved but onlymore people take part.#The survey on changes to the structure of the curriculum and school day is open until February  and people

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

I marvelled at the food that came out through that impossibly cramped serving place on the ground floor and envisaged a kitchen hotter than Tabasco, either behind or below, filled with world travellers who knew genuine Mexican food and were capable of serving up a respectful representation of it.Now the second El Cartel in Teviot Place, haunt of students, has left me wondering was the original El Cartel actually not as good as I remember, or is this one letting it down  A quick straw poll of those who accompanied me on El Cartel trips suggests the latter.Where the original El Cartel was electric, exciting, this one is monotonous, mundane. Itrsquos asits vivacity has been replaced by a tick box exercise, the dutul copying of the inspiring original dishes, gradually losing most of its sparkle in the process. Like Chinese Whispers, El Cartelrsquos founding message has become distorted somewhat in the telling.Guacamole, I used to think it quite special at El Cartel, is missing several tricks. Its greenness has an unpleasantly all-pervasive onion undertow, and is, by my standards, underpowered on lime, coriander and chilli. By the way, no need to order it as a dish because it turns up over and over again in other dishes, as does tedious shredded Chinese cabbage.Our pick of the daily specials, a vegetarian taco based on squash, sets the tone. The sweet vegetable is partnered with eye-wateringly vinegary pickled onions mixed with a brown salsa that might possibly have a connection with chocolate, but with bossy cinnamon in overdrive and enough chilli- and I like a lot of chilli- to ride rampantly over other flavours and reduce them to mere textures. Itrsquos one of those peppery chillis that sets up residence on the back of your tongue. I take a big slug of my rather medicinal lime Margarita and am grateful for it, even though it leaves freezer burn on my lips.Al Pastor pork ribs manage to be dull, with a lingering taste I associate with reheating. Theyrsquore in ldquocumin, garlic and pineapple glaze, a furiously fiery, fruity coating that makes us sweat and clocks in too high up the sweetness scale, but yet it canrsquot quite cover an underlying bitterness that Irsquom not actively relishing. Cashew and cabbage slaw accompanies it, but its dressing is also too sweet.We fancy a clean, refreshing ceviche, but the only fish getting this treatment is salmon, presumably farmed, which I never eat on environmental grounds. So itrsquos more meat, this time carne asado, flash-grilled flat iron steak, slicked with a salsa of grassy, slightly acidic Arbol chillis, avocado, spring onion.The tacos here are flexibly flabby, irregularly formed, hand pressed in-house daily using proper Masa Harina corn meal. Theyrsquore one of the best things about El Cartel. Duck carnitas are probably the star dish, fatty, crisp-skinned mouthfuls lightened with pineapple, brightened by hot Jalapentildeo chillis, everything calmed down by an emollient pecan salsa.On paper, this second El Cartel definitely outshines the original one.

For a whole  days. Or  mealsyou want it in terms your stomach can understand.Founded by Jane Land and Matthew Glover in , Veganuary launched in  with  pledgers and that number has at least doubled every year. Last year , people took part and to date there have been a quarter of a million participants in  countries. Pointing to a poll by IPSOS Mori about actual take-up, the organisers have also identied what they call ldquothe Veganuary Effect, which suggests that around  times that number take part without signing the pledge.The core principles turn on animal welfare and always have. As well as campaigning against killing animals and fish, vegan organisations, pressure groups and activists have long fought to shine a light on the more unsavoury practices of the dairy and egg-production industries.Those issues remain valid but increasingly veganism is becoming an attractive proposition for those concerned with other subjects, from the environment and ecological sustainability to allergies, food additives and gut microbes. Itrsquos that which in large part is accounting for the rise in veganism. Moreover, while discussions of veganism have always taken in theology, philosophy and politics therersquos now a feminist angleand pop culture is coming around, too. Alert vegans enjoying Oscar-nominated superhero blockbuster Black Panther wonrsquot have missed the line about how the Jabari tribe are vegetarian ndash but those who did because they were too busy looking at the phones probably already know that mega-influencers Ellie Goulding, Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande, who have a cool  million Instagram followers between them, are vegan.Figures for the number of pledgers singing up to the  Veganuary campaign were announced last week and reveal that , people signed up, making it the most popular ever. Adjusted for the Veganuary Effect that means a cool two and a half million people around the world may have tried veganism for the first time last month.Kay Steven was one of them. A part-time student who lives in Edinburgh and runs a consultancy business, she took the Veganuary pledge. ldquoIt took two friends signing up to Veganuary to give me the push to do it. Irsquove been pleasantly surprised at how easy Irsquove found it and how much support Irsquove had from friends and family.For Rich Hardy, Veganuaryrsquos Head of Campaigns, that sort of testimony shows that veganism has shaken off its reputation as a sort of culinary counter-culture and gone mainstream.ldquolsquoVeganrsquo is now a word we see and hear everywhere ndash in shops and restaurants, in peoplersquos conversations on the streets, and in newspapers and magazines, he says. ldquoItrsquos not hype or a short-term trend. Any movement has to reach critical mass to succeed. We think veganism has reached that point and is firmly on its way to the mainstream.Social media and smartphones have helped spread the message, he adds. ldquoAll of us can view footage of an undercover animal rights exposeacutewe so choose. With material like that so available, itrsquos helped get more people questioning whatrsquos been hidden from them.The mainstream has certainly taken notice. Last month restaurant chain TGI Fridays launched its ldquobleeding vegan burger. Not in the best taste, perhaps, but the oozing blood came from the addition of beetroot and the rest of the burger was formed from a mixture of coconut oil, mushrooms, herbs and spices. Last week, pizza chain Papa Johnrsquos launched three new pizzas featuring Sheese, a vegan cheese manufactured by Rothesays Bute Island Foods. And even McDonalds has muscled in with a Spicy Veggie Patty and a vegan-friendly Happy Meal.Therersquos no doubting the pace of change. Research by The Vegan Society in  found that just over half a million Britons described themselves as vegan and research two years later found the number had surged to three and a half million. In Scotland, according to  figures, there are , vegans, about twice the population of Dundee.No doubt some of them even live there, but itrsquos Edinburgh and Glasgow that are at the centre of the scene here. Edinburgh punches well above its weight.

With three other new vegan cafes operating just a couple of minutesrsquo walk from the Hug, as itrsquos known, co-owner and co-founder Colin Campbell is in no doubt the cityrsquos vegan scene is thriving.

They already run a brunch service there but now evening diners can enjoy dishes such as Jackfruit Curry or Sweet Soy and Coconut Tempeh. Theyrsquore also in the process of writing a Hug And Pint vegan cook book.Leaving aside the issue of morality and animal welfare, one complaint against veganism is that the palette of available foodstuffs is necessarily limited. But Campbell flips that idea on its head. To him, those arenrsquot limitations at all. The beauty of vegan fare, he thinks, is that ldquoitrsquos food thatrsquos suitable for everyone. Itrsquos the widest, most accessible menu we can do. If yoursquore a meat eater you can eat it,yoursquore vegetarian you can eat it,yoursquore vegan you can eat it.So why does he think the popularity of veganism is on the rise  ldquoI think itrsquos linked into a wider discussion, he says. ldquoItrsquos about things like the environment, thatrsquos a big thing for me and a big thing for people who arenrsquot maybe fully vegan or fully vegetarian but who are reducetarian.Vicky Allan: We build this future on sausage rolls Remember that word. Championed by the US-based Reducetarian Foundation, it promotes eating less meat, dairy and eggs but values pragmatism over an all-or-nothing approach. In other words you can still have full fat milk in your tea and, yes, the occasional bacon roll or plate of mince and tatties. The Foundation hosts at annual Reducetarian Summit , publishes a cookbook and like Veganuary asks potential converts to take a pledge. Options ranging from going meat-free on Mondays to becoming vegetarian for a month.Edinburgh has a less vibrant vegan cafeacute-bar scene than Glasgow, but it does have two of Scotlandrsquos oldest and most venerable vegetarian eateries in Hendersons, established in , and David Bann, founded in the mid-s.David Bann started out with a baked potato shop in the early s and his eponymous restaurant has been in St Maryrsquos Street in the Old Town since . Veganism ldquodoes seem to have gone mainstream, he says. ldquoWe get a lot more enquiries for it than we used to. Wersquove always had vegan options on our menu but recently wersquove been getting a lot more enquiries from vegan customers, so wersquore putting a little bit more emphasis on that.

But, he adds, ldquoI donrsquot like to put food on that only vegans will like. Itrsquos important to me that everyone will enjoy it. The important thing is for the food to have mainstream appeal. ldquoPeople who would normally eat meat have to enjoy what they have here and itrsquos exactly the same with vegan food.Bann is vegetarian and has been serving vegetarian and vegan food to Edinburghers for a quarter of a century. But even he thinks itrsquos too early to saythe rise in veganism and the increased awareness around environmental sustainability, animal welfare and food production are a short-live trend or show a cultural and societal sht.ldquoThe recent upsurge might be a fad, but I would like to think itrsquos a direction of travel, he says. ldquoI think it would be a healthy way to go. A lot of people are not going totally vegan but theyrsquore looking for more vegan options. Most of our customers are not even vegetarian but theyrsquore eating less meat and they want to try dferent things. And I think the same thing is happening with vegan food: people are more open to it.Bannrsquos restaurant manager, Ruben Iglesias, came to Scotland from Spain  years ago and became vegan two years after arriving. He has seen veganism move from the fringes to commonplace lestyle choice. He agrees that social media and the internet has much to do with the increase in and acceptance of veganism, and like Bann he has seen the proof of it in the number of vegans coming into the restaurant.When Iglesias started at the restaurant in , vegan customers were uncommon. ldquoYou might get two or three an evening, he says. ldquoNow Irsquod say at least  per cent of our customers are vegan. Wersquove always been able to adapt the menu to be vegan but at some points last year  per cent of our menu was vegan, or we could adapt it to be vegan.Heres the big question, though: how many of those who sign up to Veganuary will still be off meat, fish, eggs and dairy come Shrove Tuesday which, as the pancake lovers among you will know, falls on March  this year ldquoWersquoll need a few yearsrsquo more data to get a better feel about the longer term conversion rates of people taking the pledge and remaining vegan, says Simon Winch, Veganuaryrsquos CEO. ldquoBut the signs are very encouraging that the campaign is really effective at helping people stay vegan for the long term.For her part, Kay Steven is aiming to at least make it to Pancake Day. ldquoIt feels lovely to have made the leap and Irsquom planning on keeping going for at least another few months, but to be honest I canrsquot imagine going back. Irsquom definitely feeling healthier and not deprived in the slightest.So is the future vegan ndash or will it only look like it every time Veganuary rolls around ldquoI wouldnrsquot go as far as to say itrsquos the future, says David Bann. ldquoBut I think it is another cuisine that is opening peoplersquos minds a little bit to what is available, and it just gives people another option so they can steer away from meat for a while. Irsquove never had the idea of changing the world, I just want to give people the option of something dferent from what they were brought up with or what theyrsquore used to.

The comforting creaminess of cashews is countered with sharp and fiery sambal oelek and balanced with the freshness of peas and coriander. Inspired by classic Indo-British cuisine, this curry has widespread appeal and is one of our most enduring and popular dishes, appearing fairly consistently on our rotating menu.Serves Serve with: rice and or flatbreadIngredientsg cashew nuts g button mushrooms dried shiitake mushroomsml vegetable oilg frozen peasA small handful coriander leaves  medium brown onion  green chillies  cloves of garlic  thumb of ginger  tablespoon of palm sugar or brown sugar teaspoon ground coriander teaspoon ground turmeric teaspoon ground cuminA pinch of ground cardamomA pinch of ground fenugreek tablespoon of salt fresh curry leaves  tablespoon sambal oelek The juice of  limeMethodIn a bowl, cover the dried shiitake in ml of hot water and leave to soak for one hour. Meanwhile, in a food processor or a large pestle and mortar, blitz the onions, garlic, chillies and ginger, adding a little of the oil to achieve a thick paste consistency. Heat the majority of the rest of the oil in a large saucepan. When hot but not smoking, add the paste and cook, stirring often, for  minutes until it softens and gets some colour. In a frying pan or wok, heat a glug of oil and fry the button mushrooms in two batches until each batch is well coloured all over. It helps to keep the mushrooms a similar size, so cut any larger ones in half, keeping the smaller ones whole. When the mushrooms are cooked, using the same pan cook half of the cashews over a medium heat until brown, being careful not to burn them. In a food processor blitz the remaining uncooked cashews with ml of water and ml of vegetable oil into a smooth, white butter and set aside. Add the spices, sugar and salt to the onion garlic paste and cook for another  minutes, adding oilit seems dry. Remove the shiitake from the soaking water and reserve the liquid. Remove stalks and discard, roughly chop caps and add to the cooking paste. Add the soaking water, cashew butter and sambal oelek to the cooking paste and stir.

Whisky and beer, of course, gin ndash a relatively new product thats gaining a global reputation ndash and then theres the cider, and the vodka, and the wine. And, just when you think youre getting a bit too spoilt for choice, Scottish rum rears its head.Its enough to make your head spin.In , the Scottish drinks industry has never been in a better place, racking up a string of record-breaking successes in the last decade.The brewing sector has increased by % since , according to a paper published in October by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre . This boost was mainly driven by micro-breweries, which represent % of Scotlands brewing business base.The same survey found that distilling-related ventures have grown by % since  and now number . The growth doesnt seem to be slowing either, with new distilleries apparently popping up like mushrooms after a rain shower.Leading the boom both at home and abroad is, unsurprisingly, the king of them all ndash whisky. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, in  the value of exports reached a record pound. billion, representing % of all UK food and drink exports.The main Scotch whisky export destinations by value are the USA , France , Singapore , Germany and Spain. India is in the top three in terms of volume of product imported, after France and the USA.It might surprise you to know that the United Kingdom wins is the worldrsquos largest exporter of spirit ... and % of that success is due to Scotch whisky.And one of the by-products of that success is now developing a global reputation in its own right.Over the past few years, a string new whisky distilleries have opened, keen to cash in on the earning power of Scotch whisky. There was only one problem ndash the spirit must me aged in oak casks for at least three years before it can even be called whisky, and most fans wont even look at it until its  or  years old.This creates some obvious cash-flow problems for the new ventures so, to keep the money coming in while they waited, many began producing gin, which can be bottled and sold on the day it is distilled. Many of these brands have gone global ndash think Harris gin and Eden Mill - and have added an extra impressive bow to Scotlands drink credentials.Although England holds a higher count of gin distilleries, it is estimated that around two-thirds of UK gin is made in Scotland, and there are around  gin distilleries north of the Border.To put that into perspective, there are  whisky distilleries.This golden period for Scotlands drink industry may have its roots in the traditions of whisky and beer, but as its expertise expands into other areas it is developing a reputation to rival global drinks giants such as the US or other European countries, in a way that only a few years ago could never have been imagined.But can Scotland be considered a superpower on the international drinking scene Distill gameScotlands whisky industry boasts some of the best-loved drinks brands in the world, and new distilleries are at ious stages of growth all over the country.For instance, later this year, Ardnahoe ndash the latest distillery on Islay ndash is expected to begin production. Glasgow distillery, which released its first single malt last June, should complete a further expansion plan by the end of the year, and crowdfunding has just started for a new distillery on Barra.However, while traditional whisky is, as ever, leading the way, innovation and experimentation are driving a new wave of growth. Aqua Vitae and the Lindores Abbey distillery is a case in point.In Edinburgh, Port of Leith Distillery is ringing the changes with more than its alcohol. Its Lind  Lime Gin is being made at its Tower Street Stillhouse ndash the first vertical distillery which wants to become a centre for research, innovation and learning.ldquoOur country is very lucky right now to have Scotch whisky. Its the worldrsquos premium spirit but there is no reason to suppose that this will continue for decades to come,\" said Port of Leith co-founder, Ian Stirling.ldquoOther countries are stealing a march in terms of exciting products that are being created. We think that itrsquos for everyonersquos benefit for the industry that Scotland remains an exciting place and, yes, we have a wonderful heritage to back look upon, but we need continue innovating to create excitement and for the eyes to look back at Scotland for something new and exciting.According to Ian, the Scotch whisky industry, however successful, faces a ldquogenerational sht and has to pace up with realities around the world:ldquoGoing back  years, when Paddy and I were first engaged with whisky, everything that was exciting in the whisky world was happening outside of Scotland. Some distillers here were doing interesting things, but the majority of excitement was in America, South East Asia, Australia.ldquoWhat we need is to see the same vibrance in Scotch whisky as we see in the other sectors, which is a huge challenge.The distillery received funding to create a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with world-renowned Heriot-Watt International Centre for Brewing and Distillingto develop a research scheme that will focus on fermentation and yeasts, but that will also allow the transfer of knowledge to students from the institute and, at the same time, nurturing and having access to skilled workforce on their doorstep.Sharing the knowledgeScotland has traditionally been a hub for people seeking to learn more about the national drink, in turn expanding the scope of Scottish influence abroad in the drinks industry. One notable example is the fathers of Japanese whisky, Mazataka Taketsuru and Shijiro Torii.The tradition lives on and Edinburgh is home to one of the industrys most important education centres worldwide ndash the ICBD at Heriot-Watt University. Providing the worldrsquos only degree in brewing and distilling , it attracts students from all over the world ndash especially for its postgraduate courses, also available as distance learning.Javin Chia, , from Singapore is a third-year undergraduate student in brewing and distilling. He was a home brewer and worked for the industry in his home country before moving to Scotland for study.ldquoHeriot-Watt was recommended to me by one of the guys who used to brew beer back in Singapore. He told me that it was a really good course: from the moment he graduated he was never out of the job, as this degree is highly regarded.ldquoThere are many people in the brewing and whisky industry who have done this particular course. I once met Shinji Fukuyo, master blender for Suntory [a Japanese drinks giant], and he told me he graduated from it, which really surprised me. This shows you the reputability it has.Javin has experienced the effect of the Scottish alcohol industry surge: ldquoSingapore had one of the highest growths in whisky imports in the last few years, and not because everyone drinks ndash Singapore is quite a small country, but it has become one of the most important distribution spots for South-East Asia. We have a lot of good specialist bars and people who are really passionate about whisky.ldquoGin is becoming very popular as well, brands like the Botanist are well known ndash and Brewdog, for craft beers. They are the ones who converted me to craft beer!High HopsBeyond distillation, Scotland excels on a global scale in the production of beer, and the intention is for it to grow even further. In December, Scotland Food and Drink published an industry strategy that aims to make Scottish brewing a pound billion industry by , allowing the creation of new jobs all over the country.Hilary Jones, chair of the Brewing Industry Leadership Group ndash in charge of the research on which the report is based ndash explained: ldquoIf you look back to less than two centuries ago, Scotland was one of the few great brewing nations. We were inventive, bringing technologists and chemists into our breweries.\"We created new beer types and brewed Porters, Stouts, IPAs and small batch beers, added botanicals and flavourings. We exported to the USA, Asia, Australia and Africa. Scotland now has over  operating breweries supporting over , jobs.\"Even though we have an unrivalled track record producing great beer and centuries of history behind us, the rising popularity of global craft beer means that Scotland needs to sharpen its gameit is to remain an international leader.Scotland has had a number of global brewing successes, especially in the realm of craft beers. Innis  Gunn and Stewart Brewing boast Scottish products that appear all over the world.However, the company that truly brought Scotland to the world stage in craft brewing is Brewdog. Founded in  in Ellon by James Watt and Martin Dickies, itrsquos now exported to more than  countries, has premises all over the world and has been listed in the Sunday Times Fast Track  for six years running.Its innovative approach to both production and business expansion has been a role model for the whole craft beer scene in the last few years. In  it started a new adventure with LoneWolf, expanding to the spirits scene ndash launching experimental products with vodkas, gins and whiskies at the core of their production.The futureThe expansion in Scotlands alcohol industry in the last decade has been incredibly fast and erse, and has brought global attention to the quality of production and the quest for innovation. But to stay ahead of the pack, there are many challenges to be addressed.Huge work has been done to give legal protection for the Scottish name and the provenance of its products, and to ensure the highest standards of production are met, but with other countries often throwing away the rule books and fully embraced new ideas, its important sure rules are not too rigid and producers are able to experiment and focus on research.In addition, the image of Scotlands premium products must not be allowed to stagnate. Drinks such as craft beer and gin are attracting younger fans, while Scotch whisky is often seen as a drink for older men.Its price tag ndash often unaffordable for younger drinkers ndash and its image for stuffy tradition can make it feel like the fuddy-duddy older cousin of new products such as gin and craft beer, where experimentation and fun are making the products feel fresh and accessible.There was a day, no so long ago, when beer suffered a similar image problem, but all it took was some creative thinking, some products of serious quality and innovative producers like Brewdog and a global transformation began.There is no doubt that, across the drinks industry in Scotland, the quality is there. Were still a world leader, and pass on our expertise to new generations of brewers and distillers all over the world.While a commitment to tradition will always be essential, whether the Scotland keeps its place at the top table of the global drinks industry will surely depend on whether it can take its own advice and push its own boundaries."},{"url":null,"title":"government-money-to-help-deliver-eight-new-works-by-eight-scottish-composers","story":"AS this yearrsquos excellent Celtic Connections Festival draws to a close, itrsquos timely to reflect on the benefits of such a ied and exciting cultural calendar in Scotland.Festivals and events bring people together.

The Festival brings talented Scottish artists with those from overseas across a range of genres of music together in a celebration of culture and music that transcends borders. Celtic Connections enables us to enhance our strong cultural relationships with other nations by increasing our understanding of each other through creative expression and traditions.We only need to look at the recent tourism statistics to see, tourists are still flocking to Scotland to see our beautul country.No doubt many of these tourists are engaging with our culture by attending a festival, whether it be warming up at a cosy Celtic Connections folk show in the depths of the Glasgow winter, or dancing through Edinburgh in the summer sun at a silent disco.It is during these uncertain times that the power of culture and the arts illustrate how we can come together and project Scotland as an inclusive and outward looking nation. It is essential that we support these efforts to ensure international visitors continue to choose Scotland as their preferred destination.We all benefit from a thriving cultural calendar that showcases our nation. The UK Governmentsrsquo plan to leave the EU is a threat to our cultural calendar and global reputation as an outward-looking nation.

He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it special, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its romantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that, as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland.ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the warrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of myth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it.

As well as adding the famous footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, the castle itself was restored to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae, has a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the clans long association with the fortress: ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies had lost control of Eilean Donan in the first half of the th century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in a purported Royal Charter of  ndash which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenzies power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion, which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the glen near the castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis of Seaforth, played a heroic role in this rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"happy-birthday-facebook-or-is-it","story":"The back story is as rich and seemingly as unlikely as a movie script and was the nub of the narrative in the  Oscar-winning film The Social Network.It all began in  when Mark Zuckerberg and friends created an online programme called Facemash in a dorm room in Kirkland House on the Hard campus.It was created as a  to connect students,only to rate each otherrsquos attractiveness, and Zuckerberg almost faced expulsion.

I thought lsquoyou cannot have a paper like this, talking about gay people like that.ldquoDue to Section  [brought in ] a lot of people were very politicised about lesbian and gay rights and how we were seen.ldquoWhen I moved to Glasgow in  I was amazed as there was very little visibility. There were certainly things going on below the surface and people doing some amazing work, but it was largely invisible. I found it strange and thought there had to be something we could do.ldquoI thought it wasnrsquot fair. We wanted to make the argument that we pay our taxes and we disproportionately contribute to the arts, so itrsquos about time we had something for, and about, us as well.Cordelia teamed up with freelance arts administrator Dominic DrsquoAngelo and put on the first Glasgay! in , with more than  events running between October  and November .However funding, which was a long-running issue for the event over its  years, forced a blackout in  and again in  before the organisers stepped down and a new team took over.Steven Thomson, producer from  until , said his focus was on not only curating a festival but commissioning artists who were under-represented.He said: ldquoIn  we had got this award from an American travel guide which listed Glasgow as the fourth top gay destination in the world. There were people in the world looking at what we were doing and they thought it was great. There was, however, constant backlash on our own doorstep.ldquoWe still had the camp stereotypes of Julian Clarey mincing about on TV or Gimme Gimme Gimme where there was constant boyfriend issues.ldquoI recognised I had to change that.

Civil partnerships for same-sex couples was legalised in , and same-sex marriages were approved in .The TIE campaign, which has successfully campaigned for LGBT issues to be taught in Scottish schools, was just getting off the ground following the Independence Referendum in September .However, with austerity cuts, the festival failed to secure long-term funding in  and was forced to close.

Although all things from ants to elephants hear vastly dfering frequencies, the objective reality of sound existed long before sensory organs evolved to detect it. Trees will continue to fall with a crack and thud long after our brief, torrid stewardship of this planet is over.Yet, whatthe person who observed that falling tree lacked the ability to form memories  Certainly, theyrsquod have no frame of reference to comprehend a tree. And without memory, stuck inside an eternal millisecond, that person would also have zero awareness of their own conciousness. Time would simply cease to exist, melting away like a Dali clock. A perceivable reality would simply not exist. Le would be indistinguishable from death. No trees would ever fall.Itrsquos a truth staggering in its obviousness. That each creature on this planet ndash in the universe, perhaps ndash is only able to exist,and evolve due to their brainrsquos ability to store information. And thanks to a revelatory new discovery, many scientists now believe cerebral stickiness didnrsquot actually co-evolve with the brain, as once presumed.It now looks likely that all consciousness is simply the result of an ancient viral infection ndash one we, thankfully, canrsquot shake off. And although this mysterious affliction remains incurable, it is no longer undetectable.Great story, ArcGENETICISTS recently studying lsquoArcrsquondash a gene active within our neurons and understood to be responsible for forming and retaining memory ndash werenrsquot quite prepared for what they discovered. It seems special proteins created by Arc do something astonishing ndash they shape themselves into the unmistakable Hellraiser ldquoPinhead shape of a virus.The genetic evidence strongly suggests this mysterious organism first infected a common ancestor of ours around  million years ago and, apparently, completely altered its primitive brain.By transmitting genetic code through its RNA, the virus actually gave this pre-dinosaur organism and its descendants the same gt I got on Christmas morning  on VHS ndash Total Recall. Over millions of years, this new ability gave rise to consciousness itself. And, eventually, you and I.Itrsquos certainly a disturbing and novel spin on the origin of our acute self-awareness, perhaps confirming once and for all that we are not sospecial as a species. Itrsquos quite likely we are simply durable skin bags, built by nature to safely incubate and transport viruses. If we are indeed just drone mules gted a small degree of universal awareness by the viral occupants of our brains, at least we mutually benefit by such co-dependence by being aware of our three score and ten blink-in-the-eye-of-infinity wee existences.Itrsquos certainly unarguable that the evolutionary advantage of being able to form memories eventually led some curious apes to launch steel phalluses towards the moon ndash and also creating the medium yoursquore reading these words on. It also allowed these apes to work out they were on a spherical rock that was spinning around a nuclear furnace in the middle of infinity.That said, itrsquos possible that human scientic endeavour itself is simply the ancient virus attempting to understand itself by evolving brains of the organisms it has infected. It did come first, after all.An enlightened voiceIF memory is indeed a virus, what does this mean for we egotistical humans who have historically believed ourselves a cut above the rest of the species on this planet  Certainly, many enlightened members of our tribe have tried to tell us over the years that the miracle of memory is key to solving the mysteries of consciousness and the human condition.The first known study of memory was Aristotlersquos treatise ldquoOn The Soul, the title of which might also be the first known instance of irony. The philosopherrsquos then-heretical musings suggested wehumans are simply blank slates, not animated by any magical eternal soul, there was no afterle and we are simply the sum of our experiences. Aristotle wasnrsquot invited to many parties.Although countless philosophers and intellectuals have come and gone since his death  years ago, few humans have advanced Aristotlersquos studious musings on the enigma of memory and true nature of reality more than Irish singer Daniel OrsquoDonnell.Although his work is often dismissed by accepted mainstream perception as offensively featherweight easy-listening, serious academic study of OrsquoDonnellrsquos remarkable oeuvre exposes a rich wealth of philosophical truisms and florid accounts of how memory has the power to set us free yet, ultimately, cages us.On record, the Irishmanrsquos towering intellect and acute sensitivity to the human condition hides in plain sight. Perhaps only upon his passing will be realise we were blessed to exist in the same spacetime as this scientist of the human heart ndash one who dedicated his le to exploring the enigma of memory.ldquoRemember Yoursquore Mine, ldquoRemember Me, ldquoLast Thing On My Mind, ldquoDonrsquot Forget to Remember and the ingenious ldquoI Forgot To Remember To Forget are clearly all evergreen roadmaps for the soul, yet, such an obvious obsession with memory suggests that the Arc gene may be stronger in luminaries such as OrsquoDonnell and Aristotle than the rest of us ndash the virus perhaps using such enlightened vessels to elevate the entire human collective consciousness and evolve us all into transdimensional orbs madeof pure light.Perhaps instead of a tree falling, the classic thought experiment should ask: does a Daniel OrsquoDonnell album make a soundno-one is around to hear it play  And, this time, the answer would certainly be no.For surely, only human ears could ever empathise with the great truths exposed by OrsquoDonnell, whose entire -album body of work exists as one long bittersweet ode to mortality and the imprint of memories upon our finite existence. The singer often falls back upon the truism that wersquore only truly gone when those who remember us die themselves, but therersquos surely room within OrsquoDonnellrsquos defiant optimism to also consider one other possibilty ndash that the immortal virus that granted us conciousness may also be capable of remembering its long lineage of mortal hosts. And thus, we live on forever.And finally ...APPLICATION of the scientic method may not always be immediately apparent within OrsquoDonnellrsquos lyrics, yet repeated listening reveals an abiding obsession with the processes of the natural world. His hymn to the epic scope of geological time, ldquoMy Donegal Shore perfectly illustrates this infatuation, an evocative work inspired by the wealth of ancient bioersity on the western Irish coastline, where the Atlantic has thrown up many exotic fossils, flora and fauna.That OrsquoDonnell has found a meeting point between intellectual prowess and strong religious faith is to his credit. Not many believers in ine creation are sympathetic to suggestions that their inner worlds are simply illusions projected by a  million year old virus burrowed deep inside their brains.Yet, mere secular laymen can perhaps never truly understand what quells the contradictions warring within such a unique, quicksilver mind as OrsquoDonnellrsquos.All answers are perhaps found within the work itself, abundant with analogy for OrsquoDonnellrsquos highwire balancing act on the tightrope between faith and science.Certainly, ldquoThe Time That God Sends lends itself better to a chorus than ldquoA Prehistoric Virus Infected Us With A Limited Frequency Of Consciousness Within A Finite Slice Of Spacetime.Follow Bill on Twitter: futureshockbb"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9373130.jpg?type=article-full","title":"no-financial-deal-for-scotlands-declining-oil-gas-industry-without-detailed-climate-change-plan-say-mps","story":"A report published today by the Scottish Affairs Committee recommends that the poundm industry and government partnership deal should be supported to ensure that Scotlandrsquos oil and gas industry can \"navigate the challenges of its future and continue to prosper\".The highlight of the deal involves the creation of new centres of excellence, one of which has just opened near Aberdeen.

The home has strong links to the ldquoScottish Enlightenment, as the Dalrymples were patrons, providing support to scholars who were drawn to the Housersquos library, including philosopher and economist Adam Smith.Highlights include the magnicent dining room, impressive Italian marble fireplaces and th-century trompe lrsquooeil decoration in the Chinese sitting room.But in , staff noticed a sharp rise in the ldquowebbing clothes moth ndash or common clothes moth ndash and have been endeavouring to manage the problem with localised treatment and targeted deep cleaning ever since.However, moth numbers ndash and damage ndash have continued and the organisation is implementing the freeze programme to protect the Newhailes collection.The charity has used freezers to destroy moths at other properties in the past, but on a small scale using chest-sized freezers.The two, ft long freezers that are being deployed at Newhailes represent the organisationrsquos biggest ever attempt to keep moth numbers down.Mel Houston, national preventive conservator at the NTS, said: ldquoThis is the biggest project that the National Trust for Scotland has ever undertaken to tackle a pest problem like this and protect the important collections here at Newhailes.ldquoIn the last year moth numbers at Newhailes have exploded and wersquove seen a four-fold increase in how many wersquore finding.ldquoWersquore lucky to have been able to catch the problem at just the right time, when wersquore able to do something to control the moths before really serious damage is done.ldquoThe deep freeze and deep clean gives us the confidence wersquore killing off as many moths as we can. Wersquoll never get rid of them completely but wersquoll be able to get down to the level where they can be controlled.A team of mothbusting volunteers has now been recruited to work with the Trustrsquos collection and conservation team to undertake the low temperature treatment, deep cleaning of the historic interior and collection movements.During the project, the NTS will also be running tours so the public can learn about the damage the insects have caused and see the moth management programme in action.A spokeswoman said: ldquoThe Moth Project offers visitors a unique opportunity to view the house in a dferent context and understand the conservation work undertaken to preserve the historic collection and interior.ldquoA team of volunteers will be working with our collection and conservation team to undertake the collectionrsquos low temperature treatment, deep cleaning of the historic interior, and collection movements.ldquoOn these public tours you will be able to see the work progress in the House, meet our staff and volunteers, and learn about collections care and integrated pest management.Public tours will run this Wednesday and also on February ,  and  and March  and .

Many already know that Dunfermline has good story to tell when it comes to history. Our job has been to collect the best stories so that itrsquos easier for local residents to tell their friends, family and visitors.ldquoAs well as attracting more visitors and generating income for the local economy we hope that it builds local pride in the exceptional history of this town.Dunfermline was the birthplace of philanthropist and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who went on to establish public libraries in towns across the country. Much further back it was the burial site for Scotlandrsquos monarchs, while its more modern cultural heritage spans folk musician Barbara Dickson, The Skids and Stuart Adamsonrsquos Big Country.According to consultant David Hicks, who carried out the history audit, Dunfermline has a clutch of hidden treasures that have fallen off the typical tourist and localsrsquo radar.They include a Neolithic standing stone which is almost hidden by homes in the townrsquos s Pitcorthie housing estate.The .m sandstone block ndash listed as a national monument ndash was surrounded by granite setts in the s and seen as a compromise to the site. Another is St Margaretrsquos Cave, a deep gorge which was the scene for the Scottish queenrsquos private devotions and which at one point was under threat of being lost to a car park development.ldquoIn the s the local council decided it would be the perfect place to build a car park but locals made an enormous fuss, says Hicks. ldquoA compromise was made so the council still got the car park but built a tunnel to allow access to the caves.ldquoSt Margaretrsquos Stone, which is said to have been where the queen rested after coming across the ferry from Edinburgh, now marks the entrance to a business park.The audit has been split into six themes to create a guide which is being distributed around the town in the hope that it will help locals and hotel, shop and restaurant staff share Dunfermlinersquos heritage with visitors, while a new website is being developed to tell the townrsquos story.Plans include a series of cultural activities including a heritage festival.Mr Williams added: ldquoFor tourists and visitors, therersquos no more powerful recommendation than word of mouth by locals.ldquoAs well as attracting more visitors and generating income for the local economy we hope that it builds local pride in the exceptional history of this town."},{"url":null,"title":"javid-rules-out-dday-election","story":"Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, was responding to reports that Tory HQ had put the party on a war footing for a summer election.Suggestions were made over the weekend that Conservative strategists had block-booked printing plants and tripled the partyrsquos digital advertising revenue under cover of the spring local elections with a view to Theresa May going to the country on June  ndash the th anniversary of the D-Day landings during the Second World War.A poll by Opinium also put the Conservatives seven points ahead of Labour on  per cent.

council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste

Kintore which have attracted a host of objections.Langstane Housing Association has tabled plans for four property blocks featuring  one-bed flats and six two-bed flats on vacant waste ground on Forest Road.But  objections have been raised on the grounds of insufficient parking and road safety, increased traffic and congestion on Forest Road and the scale of the development and the adverse impact on the amenity.In a report to Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee which meets on Tuesday, director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer says that “on balance” while the development may have an amenity impact on the neighbouring properties, it will fall within acceptable standards.He says: “The proposal for  affordable flats would make a positive contribution to affordable housing provision in Kintore.“It is accepted that any development on this site will alter the outlook from neighbouring dwellings, however, the use of the site for a flatted development is considered compatible with the infill nature of the site and settlement location.”Councillors will be told that the pre-application consultations and discussions during the determination of the application to reduce the potential impact on the neighbouring properties has resulted in the final layout and design.But in its objection, Kintore Community Council slams the proposal, particularly in terms of inadequate parking spaces.Chair Fiona Cooper states: “The proposed parking for the development of  spaces for  residents is insufficient and would result in overspill parking on the oppositie side of the road which would obviously have a major affect on existing residents.”In terms of the scale of the development, the community council recommends a maximum of two-storeys, with Mrs Cooper adding: “The proposed development by reason of size is out of character and would have an unacceptably adverse impact on the amenities of the properties immediately opposite the site and the surrounding area by reason of overlooking and having a visually overbearing impact.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system. It is both an honour and a privilege to get to know the site.”Full details and further pictures in The Orcadian this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level.

It is hope the project – which will be launched to coincide with the th anniversary of Bennett’s death – will inspire a new generation of composers to emerge and create “extraordinary symphonic pieces with a Scottish voice that is not patronising or backward”.Two gala concerts are being planned at the Royal Concert Hall and Barrowland Ballroom at next year’s Celtic Connections under the backing secured from the government’s Festivals Expo Fund.Donald Shaw, creative producer of Celtic Connections, said: “Martyn Bennett was very much the catalyst for the whole Grit Orchestra project happening.

This project is a declaration of intent to grasp the thistle and give a sense of confidence to orchestral works from Scottish composers. It’s about freedom, exploration and intent. The Grit Orchestra is a fantastic vehicle to achieve that.”Composer and violinist Greg Lawson, who has masterminded the previous Grit Orchestra performances, said he envisaged it becoming a “self-composing beast” which would also tour regularly around the world.

Palladian mansion is to be turned ice-cold – literally – in an effort to rid it of an insect plague threatening to destroy its historic collections.Newhailes House, in Musselburgh, East Lothian, has employed a team of “moth- busters” to tackle the problem creatures which are slowly eating away at the property’s textiles.The National Trust for Scotlandhas installed two ft-long industrial freezers, each the size of a shipping crate, inside the th-century country house to eradicate the insects as part of its largest ever pest management programme.Carpets, clothing, curtains and items of furniture will be wrapped in acid-free tissue paper before being cooled to-C to destroy moth eggs and larvae.Pest controllers will then use specialist back-mounted vacuum cleaners to clear up any debris left behind by the treatment in the hope it will preserve the historic materials.Newhailes House was once home to the influential Dalrymple family, who gave the house its library, rococo interiors and collections of paintings, ceramics and furniture.Built in  by pioneering architect James Smith, the house was vacated in  after passing through six generations of the Dalrymple family.It was bought by the NTS in  and is used for weddings, corporate events and guided tours.Staff at the property noticed a sharp rise in the webbing clothes moth or common clothes moth in  and have been managing the problem with localised treatment and targeted deep cleaning.However, moth numbers and damage have continued and the NTS is implementing the freeze programme to protect the collection.A team of volunteers has been recruited to work with the trust’s collection and conservation staff to undertake the low temperature treatment, deep cleaning of the historic interior and collection movements.Mel Houston, national preventive conservator at the NTS, said: “This is the biggest project that the National Trust for Scotland has ever undertaken to tackle a pest problem like this and protect the important collections here at Newhailes. “In the last year moth numbers at Newhailes have exploded and we’ve seen a fourfold increase in how many we’re finding.“We’re lucky to have been able to catch the problem at just the right time, when we’re able to do something to \u2028control the moths before \u2028really serious damage is \u2028done.”The charity has used freezers to destroy moths at other properties but on a small scale using chest-sized freezers. Ms Houston added: “The deep freeze and deep clean gives us the confidence that we’re killing off as many moths as we can. “We’ll never get rid of them completely but we’ll be able to get down to the level where they can be controlled.”Over the course of the project, the trust will run \u2028tours so that members of the public can learn about the damage that the insects have caused and see the moth management programme in action.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866393.1549038268!/image/image.jpg","title":"devolution cannot stand in the way of human rights christine jardine","story":"The UK Supreme Court and the United Nations have both warned that domestic abuse laws in Northern Ireland are undermining women#s human rights, but the UK Government is refusing to act even though the Stormont government is not currently sitting, writes Christine Jardine.Abuse comes dressed up in a iety of disguises.In some forms, it can appear warm and loving, even perhaps vulnerable, to the casual observer. But all are nasty, evil and damaging to those on the receiving end.At its worst, abuse can undermine the human rights of the people – usually, but not exclusively, women – who are subjected to it.One of the worst forms of domestic violence is sexual.Here in the UK we tend to think that we are alert to the dangers.As a society we believe that we abhor, and fight at every opportunity, to expose and excise abuse, of every iation.But just recently we were given a stark rebuke. Two in fact.Both the UK Supreme Court and the United Nations warned that the current domestic abuse laws in Northern Ireland are undermining the human rights of its women. That women in this part of our country do not have the benefit of the same rights and protection of the law as the rest of us.If that was not bad enough,any of us, or our daughters, should move to that other part of the UK we would lose the rights we were born with. You maybe wonder how, or even doubt, this is possible. But it is.The UK Supreme Court concluded that Northern Ireland’s abortion law is incompatible with human rights.: Nicola Sturgeon urged to back efforts to legalise abortion in Northern IrelandThe United Nations stated that the UK is violating the rights of women in Northern Ireland by restricting their access to abortion.To be clear, this is not an argument about the rights and wrongs of abortion, but of human rights. It is about whether people in every part of the UK enjoy the same basic rights.Before Parliament at the moment is an opportunity to address that inequality. But so far it remains untaken.And more often than not the excuse given is one that I find particularly hard to swallow: devolution.In each of the debates that I have been part of on this issue, the fact of the legislative existence of Stormont has been used as an excuse.The argument regularly made – and one I would normally agree with – is that devolved areas should not be interfered with.In this case, however, I am often left incredulous by those who say that while they recognise the situation is unacceptable and the law is in need of reform we shouldn’t interfere, even though Northern Ireland does not, at the moment have a working devolved legislature.That offends my sense of justice.When they have been asked, the majority of people in Northern Ireland have agreed that Westminster should step in.: Jacob Rees-Mogg: Easing NI abortion law would ‘damage the Union’Surely the people of Northern Ireland have a right to expect the same human rights as their fellow citizens in every other part of the UK I would expect no less for any of us in Scotland, although I am sure that we would never need that redress and certainly in this area the law in Scotland is already enacted.To be clear this is not, for me, simply about this Domestic Abuse Bill.Yes, Northern Ireland has the most restrictive abortion law in Europe with a near blanket ban, even for cases where there is a medical reason. And that is certainly central to the argument.This week Belfast high Court began hearing the case of a woman, Sarah Ewart, who was denied an abortion even though she was told her unborn baby had a fatal condition. She was forced to borrow money to make the journey to the UK for an abortion.Since , more than , women and girls have travelled to another country for an abortion. In , , made that traumatic journey.Sarah Ewart has the support of Northern Ireland’s human rights commission and of MPs like myself who last year voted to force Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to explain how officials can continue to enforce the ban.However, in Parliament, this has become about which should be more important: a constitutional argument or the human rights of the population.For me the people, not the constitution or national identity, should come first.Devolution, as I argued in the Commons, means that areas of legislation are delegated, or transferred to another authority.It should not mean that the UK Government abrogates all responsibility for the welfare of UK citizens or that it should not step up to resolve an injustice that is being done to some or any of our people, when there is no other body to fight their corner.And neither should those of us in areas with devolved authorities use it as a defence against helping others. Indeed, not only has the UN argued that is the case, two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland have agreed that, without their own devolved government, Westminster should act to change the law.In parliament this week I felt for Conservative minister Victoria Atkins MP, a barrister in her former career, who had to make the Government’s argument that women in Northern Ireland could not have the protection of the Domestic Abuse Bill currently going through parliament because it is a devolved area.Ms Atkins obviously feels as passionately as any of us that domestic abuse must be tackled but could not accept the case that it should be extended to Northern Ireland in the absence of a working executive there. There is currently a private members’ bill going through parliament, which I have backed, aimed at tackling the same issue.And there have been several recent attempts to change the law over what should and, in a better world, would be the private healthcare concern of the inidual women concerned.For the moment at least, it seems that those who fail to overcome the roadblocks to re-establishing devolution in Northern Ireland also fail to protect the rights of its women.Surely it’s time the rest of us took responsibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865210.1548919873!/image/image.jpg","title":"key snp figures told by nicola sturgeon to prepare for possible election","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP parliamentarians have been told by Nicola Sturgeon to prepare for a possible Scottish electionthe government at Holyrood fails to pass its budget today.The Scottish Government heads into today’s vote without a deal to secure a majority, risking defeat on its spending plans for the coming year.During a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by the First Minister on Monday, Ms Sturgeon warned her MPs that they should prepare for a possible Scottish election campaignthe government fails to get its budget through, The Scotsman understands.However the move comes amid speculation that Ms Sturgeon may need a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans on the issue. Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866933.1549226440!/image/image.jpg","title":"treatment of scots mps affirms abstentionism","story":"The leader of Sinn Fein says that looking at how Scotland#s Nationalist MPs are treated in Westminster affirms her belief in abstentionism.Sinn Fein’s seven elected MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons, despite repeated calls to do so during key Brexit votes.On whether her party would ever take their seats, Mary Lou McDonald claimed yesterday that the seven votes would be ineffectual and her party is resolute in its stance.“I have no business in Westminster, we have no business in your parliament,” she said.“Westminster, correctly, advances and protects what it regards to be British interests. We have no business interfering in that. I am Irish, we have two parliaments and we advance Irish interests. “I look at the experience of our Scottish colleagues and I see them at Westminster, I think there’s -odd, and I think they would readily attest that Westminster has no interest in Scotland either, Westminster has never served Irish interests, it’s not constituted to do that. Irish interests are defended in Dublin and Belfast.”McDonald told Andrew Marr that the Good Friday Agreement would have to be revisited in the event of a hard Brexit on  March, and an Irish unity referendum should be held.“Put simply,the border in Ireland cannot be mitigated, cannot be managed in the short term, then you put the question democratically in the hands of the people and allow them to remove the border,” she said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866947.1549228396!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk not remotely prepared for brexit insists nicola sturgeon","story":"The UK is #not remotely prepared# for Brexit and the process must be delayed, Nicola Sturgeon will warn in a keynote speech in the US today.The First Minister will step up calls for a second referendum with just  days left until the UK is due to formally leave the European Union.Prime Minister Theresa May insisted yesterday that Brexit will happen “on time” as she prepared toto Brussels seeking changes to the Irish backstop, a sticking point of her EU Withdrawal Deal which has been rejected by the Commons.But she faced a warning from the Irish deputy prime minister that “there are no credible alternative arrangements” to the proposal.She was also stung by the announcement that Japanese car giant Nissan has axed plans to make its X-Trail x vehicle in Sunderland, citing several reasons including Brexit uncertainty.Ms Sturgeon will launch a broadside at the turmoil engulfing Westminster over Brexit and insist that Scotland’s interests have been treated as an “afterthought” in a speech in Washington, DC today.“The UK is not remotely prepared to leave the EU in  days’ time,” Ms Sturgeon will say. “The UK government should finally recognise that, and it should ask the EU to agree to put back the planned date for Brexit.”Such a request would have to be backed up by an “achievable plan”, with Ms Sturgeon suggesting the UK government could reconsider plans to leave the single market and customs union. She will tell her audience at Georgetown University that a “better option is to hold a further referendum on EU membership”. “The Scottish Government’s view is that this issue should be put back to the people,” the First Minister will say on the first day of a trade mission to the US and Canada.“That no Scottish Parliament, of any political composition, would approach Brexit in the way that the UK government has helps to explain why Brexit is also relevant to the debate on Scottish independence.“In the independence referendum in , voters in Scotland were repeatedly told thatwe became independent, we would have to leave the European Union. Voting to stay in the UK was portrayed as the way to protect our EU membership. That in itself raises the question of whether decisions about Scotland should continue to be taken at Westminster or whether it would be betterthey were taken in Scotland. And now the ongoing chaos at Westminster and the way Scotland’s interests have been consistently ignored makes that question even more relevant. “So I have said I will outline my thoughts on the timing of a possible independence referendum in the next few weeks, once the terms of Brexit are clearer. But, amid the chaos, confusion and uncertainty of Brexit, one thing is clearer than ever. Namely, that Scotland’s vital national interests are not properly served by relying on the Westminster system which treats Scotland as an afterthought, and that those interests can only properly be served by being an independent country.”But writing in a weekend newspaper article, Mrs May insisted the departure date will not change and that she would “deliver Brexit on time”.The EU Withdrawal Agreement she struck with Brussels was rejected by the Commons over the Irish backstop provision which is aimed at keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open after Brexit.She said: “When Ito Brussels … I will be armed with a fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination to agree a pragmatic solution that delivers the Brexit the British people voted for, while ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.”Last week Mrs May secured Parliament’s backing to go back to Brussels in the hope of hammering out a fresh agreement that does not include the backstop – which is unacceptable to the DUP and Brexiteer Tories – and which will command a Commons majority.The Prime Minister is due to report back to Parliament on  February, with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day.However, there was a was warning for Mrs May that she may be opposed by her own Eurosceptic backbenchersthe deal she gets falls short of their expectations.European Research Group deputy chairman Steve Baker tweeted that there could be “trouble ahead” and suggested changes to the backstop may not satisfy them. “Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI [Northern Ireland] but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement,” he wrote.It came as a senior Nissan boss blasted Brexit “uncertainty” as he confirmed the company had scrapped plans to build the X-Trail x at its Sunderland plant.Gianluca de Ficchy, the Japanese firm’s Europe chairman, said the decision had been taken for “business reasons” affected by rules on diesel engines and reduced sales.The announcement that the X-Trail would be built in Japan was made in a letter to staff that followed a day of political rows between Brexit supporters and opponents over the reason for one of Wearside’s largest employers going against a  decision to build the car there.In the letter, Mr de Ficchy also said: “Clearly the uncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mates pull pensioner from blaze","story":"A RIVERDALE man has recounted the dramatic moments when he and a friend saved two of his neighbours from a blaze that gutted their home.Antoin Carlisle and Terence Young saved an elderly woman in her s and a man in his s from the house fire in Riverdale Park South around .am on Saturday morning. After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours. I knew there were old people in those houses so I had to do something. When it’s your own street you can’t just walk past it. I have to thank my friend Terence too becausehe wasn’t here then God knows what would have happened.”A spokesperson for the Fire Servicesaid: “Firefighters were called to a house fire on the ground floor of a two storey, mid-terraced property. A man in his s and a woman in her s were out of the property before the arrival of fire crews. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire.“Both casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock and taken to hospital. An elderly neighbour was also treated at the scene and taken to hospital. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental.”"},{"url":null,"title":"border communities braced for reemergence of unapproved roads for school run","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_fee-dd-ae-ef-dff_EmailParents have warned that thousands of pupils in Irish border communities could face disrupted journeys to schoola hard border is implemented post-Brexit..pushWhile many students attend schools on the opposite side of the border through schemes approved by authorities, countless others are believed to use a practice commonly referred to as “grannying”, to attend school in Northern Ireland.Parents living close to the border are braced for the re-emergence of “unapproved roads” like those used during the Troubles, to take their children to school.While the UK and Irish governments have maintained that the free movement of people between the two jurisdictions will not be affected, queues of traffic affecting thousands of people are anticipatedcustoms checks are reintroduced on the border after March .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A reciprocal agreement exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland whereby children living on one side of the border are able to access an education on the other side of the border.The caveat is that schools in Northern Ireland may only consider a child who is resident in the Republic of Ireland for admission after all resident children who have applied to the school have been considered.A practice known as “grannying” involves residents who move to the Republic presenting schools in Northern Ireland with proof of address at a grandmother or relative’s house to avoid being left out.One Londonderry mother, who admits to using the unauthorised practice, has expressed concern.The woman, who has lived in Donegal for more than  years and has two children attending school in Northern Ireland, said the idea of sending her children to school in the Republic of Ireland never crossed her mind.“I’m from Derry originally, I work and pay tax in Derry, it made sense for the children to go to school there,” she said.“If there was an emergency, or they were sick and had to leave school immediately, it’s not practical for them to be in Donegal and I’m driving to work in the morning anyway so it makes sense with the school run.”The Troubles saw many smaller cross-border roads become unauthorised border crossings known officially as “unapproved roads”, which local people used to avoid customs officials and security services.“In my village alone, a tiny village, there’s four back roads into Derry city,” the mother of two added.“I could confidently say % of my neighbours in this housing estate are from Derry city originally and still working there, or have children attend school there.“There’s no way they would have the manpower to guard the border and stop every car, and there’s no way people will wait in queues of traffic in the morning, they’ll find another way to get there, they’ll take back roads or roads that can’t be manned.”Marguerite Hamilton, a former principal of Thornhill College, a girls’ grammar school in the Culmore area of Derry, one mile from the Derry Donegal border, said it is “inconceivable” that children could be prevented or delayed from going to schoolcustoms posts were installed.Ms Hamilton said schools across Northern Ireland are aware of “grannying” students living over the border.“When a child applies for school, we ask for a veriable proof of address, a bank statement or letter from a doctor for example,they can supply the proof, it is not the school’s place to go around investigatingthe child actually resides there or not,” she said.“Also,circumstances change for instance,they start school living in Derry, and move even just one mile away to the south, should they be forced to leave the school and educational system they know “What’s clear is that those arguing about the border in London will not have their lives affected by the consequences.”Statistics on how often the practice is used are unveriable, but Ms Hamilton estimates that there are hundreds of children attending school in Northern Ireland who reside in the Republic.The Department of Education and Skills in the Republic of Ireland said it is confident the Common Travel Area will facilitate existing arrangements for cross-border pupils.Minister for education Joe McHugh said: “The school communities along the border, both in the north and in the south, have done tremendous work over the last  years in cementing the peace process and they deserve enormous credit for that.“I’ve talked about this issue in recent days with the heads of the department and the need to better understand the important role that these schools, their staff, pupils and parents have played in that and will continue to play.”Likewise, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said it is aware of the issue, but has faith that the Common Travel Area between the two jurisdictions will safeguard access to education.“The issue of the provision of  information on an application is not limited to the home address of a pupil and the department has provided guidance to schools on their duty to very application information,” a spokeswoman said.“A parent providing information that is found to be  may have the offer of a place for their child withdrawn.“In relation to the impact of Brexit, the British and Irish governments have agreed that the rights flowing from the Common Travel Area should be maintained.  “The Common Travel Area provides citizens of the UK and Republic of Ireland with the right to access services, including education, in the other jurisdiction.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britain set for more traditional winter after big

Mrs Foster conceded that the EU are \"tough negotiators\". \"I dont expect them to roll over within hours,\" she said.\"But they must face up to reality. \"The blockage to getting a deal is the backstop, therefore there must be sensible engagement and a pragmatic approach.\"Here in Kesh we are within walking distance of the border. \"Local people travel to and fro across the border multiple times every day. \"It is quite disgraceful for some in Brussels to exploit genuine fears by spinning tales of border posts, troops and queues.\"No one is building border checkpoints. No one is sending troops to the border either.\"Such talk is foolish and careless. \"Lets focus on getting a sensible deal which works for Brussels, Dublin and London.\"Speaking from Brussels yesterday, Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson also called for a dferent approach from the EU in order to reach a workable deal.The MEP, who was first elected to the European Parliament in , said: \"There are real dangers of a no-deal situation, so with less than  days before the UKs departure from the EU I would urge a more constructive and positive approach from the EU leaders in the coming days and weeks.\"I have been clear, there is a problem with the backstop, not least that it is in direct contradiction to the principle of consent as enshrined within the Belfast Agreement. That needs to be fixed.\"But I am firmly of the view that no problem is insurmountable, and I believe that the EU wants to agree a workable deal.\"Mr Nicholson said he had detected a change in tone from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.\"Although time is running out, nothing is insurmountable and common sense must prevail,\" the veteran politician said.Meanwhile, a Cabinet minister warned MPs that they may not be re-elected to Parliamentthey block Theresa Mays Brexit agreement and force the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal. Liam Fox said politicians would have \"little cover when they next face the voters\"their actions led to a no-deal exit.Mr Fox became the latest frontbencher to suggest Britains withdrawal may have to be delayed. The International Trade Secretary said Downing Streets insistence that the UK will leave the EU on March , and suggestions by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom that the exit date could be pushed back, were not \"incompatible\" stances. \"There would be a huge dference between an extension to Article  because we hadnt reached an agreement, or a short delay because we had reached an agreement and needed the legislation to implement it,\" he said after a speech in London.

year in protest at the Chequers agreement, and Ms Morgan were involved talks last week between MPs from the Remain and Brexiteer wings of the Conservative Party over the so-called Malthouse compromise, developed by Housing Minister Kit Malthouse.A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Home Secretary set out on Marr, the Attorney Generalis looking at the legal changes we are aiming to secure to the backstop.“As the PM has previously said, there are a number of ideas on this, including a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit and the AG is considering their wording and legal effect.“He will be closely engaged throughout the process.”The group is due to meet at the Cabinet Office in Whitehall, with meetings also scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday this week.I hope our meetings with Government are as constructive as they should be because Malthouse is the only game in townwe are to achieve a dealSteve BakerFacebookTwitterThe Malthouse compromise is seen as one of the main reasons the ERG changed its mind and backed an amendment last Tuesday tabled by Sir Graham Brady, which urged the Government to look at backstop alternatives.Ms Morgan said last week that under the terms of the Malthouse compromise the Northern Ireland backstop would be “recast” as “free trade agreement-lite” with a commitment there would be no hard border with Ireland.At the same time, the -month transition period would be extended by another year to December , during which EU citizens’ rights would continue and the UK would pay into the EU budget.Mr Baker said last week that the plan would replace the backstop – which is supposed to be temporary – with a permanent arrangement, while allowing more time to secure a free trade agreement with the EU.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The compromise was developed by Housing Minister Kit Malthouse He told the Press Association on Sunday: “After a positive conference call today running through the Government’s questions, I’m more confident than ever we can land the Malthouse compromise, including the indefinite Better Deal backstop protocol.“I hope our meetings with Government are as constructive as they should be because Malthouse is the only game in townwe are to achieve a deal.“I just hope engagement is as sincere as the PM’s words at the despatch box led us to expect.”Mrs May told the Commons the group had put forward “a serious proposal that we are engaging with sincerely and positively”.She added: “We will sit down and work through the proposal that has come forward.”The Downing Street spokeswoman said that as well as meetings with Mr Barclay the group would also meet with civil servants from HM Revenue and Customs, the Cabinet Office’s Europe Unit, Number  and “other relevant departments”.Earlier on Sunday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid suggested that Border Force figures believe there are viable alternative arrangements to the Irish border backstop that would avoid the need for a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.It came as he revealed the Brexit Secretary was looking at such arrangements – raised in the Brady amendment passed by MPs on Tuesday – while Attorney General Geoffrey Cox looks into whether a time limit or “exit mechanism” can be added to the backstop to make it more palatable to Parliament.Mr Javid told Marr: “In terms of an alternative arrangement it can be done.“In my own department I have got Border Force and I asked Border Force months ago to advise me to look at what alternative arrangements were possible.“They have shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology. It is perfectly possible, the only thing missing is a bit of goodwill on the EU side.”👇That would not be « goodwill » but a dereliction of duty by public authorities in the EU that have a duty to ensure public health and safety of consumers, protect against unfair competition and enforce public policies and international agreements. https:t.co fpXibGzAP— Sabine WeyandFebruary , However this was publicly questioned by Sabine Weyand, deputy to European Commission chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.She tweeted: “That would not be ‘goodwill’ but a dereliction of duty by public authorities in the EU that have a duty to ensure public health and safety of consumers, protect against unfair competition and enforce public policies and international agreements.”"},{"url":null,"title":"highflying ni teacher valerie travels world to tutor kids of superrich for 2000","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has taught on yachts, mid-air, chauffeur-driven cars and by luxury pools.Earning between £,-£, a year with her tutoring gig, Valerie knows the pressure is on to prove herself and get results on each assignment.\"If you cant deliver then they will find someone ,\" the Lisburn woman told the Daily Mail.\"I have years of experience, I can guarantee to get them up to the level needed, and I know I can do it.\"Its an interesting lestyle to step in and out of. \"It can be very glamorous, people are paying you big money and you have to live up to what you say you can do.\"Valerie, who gained many years experience as a teacher in north Wales before ing to her native Northern Ireland to help care for her father, switched to tutoring the super rich in .She signed up to two agencies in London - the Duke and Duchess International and The London Governess Agency - who both cater specically to royals, millionaires and billionaires.She explained that they negotiate the teaching packages with the families before the tutors are informed, so the prices y from client to client depending on the intensity of the studies. And Valerie said she has become accustomed to travelling at short notice, depending on where her skills are needed, preferring the flexibility of short-term stints with families over long-term placements.\"I was contacted on a Wednesday for a seven-day contract in Switzerland starting on the Friday,\" she said. \"So I flew to Zurich the next day to spend seven days teaching and preparing a Swiss boy for the + common entrance exams for a top Scottish boarding school.\"That assignment was a success after six-hour days of Valeries intense tutoring, but sometimes her education missions can be more challenging.\"Most of the time its okay and I kind of have a schedule of what Im doing, but sometimes on a whim [the family] will just decide theyre leaving,\" she said.\"They will say were leaving tomorrow. I was in Dubai twice in one week, you have to pack up and go too, otherwise they can just cut your time short.\"Families are prepared to pay high prices for Valeries services because she has \"a solid record of getting pupils through their GCSE level and entrance exams for example at Eton, Harrow, and Merchiston Castle\".And she knows shes unlikely to ever struggle for work in a world where parents will do anything to help their child succeed.\"Sometimes its assumed that parents who pay a lot of money for tutoring are also disconnected from their children, and want to pass the burden to the tutor,\" she said.\"I have come across that. I have had one pupil who said to me Mummy orders tutors all the time, like ordering a takeaway,\" she said.Theres a lot of hard work involved, but for Valerie, its certainly rewarding. \"Teaching is the best job in the world as far as I am concerned,\" she said. \"Andyou do what you love you will never work a day in your le.\""},{"url":null,"title":"long queues as northern ireland petrol station slashes prices to 99p","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths.

The backstop is the bottom line.“On the issue of the border poll, there’s no point us burying our heads in the sand and wish away a hard Brexit.“We prepare for the worst scenario and protect our national interest.”Ms McDonald told Marr that anyone gambling with peace on the island of Ireland is acting recklessly.“One of the biggest symbols of success of the peace process is that people can travel unimpeded over the border.”VIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, Aldergrove Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Saturday, Ms McDonald said that the unionist community needs to be a part of planning for a united Ireland.At an event in Dublin to discuss the campaign for Irish unity she said: “Obviously, our unionist brothers and sisters need to be part of planning a new Ireland, their first option, of course, is to maintain the Union with Britain and we respect that, but as one ex-leader of the DUP put it, they need to start now planning for all eventualities and unionism needs a Plan B.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Snow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayIan Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School.

He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mixed gender teams make up the remaining %.It means businesswomen could be missing out on billions of pounds in funding, as companies with no women on their founding teams hoover up an estimated pound billion a year.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss described the figures as ldquoshocking, but said women need to be less ldquosqueamish about making money.The research, undertaken with Diversity VC and the British Venture Capital Association , will inform ongoing Government work to boost untapped potential of businesses which are facing barriers.Liz Truss The findings indicate that at current rates of change, it will take more than  years for all-female teams to receive p for every pound of UK venture capital investment.Speaking to the Daily , Ms Truss said the funding process had to be ldquomore open, more transparent and more meritocratic.ldquoIt is shocking that in  virtually % of all funding is going to all-male teams. Itrsquos not even going to mixed teams. For anyone looking in, it looks like men have a monopoly on getting that funding.However the minister said that women need to be ldquoless squeamish about making money.She told the paper: ldquoThe culture is it is a bit vulgar to talk about money or to say you want to make a profit, but actually itrsquos a huge benefit to society and a huge benefit to yourself.The research was originally commissioned by Philip Hammond during his  Budget. It identies specic barriers faced by female-led firms in accessing venture capital.Alice Hu Wagner, managing director of strategy and economics at the British Business Bank, said ldquoseemingly simple solutions had proven to be flawed because ldquomandating female decision-makers risks tokenism while earmarking women-only money does not address ldquounderlying closed networks and experience gaps.ldquoWe need new approaches to addressing these issues and this report is just a first step, she added.Ms Truss echoed the concern, telling the : ldquoNobody wants for their business to be funded because theyrsquore a woman.ldquoThey want to be judged on the basis of how good their ideas are, how hardworking they are, not the colour of their skin or their gender..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Female-founded new businesses get p for every  xA of venture capital investment article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There will be two weekend closures in the Lurgan area between February - and March - before a four week line closure between  July and  August.Bus substitutions will be in place. This is preparation work for the Lurgan Area Track Renewal Project. This is a substantial scheme to enhance and improve the railway line.Translink will implement a four-week closure this summer of the railway line at Lurgan to fully relay over .km of track, running from the William St level crossing to beyond Bell’s Row level crossing. This closure will be in place between Friday  July and Friday  August inclusive.Some preliminary drainage and level crossing work will be undertaken during engineering line closures on the weekends of - February and - March, with further preparatory work being carried out in the area, outside of normal working hours and overnight, between April and July. This will be a major project, increasing the railway operational line speed in the area and improving safety and efficiency for rail users. The project will also include relaying the three level crossings in the area and renewing the  metres of existing  structures at the station.John Glass, Translink’s Director of Infrastructure and Projects, said: ‘‘Numbers of passengers choosing the train have grown strongly in recent years.Lurgan is now a key station for commuters, with over . million passengers using the Portadown Line every year, and nearly  million passengers using the cross-border, Belfast – Dublin Enterprise service annually. “This work will see us remove current speed restrictions, providing more efficient journeys while maintaining overall performance and high safety standards.The investment also secures the long-term sustainability of this line and maintains vital cross-border connectivity on this important corridor, in line with our Enterprise Strategic Development Plan.Longer-term, the work will also reduce the level of maintenance on the line. “Representing a signicant capital investment, the works will also help contribute to the continued economic growth of the town and the surrounding area.The work represents the first phase of a number of planned strategic improvements within the area over the coming years, including signalling redesign works and an enhanced station, subject to appropriate funding and permissions.“As plans progress, we are prioritising engagement with local elected representatives and other stakeholders, including sports and community organisations, so that local people are made fully aware of the planned upgrade. This engagement will continue between now and the main upgrade works this summer. “We will be working closely with our contractors to complete the works as quickly as possible and keep disruption to a minimum.Calls for action on busy Lurgan road after three accidents in a week Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“Translink is committed to investing in our infrastructure and improving services, ensuring that we progress our journey to being ‘your first choice for travel in Northern Ireland.”try catch  TrendingPolice concerned for safety of missing N.I. manToy Reece Milner bought for his young son arrived this morning before his funeralArrest after attack on ambulance, PSNI and hospital staffHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol St Maryrsquos Hall to be demolished          ..

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
