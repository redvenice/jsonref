In that time, more than 20,000 people took part in the show seeking help to resolve relationship issues, or to address drug or alcohol related problems. \u0027The central purpose of the show was conflict resolution, and the show achieved many positive outcomes where people were able to resolve personal problems.\u0027The Jeremy Kyle Show had extensive and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors built up over 14 years. \u0027It had a dedicated guest welfare team of mental healthcare professionals with decades of experience in NHS mental healthcare, who were focused on the welfare of guests throughout the production process. \u0027Guests were supported by the programme and welfare teams prior to filming, throughout filming and after filming. \u0027Should they require ongoing help then appropriate solutions were found for them, which could include residential rehabilitation, counselling, anger management, family mediation, child access mediation or couples counselling.\u0027Due to the gravity of events in May 2019, namely the death of a guest a few days after taking part in the show, ITV decided to end production of the show. \u0027It would not be appropriate for ITV to comment further on that in advance of the inquest to be held later this month, other than to say that our sympathies are with Mr Dymond\u0027s family and friends.\u0027ITV does not accept the central allegation of this programme of a \u0027bad culture\u0027 within the production team. \u0027We note that the programme includes anonymous former production members claiming wrongdoing by themselves and others, without supporting evidence.

Photograph: Arthur EdwardsPoolAFP via GettyThe Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith was already filling up and the musicians were tuning up almost an hour before Prince Charles and his wife Camilla arrived. It was a patchwork of green dresses and ties, tweed coats and shamrock earrings, and a medley of Irish accents, some gently inflected by their years in England. “Singers: mezzanine. Knitters into room 2,” came the announcement over a loudspeaker.Cathy Richardson, originally from Waterford city but long settled in Fulham, was among the knitters and she was wearing a pink knitted scarf, hat and sweater. One of her friends had knitted the hat and scarf but the sweater was, she said, “Primark’s best”. I asked her if she was excited about meeting the royal couple. “I couldn’t care less,” she said. “I’ve seen Charlie before. What is there to be excited about.”The knitting group, which meets at the centre once a week, were sitting around an oval table with balls of wool and half-knitted garments in front of them. Mary Hamarogue from Ballinrobe, Co Mayo, said the knitting circle was a hotbed of gossip. “We come here every Tuesday afternoon and we gossip about everything. We’re at an age when we can say anything,” she said.Downstairs, Charles and Camilla were arriving and pressing the flesh before sitting among a group of musicians and receiving a lightning lesson in playing the bodhrán. The prince took to it quickly enough, leaning in as he picked up the pace and after a while his wife got the knack too, tapping her black suede boots as she hammered away at the goatskin.Charles and Camilla will be in Ireland next week for their sixth visit in less than a decade and they have already visited all but a handful of counties. But pulling a pint of Guinness remained a challenge as the prince struggled with how long to let it settle before topping it up and sipping it before it was ready and leaving part of it on the end of his nose. “An unsettling experience,” he pronounced.Then it was upstairs to meet the knitting group and as the prince admired their work, Cathy from Waterford city commanded his attention. “Charles, do you like mine?” she said. “Do you get better and better as you go on?” he said. “Ah listen, love, I’ve been knitting since I was four years of age,” she said. As the couple were whooshed out into the next room, Cathy was triumphant. “Jesus, I’m famous,” she said.The Irish Cultural Centre opened in Hammersmith in 1995 to promote Irish art and culture through community, education and cultural programmes. But, chairman Peter Power-Hynes said, many people in Ireland and elsewhere still confuse the centre with the London Irish Centre in Camden.“We’re purely cultural but what we say is that we do welfare through culture, whereas Camden tend to do the majority of their work through pure welfare, which is the reason they were created in the first place. We have a very modern building which is only seven years old and we’re actually hoping to expand into the adjoining building,” he said.When John Byrne showed the royal couple around the centre’s library, Charles pointed to Tim Pat Coogan’s biography of De Valera and asked if he had read it. Camilla spoke about her affection for Edna O’Brien’s novels.After a brief detour when they sang Percy French’s Mountains of Mourne along with the singing group, the royal couple went downstairs to watch a display of Irish dancing. The six dancers looked splendid in their sequinned costumes as they performed great feats of footwork and athleticism. Downstage left stood an easel bearing a plaque draped in a piece of silk fabric which the prince was due to unveil but as the dancing gained momentum, the easel started to tremble. With a great crash, it fell forward on to the stage, revealing the plaque and it had to be rushed into the wings before being put back together in time for Charles to unveil the plaque a second time.Within a couple of minutes, the royal couple were gone, departing in a blur of sirens and whistles. I asked Cathy if she had enjoyed meeting them. “Yeah, they were all right. They’re the same as us,” she said. “They are, aren’t they? The dead same. He’s a man, she’s a woman, that’s the way I look at it.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"poultry farm costs it s no longer about making money it s about surviving","story":"‘If it keeps going the way it is there might not be any organic eggs in the country in three or four months.’ File photograph: Joern PollexGetty ImagesPoultry farmers Mark and Grainne Duffy’s lives are consumed by numbers: the 9,000 hens they have on their Monaghan farm, the 50 per cent increase already in the feed bills they face, and the losses they are already suffering on every egg leaving their farm.The couple, who run the organic egg operation MGC Organic Farm in Ballybay, are facing a €125,000 increase in their usual feed bill to the end of April, while so far they have been unable to secure contracts from their feed supplier for after that date, such is the volatility of the market.“The business is no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” Duffy told the The . “Feed has gone from €510 a tonne to €713 a tonne and there’s talk of a further €60-a-tonne rise. Things are getting crazy.”LoansThe couple’s main issue is in sourcing organic certified grain. They have options to buy non-organic grain and switch to conventional barn eggs but even then, the rise in feed costs means they might not make enough to cover the loans they have taken out.“If it keeps going the way it is there might not be any organic eggs in the country in three or four months. We need an extra 5 cent per egg to keep us in business but the supermarkets aren’t covering the increases the farmer has to pay.“Consumers need to understand what’s happening to the primary producer – many of us our on our knees,” Duffy said. “I’ve had to let part-time staff go and get a job off-farm just to keep the loans covered.“The way things are going, my wife might have to get an off-farm job too to keep us going. It was always my dream to go full-time farming and things were going so well that I’d managed to do it, but I’ve had to go back working.”ShadowThe shadow cast by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is deepening by the day, he said, affecting not just himself and his wife, but also the pullet producer who breeds his young hens and the lorry drivers who deliver his grain.As an organic farmer, Duffy had been using herbal leys – a mixture of forage grasses, herbs and legumes – for his hens as forage material to supplement their feed intake, but restrictions imposed to counter avian bird flu earlier in the year have created a “the perfect storm” for the industry.“The big problem here is in securing meal. There were efforts to do it before but they never took off, and farmers would have difficulty securing the machinery that they need if they were to do it this year,” Duffy said.For now, the Monaghan couple are left with major questions over the next two months, and few readily-available answers. If feed costs continue to rise they will have to approach the bank and pray that they can “ride it out”, he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state making a mess of covid bonus scheme say unions","story":"The trade unions argue the scheme as envisaged now is a significant ergence from the one  announced barely two months ago.The State has been accused of “making a mess” out of the Covid bonus payment and rendering it “unacceptable and unworkable”, amid a deepening political row over the €1,000 idend to be paid to frontline healthcare workers.The group of unions representing healthcare workers hit out at both the Department of Health and the HSE on Tuesday, arguing the current plan for the bonus significantly differs from that laid out in January. “We have had eight wasted weeks since the Taoiseach and Minister for Health announced a €1,000 bonus for healthcare workers,” chair of the joint national council (NJC) of HSE staff unions, Tony Fitzpatrick said. Unions have kicked out against a proposal to pay the bonus on a pro-rata basis, meaning some eligible for it would only get as little as €200, depending on how long they worked in certain frontline positions. The trade unions argue this is a ergence from the scheme as billed, and will exclude or minimise payments to many who left their roles to work in the frontline temporarily, exposing themselves to risk in the first wave especially, when infection prevention protocols were not fully developed and little was known of the virus. “The NJC have told the HSE that the proposal in its present format is unacceptable and unworkable. The approach taken by the HSE is attempting to introduce restrictions limiting the availability of the full €1,000”A draft plan circulated to unions this month would see those who worked less than 14 weeks given a payment of just €200.Trade union sources said the draft document states that those who worked equal or greater to 55 weeks in a Covid-19 exposed environment between March 1st 2020, and June 30th 2021, will receive €1,000.Those working between 41 and 55 weeks will get €800, and between 28 weeks and less than 41 weeks will get €600. People working less than 28 weeks but more than or equal to 14 weeks will get €400.Healthcare workers will have to have worked 60 per cent of full time hours in order to be eligible, with those working less than this figure receiving 60 per cent of the cash value of whatever band they fall into.Mr Fitzpatrick said the unions are “strongly of the view that the HSE are not being loyal to what was announced by Government. Our frontline workers stepped up to the mark during a national health crisis. The HSE and Department of Health seem intent on making a mess out of showing our healthcare workers gratitude.”The Department has also defined what will is meant by a Covid-19 exposed environment, with the document thought to describe that those covered should be frontline staff who were at increased risk in the course of duties in a clinical setting.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his

punishing one despot for starting a war in Europe requires cosying up to another in the Middle East.Mr Johnson says the barbaric actions of Vladimir Putin in invading Ukraine are “testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity” and Britain must respond by moving away from “dependence on Russian oil”.As Britain’s Russian energy boycott contributes to pushing oil prices to record highs at home, the Government says that “demand can be met by alternative suppliers”.So it is with cap in hand that Mr Johnson will fly to Riyadh, one of the few oil producers with the spare capacity to immediately ramp up production, to ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to pump more oil to ease prices.While Mr Johnson has condemned Mr Putin for launching an illegal invasion in which Ukrainian civilians have been indiscriminately targeted in their homes, hospitals and schools, he is far more circumspect about Saudi Arabia\u0027s 36-year-old de facto leader, with whom he reportedly corresponds via WhatsApp messenger. Mr Johnson views Riyadh as “a partner”, his spokesman said last week, which means the kingdom’s de facto leader is not subject to the same criticism as Putin.Thus it is not thought Mr Johnson will publicly speak out against the kingdom carrying out the largest mass executions in its history over the weekend. It also puts Mr Johnson at odds with Joe Biden, the US president, who was elected promising to challenge Saudi human rights abuses and hold Prince Mohammed to account for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.British arms sales to Saudi ArabiaLikewise, Saudi Arabia’s disastrous air war in Yemen is not likely to be subject to the same criticism as Putin’s Ukraine invasion.A war more distant and entrenched than Ukraine, Yemen’s seven-year-old conflict is nonetheless described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is also fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.British-made bombs and planes have been implicated in scores of Saudi strikes that have killed civilians. Over half of the Saudi air force aircraft flying sorties over the country are UK-supplied, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, with some even dropping UK-made cluster munitions on the impoverished country.Saudi Arabia says it is defending itself against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which have attacked the kingdom with drones and missile strikes. But its air campaign has faced accusations of indiscriminately targeting civilians, while a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas has contributed to pushing the country to the brink of famine.Rather than pressuring Saudi Arabia to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, Mr Johnson may be asked to pledge further weapons sales or British support for Riyadh’s security policy towards Yemen and arch-rival Iran, according to Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East programme.“If there is an agreement over Saudi supply I think the UK could commit to supporting the Saudi position on security issues in the region,” said Ms Vakil. Facing a cost of living crisis at home and a war in Europe that threatens to escalate, Mr Johnson may have to calculate whether that is a price worth paying for Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient tombs found notre dame remarkable discovery builders","story":"Archaeologists working at Paris’ Notre-Dame Cathedral have made two “exceptional” discoveries, including a lead sarcophagus believed to be from the 1300s containing a “well preserved” body.The objects, described by the French culture ministry as being “of remarkable scientific quality”, were unearthed during preparatory work for rebuilding the church’s famous lead spire, which was destroyed in a massive fire in April 2019.Reconstruction workers were preparing to install scaffolding in the ground to rebuild the 300ft tall spire when they stumbled across the items underneath the rubble.During a visit to the cathedral on Tuesday, a team of archaeologists showed Roselyne Bachelot, France’s culture minister, around the excavation site, explaining how they used a mini endoscopic camera to examine the body located inside the lead sarcophagus, which was partially punctured.“We saw a very well preserved body,” Christophe Besnier, the lead archaeologist said. “You can glimpse pieces of fabric, hair and above all a pillow of leaves on top of the head, a well-known phenomenon when religious leaders were buried.”Mr Besnier added: “The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation.”While the identity of the body is unknown, preliminary findings suggest the coffin was made for a senior dignitary sometime in the 1300s. Some 400 bodies have been buried at Notre-Dame since the 13th-century, including bishops, archbishops and canons.Archaeologists working at the site said the discoveries would help improve their understanding of funeral practices during the Middle Ages.Also unearthed was a piece of a rood screen - an ornate partition that was a typical feature of Medieval churches.The excavation, which began on February 2, is being carried out by the Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research. The culture ministry has now agreed to extend the institute’s work until March 25, when renovations on the 850-year-old church are scheduled to continue.Cathedral hoped to reopen by 2024Pressure is growing for the church to be reopened. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has set a strict deadline for 2024, when Paris will host the summer Olympic Games.The 2019 fire, which was likely started by an electrical fault, wiped out the spire and better part of the cathedral’s roof within about an hour. Remarkably, firemen were able to save the stone structure.More than 340,000 donations - totaling nearly €850 million - have been made since then to help with the restoration. Among them, include a combined €300 million donation from French billionaires Francois-Henri Pinault and Bernard Arnault.But reconstruction efforts have been littered with controversy.In July 2020, Mr Macron was forced to drop his suggestion to replace the 19th-century spire, designed by the French architect Viollet-le-Duc, with a “contemporary architectural gesture” following an outcry from purists who argued the cathedral should keep its traditional structure.Then in December 2021, a commission of heritage experts approved a controversial plan to partially modernise the cathedral’s interior as part of the reconstruction, adding contemporary artworks and new lighting effects - much to the chagrin of critics who say the changes will disrupt the traditional design.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fourth round covid vaccinations could start next week slow rollout","story":"The rollout of fourth Covid jabs could start as soon as next week following criticism that NHS planned timescales were too slow. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended extra boosters for those aged 75 and over around six months after their last vaccine. But the NHS in England has yet to embark on the fourth rollout, despite the fact it is now six months since the last rollout began. In guidance published last month, NHS England told vaccination services that the rollout was “expected to begin from early April”.Last week The  highlighted concerns that the programme was moving too slowly in England, with Jeremy Hunt, the former Health Secretary, calling for “more oomph on fourth jabs”.The JCVI was also understood to be keen to see England start as soon as is operationally possible.Increased casesOn Tuesday night a health source said: “We expect the rollout of the next set of boosters for the over-75s and those in elderly care homes to start as soon as next week. We are seeing cases increasing amongst the elderly and it’s right that we crack on with it.”They said the timing was not related to recent rises in cases but to ensure the recommendations of the JCVI, which suggest a six-month interval, were followed in England.  Scotland began its rollout more than a week ago, with all over-75s being offered jabs 24 weeks after their last booster.It comes amid rising Covid cases across the UK, with concern that the patterns could reflect waning immunity among those who were the first to receive third doses. Latest figures in England show just 55.5 per cent of over-75s had a booster within the last five months, compared with 68.7 per cent the week before.Those in this age group are expected to start getting texts and letters inviting them for a fourth jab as soon as next week, with booking systems set to open as soon as Monday. NHS officials have always insisted that those eligible for a fourth dose will receive an invitation six months after their last jab, but said most of those in this group would not reach this stage until April. In the last seven days, cases have risen by 52 per cent.‘No cause for concern’However, the Health Secretary has said such increases were to be expected.“We are now open as a country and there’s more social mixing, but there’s nothing in the data at this point in time that gives us any cause for concern,” Sajid Javid told Sky News on Monday. Meanwhile, Covid hospital admissions have risen by 25 per cent.More than half of hospital patients with Covid are “incidental” cases, which means they are more likely to reflect infection rates in the community rather than severe illness.  Scientists have indicated the rise in cases may also reflect the rise of the new BA.2 variant, with some suggestions that it could be more transmissible.Latest data shows vaccine efficacy after a Pfizer booster drops from around 90 per cent to 75 per cent at 10 to 14 weeks. The next set of data due later this week is expected to show how well this holds up at around five months. Last week, Prof Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, urged health chiefs to “get on with” the rollout of extra boosters.She said England should follow other countries such as Israel which  “swung into action” with its fourth vaccinations.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland keep face masks another two weeks due spike cases","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has scrapped plans to lift Scotland’s strict face mask rules next week in a move businesses said would throw the country’s economic recovery into “reverse gear”The First Minister on Tuesday claimed a surge in Covid-19 cases meant it was “prudent” to keep mandatory mask rules, which had been due to be lifted on Monday after 20 months, until April 4 at the earliest.She claimed the move would be popular with “many people” concerned at a rise in cases which she blamed on a new “sub-variant” of Covid-19 which she said was placing the health service under “severe pressure”.However, businesses reacted furiously to the delay, claiming it would dent consumer confidence, create confusion among the public and slow down economic growth.Meanwhile, opposition MSPs pointed to figures that showed that Scotland’s stricter mask rules had not prevented case numbers soaring well ahead of England’s, where masks have not been mandatory since January and all other Covid laws were scrapped last month.‘A bitter disappointment for economy’Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said that the decision to delay the lifting of all restrictions had come as a “bitter disappointment”.“Further delay will put Scotland’s recovery into reverse gear again, create confusion, dent business confidence, putting the buffers on economic growth,” she said.“The success of the vaccine rollout minimises the risk of serious illness and should enable Scotland’s businesses and iniduals to begin living and working with increasing normality alongside the virus.“Businesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop lever being pulled just weeks apart, with no clear confirmation as to what the triggers driving decision making are.”England and Northern Ireland have already ended all legal Covid-19 restrictions, while the Welsh Government plans to lift its coronavirus laws on March 28, although its mask rules are not as strict as Scotland’s.Ms Sturgeon said that all other legal restrictions, such as a requirement on hospitality venues to collect customers’ contact details and for businesses, places of worship and service providers to have “due regard” for her guidance, would end on Monday as planned.She told MSPs she hoped the mask rules would now end on April 4 but refused to rule out that she could yet announce a further delay. She claimed keeping masks “temporarily” would protect vulnerable people while chances of catching the virus are high.She told the Holyrood chamber that 38,770 new cases had been reported over the previous four days compared to 36,051 in the same period last week. Almost 2,000 people were in hospital with coronavirus, although a significant proportion of these are likely to be “incidental” admissions, meaning they are primarily there because of other health conditions.Despite Scotland having stricter rules, the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 18 people north of the border had coronavirus in its most recent survey. This compared with one in 25 in England.Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said Ms Sturgeon’s reversal over face masks showed that she did not trust the public.“It’s bad enough that the First Minister has gone back on her word to businesses and the public by extending the facemask requirement,” he said.“But, worse still, she could not even guarantee that this would only be for a further two weeks.“That’s more unacceptable uncertainty for businesses and the public who have already sacrificed so much over the last two years.”Places where face coverings will continue to have to be worn include shops, public transport, churches and when moving around pubs and restaurants.Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licenced Trade Association, said many Scots had become “jaded” by the mask rules and were now “simply not bothering”.“Our sector still has many ongoing issues to overcome and there is an onus on the Scottish Government to support our industry which is key to the economy and jobs,” he said. “We need them to promote confidence and positivity.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein cant hide sorry history putin apologism","story":"Last week, caught on the hop by the behaviour of Vladimir Putin, for whom it has a soft spot, Sinn Fein – historically the political wing of the IRA – deleted 20 years of potentially embarrassing material from its official website: 2,729 pages of statements by its party representatives were reduced to 373.So presumably out went the justification for Sinn Fein MEPs abstaining in 2015 on a European Parliament resolution condemning Russia’s “direct and indirect involvement in the armed conflict in Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea” any record of party leader Mary Lou McDonald attacking the then taoiseach Leo Varadkar for his “flagrant disregard for Irish neutrality” when the Irish government expelled a Russian diplomat after the Salisbury poisonings Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan in 2019 voting in the European Parliament against plans to block a Russian gas line and MEP Chris McManus being one of 69 politicians out of 548 to vote against the resolution in the European Parliament supporting Ukraine’s independence last December.Sinn Fein is a cult whose members obediently parrot whatever party line they are given. But their politicians are world-class examples of the brass neck school of politics. They have been Putin apologists for years, and are now perhaps the closest to power of all the populist movements in Europe that have displayed unhealthy sympathies for Russia. But the party’s reaction to the West uniting against Putin’s brutal invasion of a sovereign state and the emergence of President Zelensky as a heroic and eloquent warrior for liberty was to change sides immediately.Without a blush, McDonald called for increased measures against Russia from the EU and “sanctions of such scale where there can be no doubt that Putin and his oligarch supporters will pay a huge price for choosing the course of military conflict over dialogue and diplomacy.”McDonald is a practised hand. In 2003, having become Gerry Adams’s protégé, she was tested for stardom by participating unapologetically in the annual ceremony at the statue of the IRA’s chief of staff, Sean Russell, who in 1940 died in a U-boat on his way back home after explosives training in Berlin.Her nickname for a time was “I believe Gerry”, the phrase she would trot out brazenly whenever anyone questioned his veracity. Her reward was to be appointed party president in 2018. And she is now hotly tipped to become taoiseach, Ireland’s prime minister.She has led Sinn Fein in its recent volte faces on the EU (which it opposed bitterly until about a decade ago) abortion, same sex marriage and a plethora of progressive causes, and mostly has managed to keep closed the cupboard with all the skeletons.Since she is in the US on a very public St Patrick’s Day charm offensive this week, it was a good day for bad news. Challenged in New York on the website deletions, she explained that this was just a routine overhaul – a housekeeping matter.She told a crowd at Fordham University that the “outbreak of conflict in Europe reminds us that peace, self-determination and sovereignty are precious and can never be taken for granted. Ireland understands the damaging and isive legacy wrought by colonisation, occupation and the denial of self-determination.” Putin would be proud of her.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spare existential angst ineluctable decline west","story":"There we were, two years ago, fretting about the onset of what was already described as a pandemic but which had yet to take a grip. By and large, things were not that bad at all. The racing fraternity had gathered en masse at Cheltenham for the great National Hunt annual meeting, mostly oblivious to the public health calamity that was about to ensue.That event was subsequently seen as a great seeder of Covid, as was Liverpool’s Champions League match with Atlético Madrid around the same time. Back then we called them “super-spreader” episodes because it stood to reason that thousands of people milling together must pass on easily transmissible illnesses.But while that is demonstrably true, the pandemic would have happened even if Cheltenham had been cancelled. The virus was already here, brought in by visitors and skiers returning from the Alpine slopes.Two years ago today we were still a week away from a total lockdown, a delay for which Boris Johnson continues to be lambasted, even though all the evidence shows it made no difference.Britain’s excess fatalities for the period are no worse than most similar countries and yet at the time we were encouraged to believe this was a uniquely British disaster. We were “Plague Island” and yet it turns out that UK the death toll was below average for western Europe.This propensity for doing ourselves down has grown over time. When I was young, the narrative of national exceptionalism was strong. Empire, victory in war and epic tales of great adventurers were celebrated not condemned. Patriotism was a virtue not a sin.Men were men and women were women and no one had any difficulty telling which was which. Over the decades, as prosperity has grown, life s have been extended and we have become used to comfort and plenty, another disease has eaten into the body politic, that of declinism.In Britain, this led to our joining the Common Market in a belief that, without pooling sovereignty with our continental neighbours, we were doomed to perpetual weakness. The establishment was obsessed with the idea of joining this club, even if it meant cutting our close ties with countries with which we had more in common, both culturally and emotionally, such as Australia and Canada.The point is that there is always something to cause anguish and collective heartache, but what is important is to react in a proportionate way. We are currently in an extended bout of dread-filled angst that began with the financial crash of 2008 when it looked like the entire global banking system would fall over.I thought we would be pushing our belongings around some dystopian world in a shopping trolley like the father in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. It didn’t happen, although we came close.Then came Brexit, which half the country was convinced would lead to economic collapse, a run on the pound, the diminution of the UK as an influential world power and a permanent severing of our links with Europe. None of these happened either, nor were they ever likely to, but exaggeration is another character trait we find hard to avoid.No sooner was Brexit “done”, than news came through from China of a novel coronavirus with the potential to spread rapidly from person to person. Not that the Chinese admitted as much at the time, any more than they were upfront about its provenance, which is increasingly believed to have been a leak from a laboratory in Wuhan.Then, as the pandemic abated and restrictions were finally removed – with February 20 dubbed “Freedom Day” here in England – that ominous noise we could hear from a far-off land was of Vladimir Putin’s tanks rumbling towards Ukraine. Just when it seemed like life was getting back on an even keel, Covid is beginning to look like a walk in the park.Now the worry that keeps us awake at night is not just the plight of the poor Ukrainians or the wider economic consequences of the war, but the renewed threat of Armageddon. The shadow of the nuclear bomb, under which we lived during the Cold War, has returned to cast a pall over all of our lives.A friend said to me the other day that he had never felt so depressed about events, which made me think that, in reality, we had lived through a golden age. Our parents had been bombed in the war and grown up when diseases like polio and diphtheria were still rife. Their fathers had been conscripted to fight in the “war to end all wars’’ which it turned out not to be. If they were shot or otherwise wounded, they had to endure the risk of infection long before the discovery of penicillin.There has hardly been any time in history that has offered as benign an existence as that enjoyed by those of us born in the late 1950s and 1960s into a stable, democratic country like ours. We were not even called up to do National Service, let alone required to fight in a war. This applies not just to Baby Boomers who subsequent generations think got all the breaks. Those born since have had a few, too.Most of us who have grown up since the Second World War have come to expect a steady state of prosperity, stability and contentment beyond the imagination of previous generations. We have lost a sense of historical perspective by overreacting to events precisely because life has, by and large, been good for most people most of the time.The Hobbesian reality is that, for the greater part of man’s existence, wars, famines, pestilence and disaster were the norm just as they still are in some parts of the world. Across Europe and Asia, people happily minding their own business have for centuries suddenly had their worlds snuffed out by Romans or Saxons or Vikings or Normans or Mongols or a succession of Continental armies.In most of Europe it was commonplace to feel that your life was about to be torn apart, your entire savings lost and that a new reality would emerge to take the place of the old. This misery is now being visited upon Ukraine, whose citizens just three weeks ago were looking forward to the arrival of spring.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Three million people have fled Ukraine, says UNBoris Johnson under pressure to raise Jamal Khashoggi killing with Saudi Crown PrinceStrip search of 15-year-old black schoolgirl by Met Police was \u0026#39influenced by racism\u0026#39‘Kleptocracy’ unit goes after Vladimir Putin’s millions of pounds of personal wealth stashed in LondonRiver quality target scrapped, despite public demands for cleaner waterWho is Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist and ex-state mouthpiece who turned on her Kremlin bosses?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"golden retriever adorably leaves owner","story":"Golden retriever adorably leaves owner for new family every time she goes outThree-year-old Layla has so much love to give she has to ditch her owner on walks to snuggle up with complete strangers - and they just cant get enough of her warm cuddlesthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video golden-retriever-ditches-owner-sit-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:TvsYGam,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But despite feeding, walking and smoothing them with affection, sometimes theyaposre more interested in spending time without you.One owner, who is regularly aposditchedapos by her dog when out on walks, has noticed how her golden retriever would rather spend time with stranger than stay by her side.Owner Maggie Daly, from New Jersey, has shared an sweet video of her three-year-old dog loving on complete strangers during their trips to the beach.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The video has racked in , likes on Instagram and has received hundreds of comments from dog lovers who just canapost get enough of Laylaaposs adorable antics.Maggie said: She does it whenever we go to the beach, which is pretty much everyday. She spots a person or group of people - typically when they are sitting down - and sprints toward them and sits down either right next to them or on their lap. I can usually tell right awaythe person or people are interested in having her invade their space or not andthey are not happy about it I call her back and she - most of the time - will come back or move on to the next group of people.  Most people seem happy about it and will pet her, take pictures with her, throw her ball for her. She will stay with a group for as long as they give her attention and then move on to another group of people. Having been aposloving on strangersapos since she was a puppy, Maggie was anxious about her dogaposs behaviour at first, worried she would be bothering people. I thought I needed to train it out of her but now I realise most people really enjoy her running over to say hi and spread a little love and she also enjoys the extra pets and hugs, she added. A person even commented on the video that her son was one of the people in the video and they had recently lost their golden retriever and he was so happy and thought it was his dog’s way of saying hi. Layla is said to have a larger than le personality and never fails to greet everybody who walks through her door with toys, pillows or blankets. Commenting on the video, one user said: It looked like first guy pulled out his phone to take a selfie and sweet pup leaned in like a pro for the picture. While another added: I hope I am somewhere that you are so I can get hugs. A third said: Your dog shares the love that you give her each day - thataposs a big talent and this is amazing.

It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed. Star power Putinaposs growing isolation was again underlined as stars expressed support for Ukraine at last night’s Baftas. Awards are great but Benedict Cumberbatch expressing solidarity with an invaded country reminds us what is really important.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

But the PM heads to Riyadh to beg bin Salman to increase oil production to help the West wean itself off Russian energy. He will make similar pleas to Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed in the neighbouring UAE, also guilty of human rights abuses. Mr Johnson said: “The UK is building an international coalition to deal with the new reality we face.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  “The world must wean itself off Russian hydrocarbons and starve Putin’s addiction to oil and gas. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are key international partners in that.”Pressed on whether the sht away from Russia meant dealing with other dangerous regimes, he said: “We want to build the widest possible coalition.”Ed Miliband, Shadow Secretary of State for Climate and Net Zero, said: “It is a sign of our vulnerability and energy insecurity as a country that the Prime Minister is going to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in oil production, despite the appalling human rights record.”  Polly Truscott, of Amnesty International UK, said: “Saudi oil shouldn’t be allowed to buy the world’s silence over Saudi’s terrible human rights record.” Mike Davis, of Global Witness, said: “Oil and gas drives conflict. Rather than run, cap in hand, to Riyadh, the PM should be focusing on how we can rapidly invest in renewable energy.” Conservative Julian Lewis, who chairs the Intelligence and Security Committee, called for assurances that the UK would not now become dependent on another “unreliable, sometimes hostile, regime”.  Katie Fallon of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said Britain’s weapons sales to Saudi had “emboldened” the kingdom to “commit violations” of humanitarian law in Yemen. Mr Johnson, who will travel overnight before starting in the UAE, wrote in thetoday: “As long as the West is economically dependent on Putin, he will do all he can to exploit that dependence... And that is why that dependence must – and will - now end.”Tory MPs today urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to combat “eye-watering” fuel costs by cutting duty.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartySheikh Mohammed bin ZayedBoris JohnsonEd MilibandJulian LewisHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain.

After she stopped taking the contraceptive pill, the pair hoped nature would take its course and Diana would soon fall pregnant. Before long, they got their wish and Diana, now , discovered she was expecting a baby. But tragically, she miscarried. The following year in , Diana was once again hopeful after falling pregnant for a second time, but suffered heartbreak again when she lost the baby. From the minute she stopped taking the pill, the hopeful mum realised something wasn’t right - and she went to the doctor with her concerns. “I’ve always had painful periods since I was a teenager. I went to see doctors but I was told, ‘some women get painful periods’,” she told The Mirror. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “I used to get very sharp pains in my lower abdomen but I noticed it wasn’t only during the days I was on my period - also at random times, mid-cycle.” Diana was told she was experiencing “ovulation pain” that would go away when she got pregnant - but until then, she should take the pill to manage it. When the pair decided to try for a baby and Diana stopped taking the pill, she says the pain came back. “I had pain passing stools and urine, I was bloated and was generally feeling unwell,” she said. Diana claims she went back to the doctor complaining of sharp pains in her abdomen and was just given antibiotics. But after two miscarriages, she was sure something more serious was wrong and was eventually sent to see a gynaecologist.  “An ultrasound scan showed cysts on my oies, fibroids and suspected endometriosis,” she said. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in and around the womb, and are thought to be more common in Black women. Endometriosis is a condition where the lining of the womb begins to grow in other places such as the oies or fallopian tubes. It can cause signicant pain and can result in dficulty getting pregnant. After a laparoscopy, it was confirmed Diana had endometriosis - and the lining of her womb was growing in her bladder, bowels, appendix and colon. “It was very scary,” Diana said.  “But I was relieved to finally have a reason for the stabbing pain that I had been having.” Diana and Moses kept trying for a baby, but they had no luck. Eventually their doctor referred the couple for fertility treatment and they began the process of IVF. However, due to Diana’s endometriosis, she also had to have several operations, including a myomectomy to remove the fibroids and womb lining. “The operations were to remove the endometriosis, resection of fibroids, removing the scarring caused by the endometriosis and unsticking the tubes which have been blocked by the endometriosis,” Diana explained. She added that during one operation, surgeons had even removed her appendix because there were signs of endometriosis there. Despite having to have more operations than she can count, Diana says she’s grateful for her “brilliant” consultant at TFP Wessex Fertility and doctors at Basingstoke Hospital.Read More While going through the physical toll of the operations, Diana also suffered three more miscarriages during her IVF journey. Determined not to give up, she and Moses tried again. But after Diana had her eggs collected on her last cycle, she realised something wasn’t right. “I was feeling very bloated and sore, I was in so much pain,” Diana said. “By the second night I was feeling so poorly and could hardly move. I hadn’t been passing much urine even though I’d been drinking a lot. “In the middle of the night I was struggling to breathe so I phoned an on-call doctor.” After speaking to the doctor, Diana was sent to the women’s ward. By now she was in so much pain she was “gasping for air.”  “They wheeled me straight in for an X-ray where they discovered I had lots of fluid in my lungs. “Back at the ward, I was surrounded by lots of doctors and they gave me an oxygen tube to help me breathe and strong pain medication.” Doctors told Diana she had oian hyperstimulation syndrome . OHSS is more likely to occur in women having IVF after taking hormones to stimulate egg production. It causes the oies to swell with eggs, which can be incredibly painful and cause blood clots. In rare, severe cases, it can be fatal. Feeling delirious from the painkillers, Diana said she didn’t understand how serious her condition was when doctors took her to intensive care. But she does remember seeing the results of her X-ray - which showed her right lung was submerged in fluid.  Doctors inserted a tube into Diana’s lung to drain the fluid, and thankfully she was allowed to leave intensive care three days later. After being sent home to recover from OHSS, Diana waited a few months before having embryos transferred into her womb in February .By March, she took a pregnancy test that came back positive.“I was excited but still apprehensive due to the previous miscarriages,” Diana said. She added she was also nervous because, throughout the pregnancy, the sharp pains in her abdomen never went away - despite what she’d been told by doctors in the past. She said: “Week by week as I had my scans, I was reassured that despite the pain I was having, the baby was ok. “First, we saw the sac on the ultrasound, and then the flickering heartbeat.” But when she finally reached the  week mark, Diana said she cried “tears of joy.” After a painful pregnancy during which Diana had to be scanned every fortnight, the couple welcomed their daughter Siimainto the world on the st November , and after nearly a decade of trying, the pair were finally parents. “I say this over and over again - I would go through all the surgeries, the pricks and the pain to have our beautul daughter,” Diana said. “She has a beautul personality and brings us so much joy. I think I’d be lost without her.” Despite her baby joy, Diana still lives with intense pain from endometriosis, which she believes has worsened since she gave birth. She is even considering a hysterectomy as she’s “tired of living with pain” which affects all aspects of her le. “Not only does it affect me physically, but also my lestyle and relationships with my friends and family,” she said. “PerhapsI was diagnosed earlier it would have been a dferent story. “The doctors were helpful but I think we need a lot more research and conversation so that women’s pain isn’t dismissed as ‘just period pain’.”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyMiscarriageIVFFertilityPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Many royal fans were also curious to know what the royal baby might look like, with some even going as far as using prediction websites to get an idea of how Princess Charlotte would look and the results were... a little creepy. The prediction site allows users to upload photos of both the mum and dad, which it uses to create a bizarre mash-up of how the child may look. Someone did exactly that, by using photos of Kate and Prince William to guess how Charlotte would look, and on reflection, the predictions were very, very wrong.

Gavin lives in the top floor flat in Glenburn with we Cherine, -year-old daughter Elisha, three-year-old Freya and Arya, who’s one, and has been left angered by being bounced around by Scottish Water and Renfrewshire Council, who are both investigating the source of the problem, the Daily Record reports.He said: “We’ve had problems with the water since October last year but it properly stopped two weeks ago.  “I’ve been phoning Renfrewshire Council and Scottish Water every day, I keep being bounced between the two of them. It feels like no-one is taking any interest. “We can’t wash our clothes or our dishes or ourselves. We were going to my in-laws and my family to wash but they’ve both got Covid now so we’re stuck. “We paid out of our own pocket to stay at the Glenfer Hotel but we can’t afford to keep doing that.” The issue has been made more complex by the fact Gavinaposs flat is privately owned, while the flats below are council-owned.  If the source of the water problem is in the garden then it falls to Renfrewshire Council to fix it. If it’s in the street, then it’s down to Scottish Water. The dad-of-three, who says he reported the issue on February , added: “I’ve got a stoma bag which I need to keep clean. We need to make bottles for our youngest. “They should be paying for us to stay in a local hotel. I shouldn’t have to be chasing them to find out what’s happening. “There are five of us in our flat, it’s utter bedlam.”A spokesperson for Renfrewshire Council said: “Investigations have been carried out in conjunction with Scottish Water since the issue was first identied.“We have now identied the source of a water leak, and this will be fixed as soon as possible.” A spokesperson for Scottish Water confirmed the issue was not with the public water system. He said: “In response to reports of issues affecting the water supply to Mr Divers’ home, our local team has attended and investigated. “On each occasion, we have confirmed that there are no issues affecting the public water network that Scottish Water maintains. “We have been liaising with Renfrewshire Council and with Mr Divers to inform them of our findings and provide advice. “In an effort to help in the interim, we have provided a supply of bottled water this week on a goodwill basis. We hope that this will assist while the situation affecting the building’s private pipework is resolved.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Housing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At the height of the pandemic, millions were plunged into online learning as schools remained open to vulnerable pupils and children of key workers only.Isolation of whole year groups then saw some children attend school for just a few days before being forced to isolate once again at home.A report from Englandaposs Childrenaposs Commissioner last week said the issue of identying where these aposmissing childrenapos were was an urgent problem.  Dame Rachel de Souza said: These findings shed light on a very concerning situation: we cannot identy where each child is. There are thousands of children who support services do not have contact with, and authorities are therefore unable to ensure their safety, wellbeing and learning. This is an urgent problem that requires immediate, collaborative and practical solution.Jonathan Green, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Manchester University explained to The Times how childrenaposs mental health may have been affected so badly by the lockdown, they are now finding it a huge struggle toto normal le - and even leave home to meet with friends. He also explained how children who were already deemed vulnerable and to whom school offered a respite from turbulent family homes were not at increased risk of becoming aposinvisibleapos. Prof Green said : Socially vulnerable children were a real concern and remain a real concern. In terms of this group of children who we have always been concerned about in terms of not being at school and sort of lost to sight - but there are lots more of them now. I would say there were three groups impacted. The first is a group who are prone to social anxiety and worries.  This pandemic exasperated a lot of these fears and anxieties and has caused a real legacy. Prof Green went on to explain how the second group of children are those who have neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities, such as children with autism. He explained how the Invisible nature of Covid was a huge issue for these children - who feared even leaving home for worries the wind could carry Covid and bring illness to them and their families - causing them to become obsessively worried Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsMental healthCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Later, Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mum for EmmaEmma Smuts-Muller and her best friend Laura DonohoeByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Mar |commentsOver the course of their -year friendship, Emma Smuts-Muller and Laura Donohoe have been there for each other through thick and thin.But now the pair share an even more special bond, after caring Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mother for her best friend - after being bridesmaid for her just months earlier. Emma saw her hopes of conceiving dashed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September  and had to undergo treatment which affected her fertility.But thanks to Laura, Emma is now the proud mum of miracle baby Ella and is looking forward to a bright future.“Laura and I have always had an amazing connection with each other since we met at school,” says -year-old Emma, who lives near Birmingham and works as a chief of staff for West Midlands Police. “My husband Thomas and I had realised just how ready we were to have a baby, but after having breast cancer that decision was taken away from us. I will never be able to repay Laura for what she’s done for my family and it’s brought us even closer together.” In May , Emma married Thomas, , with Laura, , by their side as a bridesmaid. Soon after ing from their honeymoon in Lake Como, Emma was delighted to discover that she was pregnant, but tragically miscarried just eight weeks later. The couple were dealt another blow when Emma’s father Terry was diagnosed with leukaemia, then, that September Emma found a mass in her right breast. Scans quickly confirmed the diagnosis of breast cancer.  “I’d had some soreness that I’d initially put down to being pregnant, but when I noticed the changes in my breast I had an instant gut feeling that it was something bad,” Emma recalls. “Thomas and I had been on a massive high after the wedding, and to get pregnant so quickly it felt like everything was going to plan, but to be dealt so many devastating problems one after the other was really dficult for our family. “I just felt myself go into fight mode. I tried to not think too far into the future because it would have been too overwhelming. I knew I had no option but to get on with le.” Emma underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy which started in November . The following April, Emma had a mastectomy which removed her right breast as well as the cm cancerous tumour, then she went on to have two weeks of radiotherapy. Desperate to become a parent, Emma had been told by doctors that the chemotherapy could affect her fertility so she’d been offered IVF before starting her cancer treatment. However, despite successfully freezing  embryos it became clear that it wouldn’t be an option for Emma to carry one of them herself.  Emma says: “Because my breast cancer was linked to hormones, I had oian supression treatment. I was also told I need to take tamoxen - which I am on for  years - to stop the cancer ing. Due to the previous treatment, and the fact tamoxen stops your oies working, I began to go into the menopause. “Doctors also don’t allow you to get pregnant on tamoxen, and due to my age, I would have potentially been too old to carry my own child once I stopped taking the medication.” Emma and Thomas began to explore the possibility of using a surrogate to conceive, then one night Laura, who has two daughters aged seven and  with her husband Rob, came over to their house and told them she would be willing to carry their child. “She just dropped it out there that she would consider being our surrogate, which took us both massively by surprise,” says Emma.“However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the plans were put on hold for a few months, and despite having such a long time to mull it over she didn’t change her mind. I was so grateful to her.”In February , Laura was implanted with one of Emma and Thomas’s embryos. The trio then had a nail-biting two-week wait until Laura could do a pregnancy test.“When she sent the picture of the positive test through, we were so shocked - but really delighted,” says Emma. “We did this part of the fertility treatment with a private clinic but the doctors there told us there was only a % chance of it working due partly to my age and us using a surrogate, so I had prepared for the worst.” On November , Ella was born with Emma by Laura’s side as she went through labour. “Ella was  days overdue, so she did keep us waiting - however, she was definitely worth the wait,” says Emma. “Laura was very clear with her own children that she was just helping myself and Thomas out, and they really understood that. “I never had any worries that Laura would bond with Ella and find it dficult to give her over to us. “We don’t know yet when we will tell Ella how she was born, but it’s such a positive experience however we describe it. Most of all, we want her to understand what a miracle she is.” Now, Emma will have a yearly mammogram and speaks to her oncologist every six weeks to make sure the cancer hasn’t ed. Most of all, she is enjoying being a mum. She adds: “After coming through such a dficult time, Thomas and I finally have something positive to focus on. Laura is an incredible human being for carrying Ella for us.” Breast Cancer Now support and fund research into the condition.

Both children attend Thomasapos Battersea in south London, with George in Year  and and Charlotte in Year , where insiders claim theyaposre treated like all the rest of the pupils, despite their royal status. To the world, theyaposre known as Prince George and Princess Charlotte, but while people at school are aware of their status, the children actually go by normal, non-royal names while at school.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Georgeaposs full name is George Alexander Louis, while is official title is His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, but at school he goes by George Cambridge. Similarly, Charlotteaposs full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, and her official title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, but at school she is simply known as Charlotte Cambridge.Their dad, Prince William, and uncle, Prince Harry, followed the same rule while at school, using Charlesapos title - Wales - as their surname. William and Harry also continued to use this moniker throughout their military careers. Meanwhile, at home, Kate Middleton has her own name for six-year-old Charlotte, which was revealed while she chatted to a fellow mum and her son during a trip to Northern Ireland in . Kate was speaking to Laura-Ann and her son Bertie, later sharing the exchange on Instagram : She asked how old Bertie is, and I said he is four and she said, aposOh, heaposs the same age as Lottie.apos She calls her Lottie!

The monarch pulled out of attending the Commonwealth Day service on Monday, a decision understood to be related to her comfort rather than a specic illness. She now regularly uses a stick and remarked during a r ecent Windsor audience “Well, as you can see, I can’t move”. Her Majesty has also just recovered from a bout of Covid and spent more than three months resting on doctors’ orders from October and only carrying out light duties after an overnight stay in hospital for tests. And editor of Majesty magazine, Joe Little, has suggested the head of state could be absent from key events in the royal calendar such as the Order of the Garter ceremony and Royal Ascot.Celebrations for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee are set for June over a busy four-day weekend including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral. It has not yet been confirmed which events the Queen will attend and how much she will be seen. Mr Little told PA: “At a service – you’re getting up and down – and it’s tricky. If Westminster Abbey wasn’t possible, it makes you wonder whether St Paul’s Cathedral will be possible during the main Jubilee celebrations. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .“Garter, Royal Ascot, big ceremonial events that involve her normally getting in and out of carriages and getting dressed up, I just feel that’s not going to be possible in the future. “But you know, a lot can happen between now and then and so we will think positive thoughts.” Mr Little also believes the Queenaposs diary will neverto its pre-pandemic days because of her age and her frailty. He added: “The programme will be pretty sparse. The Palace is clearly going to look at what’s planned and commit to as little as possible because the problem is obviously to do with mobility.  “The sht has been going on for some time and it’s been accelerated by the Covid situation. “Two years ago, the Commonwealth service was one of the last things the Queen did before moving to Windsor for the duration and of course, she’s never really come back. “The pandemic has in many ways slowed her down. The programme will never really get back to how it was pre-pandemic, I would say, because of her age and her frailty.”  He questioned whether the monarch, who turns  next month, will be mobile enough to hand out Maundy money to nearly  pensioners in April in keeping with an ancient Easter custom. “It seems very unlikely that the Queen will distribute Maundy money in the way she once did because it involves a lot of people and standing for quite some time. Unfortunately, I think those days are gone. She’s nearly ,” he said. But Mr Little added as long as the Queen remains “pin-sharp” mentally she will be able toas monarch, including dealing with her red boxes of papers. “The Queen always strives to be visible, and of course, given her frailty, she’s much less visible than she would perhaps like to be,” he said. “But the fact that she’s still able to perform the s of head of state – the paperwork, the messages, all the stuff that doesn’t require physical presence – so as long as she remains pin-sharp mentally then there’s no reason to think that she can’t fulfil much of her duties, but just in a less visible manner.” The Queen switched to on-screen engagements for much of the pandemic and recently carried out a number of virtual audiences, and a handful of in-person ones. She reaffirmed the pledge of service she made as a -year-old in her Commonwealth Day message on Monday, saying: “In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in , that my le will always be devoted in service.”Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the Queen’s future engagements.

The traumatic search by politan Police officers took place at the girlaposs school in the knowledge that she was menstruating and without another adult present, the safeguarding report revealed. It concluded that the strip search should never have happened, was unjustied and racism was likely to have been an influencing factor.According to the report, the impact on the secondary school pupil, referred to as Child Q, was profound and the repercussions obvious and ongoing. Family members described her as changing from a happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks, who now self-harms and needs therapy. Scotland Yard has apologised and said the incident should never have happened.  The Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review, published in March, was conducted by City  Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnershipfollowing the incident in late . It said police arrived at the school after being called by teachers, who said they were concerned that the teenager had drugs in her possession because she smelt of cannabis. She was taken to the medical room and strip searched by two female officers, while teachers remained outside. During the ordeal her intimate body parts were exposed and she was asked to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. No drugs were found. She was then sent home by taxi, later sharing her distress with her mother. Her family strongly believe the strip search was a racist incident, and the review found that her experiences are unlikely to have been the same had she not been black.  It said it is highly likely that aposadultication biasapos was a factor, where adults perceive black children as being older than they are because they see them as more aposstreetwiseapos. It reads: The disproportionate decision to strip search Child Q is unlikely to have been disconnected from her ethnicity and her background as a child growing up on an estate in Hackney. In a written statement to the review, the girl said she cannot go a single day without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up. She said: All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible. I was held responsible for a smell... but Iaposm just a child. The main thing I need is space and time to understand what has happened to me and exactly how I feel about it and getting past this exam season.She added: I need to know that the people who have done this to me canapost do it to anyone  ever again, in fact so no one  can do this to any other child in their care. Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, deputy mayor and cabinet member for Hackney Councilaposs Childrenaposs Services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said they were appalled by all aspects of the review. In a joint statement they said: Child Q was subjected to humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking treatment by police officers - actions that were wholly disproportionate to the alleged incident to which they had been called. This is exacerbated by the fact that the strip search was carried out at school - a place where the child had an expectation of safety, security and care. Instead, she was let down by those who were meant to protect her. The police must stop inexcusable behaviours and mindsets in order to properly serve all our erse communities, they added. They have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the reviewaposs eight findings and  recommendations. These include calls for the Department for Education to make more explicit reference to safeguarding in its guidance on searching, screening and confiscation, and for police guidance on strip searching children to clearly outline the need for a focus on safeguarding. The politan Police said the Independent Office for Police Conduct was investigating, following a complaint in May . Detective Superintendent Dan Rutland of the Metaposs Central East Command said: We recognise that the findings of the safeguarding review reflect this incident should never have happened. It is truly regrettable and on behalf of the Met Police I would like to apologise to the child concerned, her family and the wider community. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: It should shock everyone that a child can be strip searched with no safeguards in place. Whataposs also clear from this incident is that the reason these safeguards werenapost considered is because the child in question was black. All those involved in this horric incident must be urgently held to account.

Ukraine ’s Ministry of Defence showed the footage with the caption “game over Russian invaders” as the brutal battle continues and Vladimir Putin ’s army has found it dficult to break down the stf resistance.The Russian army is pounding cities around Ukraine with shells leading to thousands of casualties but they have also sustained high numbers of losses and there have been questions about the morale of their forces in attacking a country seen by many as their “brothers”.Ukrainians have fought for every inch of ground and have been inspired by President Volodymyr Zelensky who has rallied the people with daily updates and refused to leave the capital Kyiv.And the government has continued to post positive news on the battlefield including anew video where a Russian tank is blown up.The full message from the video published by the Ministry of Defence says: “th Separate Airborne Brigade Sicheslav Brigade aposgame overapos, Russian invaders! “The paratroopers continue to multiply the Moksha army to zero with accurate shots! We will win! Glory to Ukraine!” It is the latest video of attacks on invading forces with another, published by unveried accounts, having shown drones hitting a Russian armoured convoy in the city of Mariupol with a BTR- APC and a KamAZ- aposTyphoonapos vehicle both hit. The Ukrainian army has also posted a video of a Russian command centre being hit by a drone near Vasylivka.  At the same time Russian shelling has caused heavy losses with the confirmed civilian toll in Ukraine at  people killed and , injured, the United Nations human rights office said, adding the true figures were probably considerably higher. About three million people have fled Ukraine, nearly half of them children, according to the UN refugee agency. About . million are now in Poland and some , in Western Europe. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that the positions of Ukraine and Russia at peace talks were sounding more realistic, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.Meetings continue. I am told that the positions at the negotiations sound more realistic, Zelenskiy said in a video address released early on Wednesday, the agency said. However, more time is still needed for decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine.

Scotland has seen a sharp rise in new cases, with parts of the country accounting for the UKaposs worst hotspots.Experts now believe the BA. sub-iant of Omicron - which has been branded Stealth Omicron - accounts for % of Covid cases in Scotland.It has a faster rate of transmission than the original version of Omicron - although it is not thought to lead to more severe illness. The latest Department of Health data shows , people have tested positive for Covid in the past seven days across the UK, up , since yesterday.Cases over the past seven days are .% higher than the week before, with , more confirmed infections. Each of the  towns and cities with the highest infection rates are in Scotland, with Na h-Eileanan Siar recording a rate of ,. cases per , people - two-and-a-half times the rate in Englandaposs worst hotspot. Today First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament: The increase in cases over the past three weeks has been driven by the BA. sub-lineage of the Omicron iant, which is estimated to be signicantly more transmissible - with a growth rate since mid-February perhaps % greater than original Omicron. BA. is now our dominant strain, accounting for more than % of all reported cases.  BA. has become dominant in Scotland earlier than in England and Wales, hence the more rapid increase in cases here than south of the border in recent weeks - although cases and hospital admissions are now rising sharply again in England too. Department of Health data shows , people were in hospital with the virus on Monday, of which  were in ventilation beds. NHS chiefs in England have previously said that just under half of those admitted with the virus were primarily being treated for another condition.

Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the legal requirement for businesses to keep customersapos details in case these are needed for contact tracing will end as planned on Monday, March . But speaking about requirements on the wearing of face coverings, she said: Given the current spike in case numbers, we consider it prudent to retain this requirement in regulation for a further short period. The First Minister added: Ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly. The legal requirement will be reviewed again in two weeksapos time, she added, with Ms Sturgeon saying the expectation was that it will become guidance rather than the law in early April. She went on to tell MSPs that advice on testing would also change next month, saying that from April  we will no longer advise people without symptoms to test twice-weekly.

On the face of it, the sweet snap is simply lining up the future of the British Monarchy, but royal author Andrew Morton claims it caused upset behind palace walls. The royal couple suspected that the entire institution was conspiring against them. As they saw it, the evidence was all around them, he writes, in an updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess. The unspoken code was straightforward: the future of the monarchy was assured, with or without Meghan and Harry. These fears were later said to be confirmed when the Queen cancelled a meeting with Harry, in which heaposd wanted to discuss his royal future, Morton claims. This sense that, despite their international popularity, they were low down the royal totem pole was confirmed when Harry arranged to meet the Queen for a grandson-to-grandmother chat in early January, he writes. At the last minute the meeting was postponed. Harry suspected classic internal politics, his family concerned that anything the Queen agreed during informal conversations would be used by Harry as a negotiating tactic.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. It was days later, on January , when Harry and Meghan made their shock announcement that they would be stepping back from senior roles within the royal family. Taking to social media to tell the world, the couple said theyaposd spent many months reflecting over their decision, adding that they had plans to carve out a progressive new role within [the] institution while becoming financially independent. Since then, Harry and Meghan have spoken publicly about their decision to leave, first when Harry appeared on The Late Late Show with James Cordon and then in their shock interview with Oprah Winfrey.While touring around LA on an open top bus with Cordon, Harry said: It was never walking away. It was stepping back rather than stepping down. It was a really dficult environment, as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like.It was destroying my mental health. I was like, this is toxic. So I did what any husband and any father would do, I need to get my family out of here. But we never walked away. As far as Iaposm concerned, whatever decisions are made on that side, I will never walk away. I will always be contributing. But my le is service, so wherever I am in the world itaposs always going to be the same thing. Harry and Meghanaposs subsequent interview with Oprah sent shock waves across the world, as they spoke about Meghanaposs poor mental health during her time at the Palace and claims an unnamed royal asked inappropriate questions regarding Archieaposs skin tone.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Four Legs - a pop-up restaurant operating at pub The Compton Arms in Islington shared a message from a blogger asking for five takeaway meals in exchange for an advertisement on their Instagram Stories. The influencer approached the restaurant over Direct Message, explaining how they were looking for a takeaway for them and their pandemic aposbubbleapos, infor a post. They also offered toto the pub, once it has reopened, and potentially share a photo of their food on their Instagram feedit could blend. But rather cheekily they found themselves directed to a police station after the request to the chef duo backfired. The exchange of messages was shared on Instagram last year by Four Legs, with the caption: Been reading a lot about the peasant’s revolt recently. Inspiring stuff.The influencer wrote: I am reaching out to askit would be possible to have a takeaway and in exchange for this Iaposll be happy to advertise you via my Instagram stories alongside a swipe up linkyou have a website to direct my followers to your website in the hope of it leading to an order. In another message, they askedthey could order food for their bubble alongside them - making a total of five meals. Appearing to go along with it, Four Legs replied: Thataposs quite a lot of food,you could do a couple of posts then we can do it - youaposve got a lot of followers. They directed the influencer to head over for half six, adding: Thanks very much man, itaposs really appreciated. Appearing a bit lost, the influencer wrote back: Walked past NHS. I see  police vans. Past Sainsburyaposs. Four Legs replied: Yeah itaposs that end, head up there, let me know when you see the police station, which the influencer duly did. But he swtly realised he wasnapost getting a takeaway as the chef team replied: Magic - go in there and report yourself for crimes against the hospitality industry. The message exchange was shared on Instagram, where it racked up thousands of likes. Food critic Marina OaposLoughlin commented: Absolutely KILLER. Another commenter joked: Ironically, telling this egg where to go has actually got you guys more exposure than feeding a whole gang of lame influencers for free could ever get you!

Shabaz Ali, of Blackburn, Lancashire, has made a number of claims about things he learned during his days behind the counter. Amongst other claims, he has said that baristas use coffee syrup rather than real coffee in Frappuccinos, while alleging that they also serve decaf coffee to rude customers. Shabaz, , who now works as a teacher, has also advised customers as to how to get themselves some free goodies from Starbucks - including free drinks and baked goods. The ex-barista says he began working for the world-famous coffee brand back in , and really enjoyed his time there, being a fan of Starbucks to this day. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In a fascinating TikTok video that has clocked up more than , views and over , likes, Shabaz has now shared alleged insider knowledge from his barista days.Shabaz said: I was going through training and the manager told me about purposely writing names on the cups wrong for free publicity. [They also told me] to look out for influencers or younger people who seem the type to make a scene about it on social media, as they’ll definitely post about it.I was shocked, as this was probably the reason my name would be spelled wrong in the past. Frappuccinos don’t have espresso coffee they have a fake flavour version – soyou want real coffee, you have to ask for an espresso shot. He added: I was also told to pretend that something wasn’t in stockit would hold up a queue. Frappuccinos would usually take a long time to make, so on a busy day, I would tell them some syrups were out of stock or the ice machine was broken. This really shocked me, as I know other companies must do this as well.He went on to reveal a few hints and tips to bag Starbucks freebies, including free beverages and has also explained exactly what happens to leftover items. Shabaz said: You get a free drink on your birthdayyou tell the barista. At the end of the night, the bakery items need to be thrown out – soyou ask a barista, they might give these away to you. Some of this is taken to homeless shelters or given to the homeless, but most stores just bin food waste. If someone is a regular, you can give them syrups and other goodies for free. Most food is tried by the staff before it comes out, so always ask for their recommendations. They will also try a combination of all sorts and have their own secret special drinks, so ask them for advice and they’ll always get you what you want. He added: Drip filter coffee can be refilled for freeyou sit in. If you hate your drink, ask for another one, as the barista will always change this for you. If you ask for a medium drink, but want it in a large cup, chances are the barista will fill the cup for you because they always make a bit extra – so you get a large drink for free. Sadly, some Starbucks customers may be dismayed to learn that, according to Shabaz, there is no secret menu.Aghast fans have since expressed their surprise at some of the more unexpected revelations, with one person commenting, the decaf bit scared me. Another remarked, I heard the name thing but wasnapost fully sure, glad to get a confirmation, while a third person laughed, “I said my name’s Michelle they wrote McHale.

She was asked to be a bridesmaid for her sisteraposs wedding but was shocked to learn the ceremony was set to be aposchild freeapos, and she had recently had a baby. In the end, the woman told her sister thatshe wanted her there and didnapost want children at the wedding then she would have to change the date - and now the family are ided. What do you think about the brideaposs demands  Let us know in the comments... Taking to Reddit, the would-be bridesmaid wrote: She got upset but left it for a few days and then came back to me, asking why.My daughter is exclusively breastfed, every three hours, and wonapost take a bottle under any circumstance . So I quite literally canapost leave her. She got upset and said the baby would take the bottleshe got hungry enough, which I disagree with.

She continued: It was more arguing, I stated, aposthen youaposll just have to reschedule your weddingapos in response to her saying I need to be there. She got huffy and left, and ever since then family members have been treating me like I told her Iaposd kill her firstborn.The poster - who goes by the username u aitaweddit - went on the explain how sheaposd also made it clear to her sister that finding childcare for her eldest daughter would also be dficult, given that sheaposs autistic and has pretty severe meltdowns.

Her fellow Reddit users have since sympathised with her dficult situation, with one person reasoning: Although it is reasonable to have a child free wedding, she knew damn well youaposd have a baby by then. Could she not make an exception for newborns though   Itaposs not like they cause chaos by running around and carrying on! They mostly sleep. Another wrote: If she really wanted you there she would make accommodations for your children. They didn’t just suddenly appear, she’s known all along that you can’t leave them. Depending where she’s getting married, especiallyit’s a lodging or dedicated wedding venue, it’s not that hard to hire a babysitter who will keep the kids onsite, but not at the wedding.

The space agency says thereaposs nothing to be worried about as itaposs one of a dozen scheduled to fly past this week. Even though the speedy object has been added to the space agencyaposs Close Approaches database they have been quick to stress it poses little dangers.  Any space object that comes within almost five million miles of us is automatically considered potentially hazardous. The  DP will make its way towards Earth imminently, but it isnapost going to come too near.  The distance it will approach is roughly three times the space between Earth and the Moon. The space experts have moved to calm any fears and say there wonapost be any close calls in our letime.Nasa knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small, NASA said. In fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.  Earlier this month an asteroid, which NASA says is up to ,ft wide, flew past without a problem. Almost four times bigger than the Efel Tower and the Shard, it barely registered. The magnitude of the asteroid is recorded at .H which refers to the visual magnitude an observer would recordit were placed  Astronomical Unit away. It was first found in February  by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project in New Mexico, USA, and last seen near Earth in February . The rock has been approaching the planet on an almost yearly basis and is due to come back again next February and April.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

Harbour for more than  years, catching a iety of shellfish such as lobster, brown crab and whelk.The fishing industry was one of the hardest hit by the compounded effects of Brexit and lockdown but the family-run business has managed to turn a potential hurdle into a success.Lawrie said: “When lockdown just kicked in, that was the end of the foreign markets.“We had been thinking about changing how we operate but that forced us.“We had it in our mind to start selling privately because of Brexit as well and it all just came together, and we’ve not really looked back.”Lawrie and Eddie have now shted their business to much more of a local focus, selling their catch to restaurants and the public in the local area while also offering a delivery service.Lawrie said: “Everything was shipped into Europe beforehand but now we are selling direct to restaurants mainly in Edinburgh and a few places in East Lothian.“Everything we catch gets sold within  miles so instead of shipping into France, Spain and wherever , it’s nice for us to see what the stuff that we catch is being used for.”In Scotland it is not illegal to catch egg-bearing lobsters, but Lawrie believes this is harmful for the long-term viability of the industry and promotes a far more sustainable model.“We see that as madness that we are taking away that stock for the future, so we’ve completely eliminated that and we don’t keep any egg bearing females at all, they go straight back in the sea, straight away,” he said.“The creels that we use are recycled plastics so in that respect we are more sustainable with the materials that we use.”Lawrie also added that they were looking into using electric vans to help reduce their carbon footprint, which has already been greatly reduced by their new local model.“Because we are selling locally, that’s food miles that’s being cut down as well,” he added.The new model has also allowed everyone at Belhaven Lobster to become more involved locally and reconnect with the community at a personal level.Lawrie said: “During the first lockdown, people were looking for things to get out of the house for, a reason to go and try something a bit dferent.“So when we were selling direct to the public, you got to speak to people, connect with people and get their story and what they were planning to do with the shellfish that we catch.“They were getting our side of the story as well, and they were interested to find out how we catch them and where we catch them.“It was good for the customers, good for us and I think it has benefited the harbour in general as well.”Archerfield House by Dirleton is one of the venues that Belhaven Lobster supplies, with executive chefs David Jamieson and Joe Queen dedicated to using locally sourced goods.Joe said: “It’s just a great company to deal with.“In all sorts of weather, we are guaranteed to get the product we are after and to deal with they are just great guys that want to look after the customers.“We wanted them involved because they are so good, they are friendly but it’s the consistency of the product.“We need it kept local we need it kept home.“There’s always a need, especially for shellfish, in any decent restaurant.“We have a great relationship now, and long may it continue.”While the Belhaven Lobster team are not sure where the future may take them, they are eager to keep growing and expanding.Lawrie said: “Hopefully we are going to keep going with what we are doing andwe can pick up more and more restaurants and customers then that’s great.“We can hopefully try and expand a little bit more and see where it takes us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-plants-tree-jubilee","story":"Roderick Urquhart, Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, was joined by the youngest and oldest pupils at the village’s

The faculty heads meanwhile may only be qualied to teach one of the subjects for which they are responsible. This has meant a loss of crucial subject expertise and experience.In addition, the principal teachers, as key middle managers, played an absolutely vital part in the effective running of the school. I know from experience the value of the advice and guidance of the school’s principal teachers. I feel strongly that the loss of these posts cannot be helping the academic performance of Scotland’s secondary schools.Furthermore, as suggested in your article, the marked reduction in promoted posts in secondary schools seriously restricts career development for teachers and must be a disincentive for recruitment. When I started teaching there was a clear career structure for teachers as they moved from being a class teacher to a principal teacher, with assistant principal teacher posts created for the larger subject departments. For those teachers who wished to move into school leadership, the progression was from principal teacher to assistant head teacher, then to deputy head teacher before becoming a head teacher. This was a long apprenticeship which was a thorough preparation for the demanding job of head teacher. Compare this to the present structure where a teacher moves to the position of faculty head and then a deputy before being promoted to head teacher. This represents a signicant loss of opportunities for promotion as well as key stages in the preparation for headship.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.GREEN INVESTMENT IS NOT A RACKETBRIAN Wilsonattempts to make the case against current land ownership in Scotland suggesting that the term \"laird\" should be confined to soap operas set in big houses awash with tartan. On that point we are in complete agreement. Laird is a hopelessly anachronistic term and does not reflect that the vast majority of landowners are today running rural businesses which strive to make a positive social, economic and environmental contribution to Scotland. Where we unfortunately part company is over the suggestion that investment in natural capital, or green investment, is some kind of \"racket\". To portray green investment as a \"racket\" being perpetrated by so-called ‘green lairds’fails to reflect reality on the ground.Private owners, whether they are families who have been around for generations or are an investment company new to landownership, are helping government to tackle climate change by increasing forestry cover, providing clean energy and restore peatlands to lock up carbon, as well as continuing to supply affordable rural housing, local jobs and produce world-class food and drink and tourism experiences.We should not fall into the trap of pitting one land use against another. Tackling climate change is of paramount importance and can be addressed in combination with other land uses.Mr Wilson is right, though, to point to the soaring price of land, which is an issue not just in Scotland.The foremost reason for land price inflation is the Chancellor’s response to the global financial crisis and the pandemic, which was to pump money into an economy which was in recession. This produced a spike in asset prices across the world, not just in land but pretty much across all asset classes.If we are to reach net zero, Scotland will necessarily see some new types of landowners, hopefully communities but also financial institutions. I hope that these institutions will all become members of Scottish Land  Estates and follow the standards of best practice in responsible landowning which our members practice across Scotland.Mark Tennant, Chairman, Scottish Land  Estates, Musselburgh.Could Queen Mary sink Waverley YOU report the possibleof TS Queen Mary to sailing again on the Clyde .One wondersthe potential market is sufficiently strong to successfully sustain two large pleasure craft at this location.

Lateral flow tests will also stop being freely available to the general population from April  Ms Sturgeon said this was “as far as we can go within funding constraints” following the UK Government’s decision to slash the budget for Covid testing, which had ballooned to £ billion a month by January. She said: “Our intention is that from end April all routine population-wide testing will end, including for those who have symptoms. “Contact tracing will end at this point too - although people with symptoms of respiratory illness will be advised to stay at home.“Physical test sites will close at the end of April - although mobile testing units and lab capacity will be retained for our longer term testing purposes.“We will do everything we can to support those who have worked on the testing programme during the transition. I want to thank all of them for their invaluable contribution over the last two years.“From  May, instead of a population wide approach, we will use testing on a targeted basis - to support clinical care and treatment and protect higher risk settings and for surveillance, outbreak management and responding to signicant developments, such as a new iant.“Let me stress that for any purpose for which we continue to advise testing, access to tests will, in Scotland, remain free of charge.”Ms Sturgeon said the current surge in infections has been driven by the BA. strain of Omicron, which now accounts for more than  per cent of cases in Scotland and is estimated to be around % more transmissible than the BA. lineage which first became dominant in December. : Is general practice about to face its biggest shake up in history of NHS This is putting “signicant pressure” on hospitals which are required to isolate Covid patients in separate wards - eventhey have mild or no symptoms - reducing the number of beds available for non-Covid care. NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian have more Covid patients now than at any time in the pandemic, while NHS Lanarkshire has warned that its three acute hospitals are operating beyond capacity.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says its hospitals are also near capacity, while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled.However, there is no evidence that BA. causes more severe disease and Ms Sturgeon noted that the recent rise in cases and hospital admissions “has not translated into a commensurate increase in cases of severe illness requiring intensive care”, adding that vaccines - much more so than Omicron being an “inherently milder” strain of Covid - meant that the “link between infection and serious health harm has weakened considerably”.There are currently  Covid patients in intensive care in Scotland. By contrast, Ms Sturgeon pointed to the current situation in Hong Kong “where relatively low rates of vaccination, particularly in the older population, mean that Omicron is causing very signicant levels of severe illness and death”. Hong Kong and New Zealand both pursued zero Covid policies, but % of over-s were unvaccinated when Omicron began spreading in Hong Kong compared to just % of over-s in New Zealand However - unlike New Zealand, where mortality remains low - Hong Kong failed to maximise vaccination coverage among its elderly.Two thirds of over-s were still unvaccinated against Covid when Omicron began spreading there in January - seeded by infected travellers and aircrew  who flouted quarantine. Hong Kong’s death rate per million over the past seven days is higher than that recorded by any other country at any point in the pandemic. Nearly one in every  confirmed cases population-wide is resulting in a death.In comparison, analysis in England suggests that a combination of vaccine protection, natural immunity and Omicron means that, for the UK, Covid is now less lethal than flu.“This underlines the vital importance of vaccination,” said Ms Sturgeon, as she confirmed that ‘second boosters’ will be rolled out to all over-s starting next week.Elderly care home residents began receiving theirs last week.  "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-urged-follow-suit-westminster-announces-legal-aid-funding-boost","story":"The UK Government announced plans for £ million in additional legal aid funding on Tuesday following an independent review of the system.The Law Society of Scotland is now calling for Scottish ministers to follow suit in a bid to resolve the mounting legal aid problem north of the border.Lawyers have long been calling for a substantial increase in funding, with solicitors staging protest action at courts across the country in recent months.The Scottish Government last week announced that it would provide a “signicant increase” in fees, but this was quickly shot down by lawyers who said the “small uplt” barely covered the recent increase in inflation.Following the Westminster funding announcement, Ian Moir, Law Society criminal legal aid convener, said: “The UK Government has recognised that legal aid in England and Wales needs signicant additional resource.  After a decade of underfunding, the Scottish Government needs to follow suit otherwise we risk deepening the access to justice crisis that is already affecting the most vulnerable in our society.“The issues south of the border mirror those we currently face in Scotland.” He added: “In Scotland, we are four years on from an independent review of legal aid, and almost a year on from a fee  project that recommended further research.

It will be reviewed again in two weeks’ time.The law on masks, which applies to public transport and enclosed public spaces, was due to be converted to guidance on March .However, the legal requirement for certain premises to retain customer contact details will be dropped as planned.The decision comes as the spike in cases means that one in  Scots have Covid.The First Minister said: “Given the current spike in case numbers, we consider it prudent to retain this requirement in regulation for a further short period.“I know this will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day care services.“However, ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection – particularly for the most vulnerable – at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly.”However, the requirement for businesses to collect customer details for track and trace purposes will be lted on Monday. Ms Sturgeon said that the Scottish Government “reluctantly agreed” to lt all international travel restrictions for Scotland this week at a four-nation meeting on Monday.From am on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to complete passenger locator forms under the change.Non-vaccinated travellers will cease having to take pre-departure and day two PCR tests, or complete locator forms.The changes will only apply to incoming travellers, and passengers should continue to check gov.uk for the latest information on requirements in other countries when travelling abroad.The transition period for coronavirus testing in Scotland will continue until the end of April, Nicola Sturgeon has said.The First Minister said “this is as far as we can go within funding constraints”, taking account of current case numbers.She said she was aiming for the same “long-term position as England”.Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament: “For the next month – until Easter – there will be no change to our testing advice.“If you don’t have symptoms, you should continue for now to use a lateral flow test twice weekly daily for seven daysyou are a close contact of a positive case and before visiting someone who is vulnerable.“If you have symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test, either at a testing site or by post.“However, following the Easter weekend – from April  – we will no longer advise people without symptoms to test twice weekly.”She said that until the end of April, the Government will continue to advise those with symptoms to get a PCR test.Contact testing will end at the end on April  and physical Covid testing sites will close at the end of April.Ms Sturgeon continued: “From May , instead of a population-wide approach, we will use testing on a targeted basis – to support clinical care and treatment and protect higher risk settings and for surveillance, outbreak management and responding to signicant developments, such as a new iant.” "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmFace coverings are to continue to be worn on public transport and most indoor public settings until at least early April, after the Scottish Government rowed back on plans to lt the legal restrictions on mask wearing.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It feels like we are going in the opposite direction.The Reds bow out of the #UCL#MUFC— Manchester UnitedMarch , “The next man might not be the right man, but the people behind the scenes have to make sure he is the right man.“Maybe they need a manager that they are going to be afraid of and that will scare them into performances.”Interim manager Ralf Rangnick is set to move into a consultancy role at the end of the season, having been appointed to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout while a permanent successor is found.Scholes, though, is not convinced by the German’s current position.“I don’t want to keep having a go at Ralf Rangnick, he seems really nice and comes across well in interviews, he’s very honest, but, how he was chosen to be manager of this club for six months until the end of the season, I’ll never know,” Scholes said.“The coach is a massive part of it. This isn’t a terrible group of players. I thinkyou give this group of players a structure and way of playing, there’s some real talent in the squad.”Scholes added: “The very first thing this club needs to do, to get anywhere near winning the league again, is get a proper coach.“Get a coach that suits the players, give them two or three years to build a squad of players that will challenge.”Former United defender Rio Ferdinand cannot see a positive ending to the current campaign.“For Man United, the season to me seems over – what is there to really achieve ” Ferdinand said on BT Sport.⏰ RESULT ⏰🔴⚪️ Atlético progress - on aggregate thanks to Renan Lodis first-half header…🔝 Who impressed at Old Trafford #UCL— UEFA Champions LeagueMarch , “ are floundering behind Arsenalthey win their games in hand.“Tonight was really a reflection of what the season has been like – there have been moments where they have been good, but far too often it is Jekyll and Hyde performances.

It was also translated into the most commonly spoken languages of families in the area.Another positive impact involved providing intervention and support from social workers for pupils with persistent absenteeism, such as providing an older “walking buddy” to accompany them to schoollack of transport was an issue.The paper noted that all but three of the studies took place in the United States, and they were all carried out before the pandemic.It concluded there was a lack of clear evidence about what works in reducing absenteeism, with both the EEF and Youth Endowment Fund using their new funding round to develop evidence on effective methods for raising attendance.The paper noted that attendance is a growing issue – in  , poor attendance was reported as .% overall, with special schools having a higher rate equal to .% and persistent absence at .% in England.Professor Becky Francis, chief executive of the EEF, said: “We know that pupils who are persistently absent from school are less like to achieve well academically.“But as today’s new evidence review shows, we know much less about the best ways to improve attendance.“While the research finds some positive impacts for approaches like engaging with parents and addressing the inidual needs of pupils, overall, the evidence on what works for reducing absenteeism is weak.“Teachers deserve a much clearer picture of how best to support their pupils who are persistently absent. Our new funding round with the Youth Endowment Fund will help fill some of these evidence gaps, by identying and evaluating promising interventions, programmes, and approaches.”Jon Yates, chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund , said: “Being away from school not only limits a child’s ability to succeed academically, but also puts them at risk of criminal exploitation or trapped in dangerous home environments.”“Absences from school means that children can’t receive the support they might need from their teachers or pastoral staff, which could help to keep them from harm. Simply put, to keep children safe, we need to know how best to keep them in school.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that the “pupils most likely to be absent from school are often those who are vulnerable and struggle the most in education”.He added that improving these pupils’ attendance was “vital to improving their outcomes and le chances”. While schools worked hard to do this already, the EEF findings showed they lacked firm evidence about which approaches worked.“However, this issue is not only about the approaches that are used, it is also about the resources that are available,” he said.“Over the past decade, central government has decimated the funding for local authority education support services, reducing the capacity of these services to support pupils and parents and to tackle persistent absence.

Helping women to drink less or no alcohol during their pregnancy will reduce the number of children and young people affected by FASD.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-267-todays-wordle-word-13-march-hints-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

These orders include  Zero Emission Buses which will soon be on our roads.Minister Mallon said: “I am committed to delivering cleaner, greener, sustainable infrastructure. I have been clear that tackling the climate crisis is a priority for me and I am committed to building a better future where we make zero low emission public transport accessible to communities across the North. My efforts are focused on making public transport carbon net zero as quickly as possible by delivering a step change on this journey to a greener future. “This is a future where our public transport leaves behind a reduced carbon footprint on our planet and where the air we breathe is cleaner as we tackle the climate crisis rather than exacerbate it.“In line with this commitment I previously allocated funding of almost poundmillion for the purchase of  zero and low emission buses for the Translink fleet. The first of these are due to go into passenger service in the next few weeks which will be another exciting milestone on this journey to net zero. When all the buses arrive and are in service Translink will have the fourth largest fleet across these islands of zero emission buses.“In November I was also delighted to announce additional funding of poundmillion for the purchase of  new zero emission battery electric buses for the Foylefleet. “This signicant leap will see the city’s entire urban fleet replaced with electric buses making it one of the first cities across these islands to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet when all the vehicles go into passenger service in .“Wrightbus are delivering both these signicant projects for us so I am delighted to be here today to see at first hand the expertise and technology they use and to meet with the staff helping us drive forward cleaner, greener public transport across the North for now and for future generations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"is northern ireland on track to reach its climate change targets","story":"The road to net zero is littered with obstacles as political parties lock horns over a ban on smoky coal and other environmental issues.

In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest EnvironmentUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestionLatestMarvel stands with LGBT community following passing of controversial US billFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedRalf Rangnick says referee made it easy for Atletico to do ‘time-wasting antics’Kylie Jenner says postpartum after birth of son was ‘not easy mentally’Paul Scholes stresses the importance of Manchester United hiring ‘elite’ manager,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.However, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”.  It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”.  It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedTaoiseach unveils bust of John Hume in WashingtonNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in Irish‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeNI human rights commitments needed in UK trade deal, Amnesty tells US governmentLatestMarvel stands with LGBT community following passing of controversial US billFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedRalf Rangnick says referee made it easy for Atletico to do ‘time-wasting antics’Kylie Jenner says postpartum after birth of son was ‘not easy mentally’Paul Scholes stresses the importance of Manchester United hiring ‘elite’ manager,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our direct competitors in the Republic of Ireland are dealing with such signicant applications much more efficiently. This is a major consideration for companies deciding where to invest.”Alliance MLA Andrew Muir said the delays point to a “systemic problem” at the heart of DfI, which “ought to be leading as a role model in planning matters, but instead is more like a black hole where key planning applications disappear for determination to be delayed for years”.“Nothing less than radical reform is needed to ensure the voices of communities are better heard and applications not left sitting stuck in the system without a decision to reject or approve,” he added.DfI said: “The department is working closely with key stakeholders in a number of ways to improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system to ensure that planning applications are processed in a timely manner. “A review of the implementation of the Planning Act has been completed. In addition, the department, as part of a collaborative project with  councils, will be delivering a new planning IT system next year which will improve the submission and processing of planning applications.“A planning engagement partnership has also been established to look at how to enhance the quality and depth of community engagement in the planning process at both the regional and local planning levels.“It is hoped that the collective improvements delivered from this work will improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system across the board.”Related topicsAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureNichola MallonMore On Andrew MuirAlliance MLAs believe recorded vote was required for key climate bill amendmentMost NI schools have not had to move to remote learning despite Covid-related absences, says Education Minister PremiumBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year low PremiumViewpointOpinionSkimping on road repairs must stopDUP is slammed over £m of extra funding now ‘in limbo’Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedKilroot power station seeking to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noTaoiseach unveils bust of John Hume in WashingtonNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in Irish‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeLatestGwen Stefani to headline festivities at Hollywood Bowl th anniversaryBillie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo to perform at th Grammy awardsMarvel stands with LGBT community following passing of controversial US billFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedRalf Rangnick says referee made it easy for Atletico to do ‘time-wasting antics’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneySam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe new head of the Civil Service has declined to say whether it is acceptable for a Stormont department to attempt to overturn a judicial finding that a civil servant was driven from her job after she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering.Last week the Belfastrevealed the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswas using taxpayers’ money to attempt to overturn a devastating judgment that raised serious concerns about Northern Ireland’s chief vet and one of his deputies.Six months ago an employment tribunal unanimously found that Tamara Bronckaers, a senior DAERA vet with an “exemplary performance and record”, had been constructively sacked because she blew the whistle.The case has major implications for the treatment of Civil Service whistleblowers, the welfare of animals, the spread of disease, and the reputation of the cattle traceability system which, since the BSE crisis, has been central to how the agriculture industry has marketed local beef.The public could be forced to pay £m to compensate her, along with huge legal bills.In a ,-word judgment, Employment Judge Ó Murray repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues — line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey.At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to pursue enforcement action against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals, and animal movements being electronically deleted.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Huey told her he knew the manager of the market personally and also its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey. Both men remain in post, while Dr Bronckaers does not. The Belfastasked Dr Bradyas head of the Civil Service she had anything to say about whether, on her watch, this will be acceptable, and whether she has any message to other whistleblowers.In response the Executive Office, within which the head of the Civil Service sits, responded: “It is not appropriate to comment on an ongoing legal issue which is a matter for DAERA.”Dr Brady, who was brought in from Belfast City Council, was appointed last year.Three months ago she told an Assembly committee that one of her key priorities was to deliver the recommendations of the RHI Inquiry, and said “of course we’re all aware of the whistleblowing legislation”.There was no suggestion that Dr Bronckaers was anything other than genuine, and the Civil Service handbook makes clear that whistleblowers should be encouraged.It states that the organisation “encourages staff to raise issues of concern internally to provide an opportunity to have such matters investigated and addressed as appropriate. Reasonable belief that wrongdoing has taken place is sufficient justication… It will always be assumed that concerns have been raised in good faith unless there is evidence to the contrary”.It adds that officials “should not suffer any detriment or harassment as a result.”If DAERA loses its appeal, taxpayers will fund Dr Bronckaers’ compensation, which could be as much as £m, plus hefty legal bills.Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - The Executive OfficeMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyIntegrated Education Bill is shameful, claims DUP’s Edwin Poots PremiumMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ body PremiumUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeUUP’s Beattie urges NI households to take part in Ukrainian refugee scheme launched on Monday PremiumSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeLatestBillie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo to perform at th Grammy awardsMarvel stands with LGBT community following passing of controversial US billFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedRalf Rangnick says referee made it easy for Atletico to do ‘time-wasting antics’Kylie Jenner says postpartum after birth of son was ‘not easy mentally’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the Economy‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfall PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeLatestGwen Stefani to headline festivities at Hollywood Bowl th anniversaryBillie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo to perform at th Grammy awardsMarvel stands with LGBT community following passing of controversial US billFive men arrested in Lyra McKee murder probe releasedRalf Rangnick says referee made it easy for Atletico to do ‘time-wasting antics’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough. He steadied himself and began to address his companions.lsquoHe lted one hand and pointed ahead. He named the parts. He spoke of horses and ploughing points. He strained and balanced and explained. Against the grey stone wall of the old gaol yard he conjured up the green fields of another le.lsquoOne of the nurses who came with the visiting party said to me: ldquoDo you know, thatrsquos the first time he has spoken for three years.rsquoThese words opened a chapter in the book Down on the Farm, published by Down County Museum in .They were specially chosen to help us understand that museum collections and activities are not just static objects or exercises in nostalgia. While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone. Imagine ourselves into that dferent world from which we have come. Think not only of the making of carts and the breeding and care of horses but also of the recycling of enormous amounts of dung.Museum staff managed to locate three of the last of these lsquotrottlersquo or lsquotrucklersquo cars and preserve the evidence of their construction. As with all aspects of museum work, this required both local and specialist knowledge, active travelling around the area and respectful relationships with the community.The museum developed a unique relationship with the community that was based on valuing and understanding the importance of lsquopeople and placersquo. The generous support of the community has been instrumental in creating the award-winning treasure-house that is the Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Family Autism Group fundraising to help get new home  ","story":"A FUNDRAISING drive towards establishing a new base has been launched by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.The group aims to raise pound, over the next year to create a centre in the town for its dedicated use.The supports  families with at least one child which has autism.Project co-ordinator Aine Sloan explained that parents believe the centre is needed for the development of their children and the group in general.ldquoWe want to make a practical dference to the children and young people and their families by providing a strong support network, she said.ldquoOur activities and events are a good way for families to get to talk to one another and realise they are not alone.ldquoIt is very important to have the opportunity to meet others who understand the daily challenges and struggles they face as a family. We want to remove the isolation felt by both autistic children and their families.The group proved a leline to parents and children when it continued to provide activities and support to them over the lockdowns.It organises a range of activities and courses such as monthly parent support groups specialised autism parent training, fun days out, summer scheme, music and occupational therapy and sibling events.It was founded in  over a cup of coffee by two parents who were felt there was no support for their families before and after a diagnosis of autism.Aine explained: ldquoThis initially started as a monthly cup of coffee and a chat but quickly blossomed into something bigger due to sheer determination of our parents to make a dference.ldquoDAFSG is managed by a small committee who are all parents of autistic children which now includes new as well as founding members. We offer support to over  local families with membership increasing weekly due to the demand for our support.ldquoWe know it will take more than pound, to establish the centre and to run it but we need to show our commitment to other potential capital funders that we can fundraise and support our activities.Aine said that the group managed so far by renting rooms in ious local centres, but it was not a option it wanted in the long term.ldquoThis is not ideal and provides no continuity for our families.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option. However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School site at nearby Shanslieve Drive but lost out in a bidding war to supermarket giant Lidl.Local politicians say they are keen to see progress on the new leisure complex and are pleased that it will now include an indoor pool as residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Jack to embark on sky jump in memory of aunt  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man will jump out of a plane from , feet to raise money for a childrenrsquos cancer charity.Jack Welshhas decided to take the plunge in memory of his aunt Joanne, who sadly passed away in .Going one step further in his fundraising efforts, the full-time barber is also opting to completely shave his head in a bid to raise even more money for his chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children.ldquoI have been wanting to do something like this for a while so I thought I would just go for it, said Jack.ldquoMy aunty is the main inspiration behind the jump and I feel like the chosen charity is definitely a worthwhile one.ldquoMy family couldnrsquot be any more supportive, they are behind me all the way so that helps spur me on as the big day approaches.Jack will take to the skies on Saturday, March , and will also shave his head on the same day.

We are interested in solutions and putting people first and the Fishing and Seafood Development programme is one solution we must deliver on.ldquoI hope voters will remember issues such as this in May as they will be the people who elect a new Executive.Cllr Curran said the fishing and fish processing industries were an essential part of le in Ardglass and the local economy.ldquoThese industries must be protected and enhanced and this is all achievable, he declared.ldquoIt is welcome news that approval has been given for the programmersquos strategic outline case which allows DAERA to procure consultants to take forward detailed environmental and technical studies.ldquoHowever, this approval only allows DAERA to incur expenditure on work required to inform the later outline business cases upon which any later decisions to proceed with infrastructure development, such as the deepening of Ardglass harbour will be based.Cllr Curran said he hoped that the absence of the NI Executive and the uncertainty of its future does not obstruct the progress of the ldquovital fishing programme which offers so much potential for Ardglass and other local ports..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Regional rates frozen for business owners  ","story":"BUSINESSES and ratepayers have received some good news with confirmation that the regional rate has been frozen for another year.The decision by Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy is part of a poundm province-wide rates support package for the new financial year.He has also confirmed that the small business rate relief scheme benefiting thousands of business premises will also continue, explaining the message from businesses is that the rates holiday was a vital leline for them during the pandemic.The finance minister said the poundm rates support package to support the recovery will provide all businesses with a one month rates holiday with the exception of utilities and larger food stores while retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports will receive a three months rates holiday.Mr Murphy said businesses in the hardest hit sectors had paid no rates since March  and will now pay no rates until July.He said freezing the regional rate is intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike, with the extension of the small business rate relief scheme resulting in businesses automatically receiving a reduction of between % and % on their rates.The finance minister added: ldquoSmall businesses are at the core of our local economy and have a vital role in contributing to employment opportunities.ldquoI am glad to announce the continuation of the small business rate relief scheme which currently supports almost , business premises. The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

It feels like we are going in the opposite direction..removeThe Reds bow out of the #UCL#MUFC— Manchester UnitedMarch , “The next man might not be the right man, but the people behind the scenes have to make sure he is the right man.“Maybe they need a manager that they are going to be afraid of and that will scare them into performances.”Interim manager Ralf Rangnick is set to move into a consultancy role at the end of the season, having been appointed to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the dugout while a permanent successor is found.Scholes, though, is not convinced by the German’s current position.“I don’t want to keep having a go at Ralf Rangnick, he seems really nice and comes across well in interviews, he’s very honest, but, how he was chosen to be manager of this club for six months until the end of the season, I’ll never know,” Scholes said.“The coach is a massive part of it. This isn’t a terrible group of players. I thinkyou give this group of players a structure and way of playing, there’s some real talent in the squad.”Scholes added: “The very first thing this club needs to do, to get anywhere near winning the league again, is get a proper coach.“Get a coach that suits the players, give them two or three years to build a squad of players that will challenge.”Former United defender Rio Ferdinand cannot see a positive ending to the current campaign.“For Man United, the season to me seems over – what is there to really achieve ” Ferdinand said on BT Sport.⏰ RESULT ⏰🔴⚪️ Atlético progress - on aggregate thanks to Renan Lodis first-half header…🔝 Who impressed at Old Trafford #UCL— UEFA Champions LeagueMarch , “ are floundering behind Arsenalthey win their games in hand.“Tonight was really a reflection of what the season has been like – there have been moments where they have been good, but far too often it is Jekyll and Hyde performances.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBut overall there is a lack of evidence about the best methods of ensuring pupils attend school.The review of findings from  studies, carried out by the Education Endowment Fund , of how to improve pupil attendance explored eight dferent methods.It looked at mentoring, communication with parents, meal provision, extracurricular activities, punishments or rewards, behaviour interventions, targeted approaches and teaching social and emotional skills, as well as other interventions that did not fit into these categories.One intervention which sent parents “nudge” letters to improve attendance, focusing on the number of schooldays their children had missed the previous year, was found to have had a positive impact on boosting pupils’ attendance in school.The letter focused on the importance of pupils’ attendance for their learning and the wider school community. It was also translated into the most commonly spoken languages of families in the area.Another positive impact involved providing intervention and support from social workers for pupils with persistent absenteeism, such as providing an older “walking buddy” to accompany them to schoollack of transport was an issue.The paper noted that all but three of the studies took place in the United States, and they were all carried out before the pandemic.It concluded there was a lack of clear evidence about what works in reducing absenteeism, with both the EEF and Youth Endowment Fund using their new funding round to develop evidence on effective methods for raising attendance.The paper noted that attendance is a growing issue – in  , poor attendance was reported as .% overall, with special schools having a higher rate equal to .% and persistent absence at .% in England.Professor Becky Francis, chief executive of the EEF, said: “We know that pupils who are persistently absent from school are less like to achieve well academically..remove“But as today’s new evidence review shows, we know much less about the best ways to improve attendance.“While the research finds some positive impacts for approaches like engaging with parents and addressing the inidual needs of pupils, overall, the evidence on what works for reducing absenteeism is weak.“Teachers deserve a much clearer picture of how best to support their pupils who are persistently absent. Our new funding round with the Youth Endowment Fund will help fill some of these evidence gaps, by identying and evaluating promising interventions, programmes, and approaches.”Jon Yates, chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund , said: “Being away from school not only limits a child’s ability to succeed academically, but also puts them at risk of criminal exploitation or trapped in dangerous home environments.”“Absences from school means that children can’t receive the support they might need from their teachers or pastoral staff, which could help to keep them from harm. Simply put, to keep children safe, we need to know how best to keep them in school.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that the “pupils most likely to be absent from school are often those who are vulnerable and struggle the most in education”.He added that improving these pupils’ attendance was “vital to improving their outcomes and le chances”. While schools worked hard to do this already, the EEF findings showed they lacked firm evidence about which approaches worked.“However, this issue is not only about the approaches that are used, it is also about the resources that are available,” he said.“Over the past decade, central government has decimated the funding for local authority education support services, reducing the capacity of these services to support pupils and parents and to tackle persistent absence. At the same time, it has squeezed school funding, making it harder for schools to provide pastoral support for pupils who are facing challenges and barriers.“The Government is currently placing a big focus on improving attendance, particularly in the wake of the Covid pandemic, and it is right to do so. But it must recognise that effective and sustainable intervention on a national scale requires an appropriate level of investment.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sending parents  unudge u letters can boost attendance  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe British Pregnancy Advisory Servicesaid it opposed National Institute of Health and Care Excellenceproposals that any alcohol consumption reported by a pregnant woman should be automatically transferred to her child’s medical record.The plans, part of Nice’s Quality Standard on the diagnosis and assessment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder , prompted a backlash.Campaigners said the plans would have infringed on a woman’s right to privacy and denied pregnant women the ability to have a frank and confidential conversation with her midwe about alcohol.Nice has now published its latest document on how health and care services can improve the diagnosis, assessment and prevention of FASD.The standard states that pregnant women are asked about their alcohol use throughout their pregnancy and this is recorded, but it does not suggest that this should automatically be transferred to the child’s health record.Nice also said pregnant women should be given advice throughout pregnancy not to drink alcohol.Commenting on the document, BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy said: “We welcome the decision by Nice to drop proposals to automatically transfer any alcohol consumption reported by a pregnant woman to her child’s medical records.“It is absolutely staggering that these measures, which had no basis in evidence and would have amounted to an extraordinary infringement on women’s right to privacy, were ever suggested by Nice in the first place.“The vast majority of women do not consume alcohol once pregnancy is confirmed or consume at levels not associated with harm.“While we are pleased to see that the recommendation regarding the transferal of data from a woman’s medical records on to those of her child has been dropped, we remain concerned about the routine questioning of women throughout pregnancy on this issue..remove“Our research shows women find antenatal discussions about alcohol – even when they don’t drink at all – can supersede other issues important to them, like their own mental health and wellbeing.“Those supporting pregnant women must be able to provide care that meets the needs of the inidual before them, not just to fill in boxes on a checklist.”Dr Paul Chrisp, director of Nice’s centre for guidelines, said: “We know children and young people with FASD often have a poorer quality of le and must overcome some incredibly dficult challenges in their daily lives.“This quality standard aims to improve the diagnosis and care offered to children and young people with FASD as well as ensuring that women are given consistent advice about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy.“FASD is a series of preventable mental and physical birth defects associated with alcohol use during pregnancy. Helping women to drink less or no alcohol during their pregnancy will reduce the number of children and young people affected by FASD.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Plans to record mothers u drinking habits on baby health records scrapped article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
