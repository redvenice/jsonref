Switzerland and Germany have been ided by the coronavirus pandemic. Fences, concrete obstacles or barrier tapes separate them after the borders were closed to slow the spread of the virus. But love cannot be locked away“Look, we even marked the border on our blanket,” laughs Sabrina. And indeed just below the barrier tape a black line ides the cloth in half. Lying on one half is Sabrina, from Basel on the other, Davor from Wiesbaden. We are in Riehen, the rich suburban community of Basel.It is the first time that the two of them have seen each other since the border was closed a good six weeks ago. The Covid-19 pandemic caused Switzerland and its surrounding countries to close their borders mid-March. Only people who work in another country and companies transporting goods are now allowed to cross the borders at the few crossings that are still open.It is a warm spring day. Riehen is famous for its cherry trees, thanks to the mild climate of the Rhine plain. And on these cherry trees, which are in blossom on both sides, the border guards have attached barrier tapes which now mark what is accessible. These tapes also trace the border lines which were reinforced with barbed wire during the second world war.For the people on both sides, these restrictions are a serious disturbance, as the border has hardly been noticed in recent decades. Friendships exist across borders, as do families and lovers.“Take pictures of us,” says Sabrina. “It’s good if this becomes known.” An untenable situation for her. Davor arrived today to see his girlfriend. It takes three and a half hours to drive from Wiesbaden, and he will return in the evening.Despite everything, the mood is good on this friendly day. Along the barrier tape several groups of people have arranged to meet: separated families, friends, other lovers. A group of young men has set up camping chairs on both sides of the barrier. All three are from Lörrach in Germany, the neighbouring community of Riehen. One of them is studying in Basel. This is the only place they can meet and drink beer together.The border stretches up the hill. A bit further up the edge of the forest, I meet Diethard (on the German side) and his girlfriend Sibel (on the Swiss side). Sibel, also a German citizen, works in a clinic in Switzerland: “If I were to officially go over to Germany, I would first have to be in quarantine for two weeks. That’s impossible.”Now and then an army helicopter flies along the unclear border, making sure the rules are obeyed on the ground. There soldiers reinforce the border guards. If a couple gets too close to each other on the border, the guards usually turn a blind eye.This is not the case everywhere. Further east on Lake Constance are Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) and its sister city of Constance (Germany). They have grown together completely. In some places, the fence erected by the Swiss during the second world war to prevent Jewish refugees or German opposition members from crossing the border still exists.Since the border is shorter and clearer here than at Basel, it was easier to close it again in the wake of the pandemic.Shortly after the closing of the border, I meet Katarina from Frauenfeld, in Switzerland, and Ivo, a student from Konstanz. Three times a week they meet at the border, also to exchange tenderness they met in Croatia only last New Year.Here, physical closeness was a thorn in the side of the Swiss law enforcement officers: a week later, when I saw the two of them again, kissing was no longer possible. A second fence was raised two metres away from the first, under strong protest from the local population. Now Katarina and Ivo can only look into each other’s eyes.But they still have it good: along the Italian and French borders, such meetings were always out of the question, because in Italy and France – unlike in Switzerland and Germany – strict curfews prevented this.With the flattening of the corona curve, demands are now being made to open the borders again. Not only families and couples want their normal relationship back, but also the trades that usually do good business on the other side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b65c9de0703d788c1f220a6704d600e5be628b8/0_30_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242820321209cfb2506c14dc87bb02a4","title":"buy a classic sport photograph euphoria at the 1966 world cup","story":"The latest of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images.

Can they stop people switching over to Netflix?This week, the most social, crowded, people-watching-oriented event of the global visual art calendar – Frieze art fair, in its New York iteration – is happening on devices everywhere. It has transformed itself into an online shop with art as the scrollable produce. The Asos effect is amplified by the fact that prices, for once, are displayed for all to see. A Martin Creed neon spelling out the words DON’T WORRY could be yours for $150,000 (£118,000).The reopening of art institutions still seems a distant prospect for many parts of the world – and the idea of the hyper-crowded blockbuster show even more so. So has the moment for digital art arrived? Artists – many of them locked out of studios and with projects, residencies and exhibitions having evaporated – are improvising with the means at their disposal. At least those, of course, who aren’t sick, or caring for others, or running up face masks on their sewing machines (like Stephanie Syjuco, the California-based artist, who has been producing around 100 a week for use by frontline community workers). Many are getting used to working in new ways, some of them digital. But this is what artists have always done. As Martin Clark, director of Camden Arts Centre in London, says: “I used to work at Tate St Ives. There it’s really noticeable that when you get to the war years, paintings became really small – because there wasn’t much canvas around. Everyone’s work changed to accommodate the material conditions. In a way, what’s happening now is no different.” (For his own institution, accommodating the conditions has meant launching an online version of a now delayed exhibition, The Botanical Mind – a site rich with texts, recordings and images, plus a new digital work by Adam Chodzko.)Some forms of digital experimentation are survival strategies. East Sussex-based painter Matthew Burrows began #artistsupportpledge on Instagram to help artists financially, given that many fragile livelihoods have been destroyed by loss of projects, residencies and second jobs. Artists post work to sell for no more than £200. Whenever they make £1,000, they pledge to spend £200 on another artist’s work – and so on. It has raised an estimated £20m for artists and makers worldwide.Supporting artists financially was also part of the idea behind Transmissions, organised by artists Tai Shani, Anne Duffau and Hana Noorali, under the auspices of Somerset House in London. Every Thursday evening at 9pm until the end of May, artists invited by the trio are putting on a kind of TV show. (Episodes are not archived – be there on Twitch or catch the Friday morning repeat.) Episode one, put together by Shani, Duffau and Noorali, started with a magical journey through the cosmos to meet a beneficent goddess episode two, by Sophie Jung, had anarchic echoes of old-fashioned Saturday-night light entertainment, Basil Brush and all. Putting art out online in this way, says Shani, is using the internet “more as a carrier or vessel for work than a conceptual point”. Like many artists, Dubai-based Lawrence Abu Hamdan (along with Shani, one of the artists who won the 2019 Turner prize) posted most of his film-based works to YouTube during lockdown, though there are significant losses when works made for a gallery sit on the flat, unforgiving rectangle of a digital screen – not least that the viewer may be tempted to switch to Netflix at any second. “The first few minutes of Once Removed are deliberately almost boring,” he says, referring to a recent work about a young Druze man who understands himself to be the reincarnation of a relative who died in the Lebanese civil war. “That doesn’t work so well online.” (It is very much worth sticking with.)Goshka Macuga – whose intellectually dense work is usually based on lengthy periods of intense research – began a lockdown Instagram account, @Grekaandfriends, in which an animated version of her dog offers satirical thoughts on life, the pandemic and everything. “I went into it with the aim of entertaining people, sharing, doing something that existed outside the art market,” she says. “I think of it in the tradition of the political cartoon.” She records the sound in her loo, which has the best acoustic for the purpose, and has used a simple animation app. “It was easy, and has given me a way of having an instant voice. We don’t know what the art world will be like in the future. An economic crisis on a large scale will, of course, impact it. We may have to change the way we work. It has been a good exercise in making something that literally takes no money to produce.”Another project born from confinement is a short film by Madalina Zaharia, which will be part of Viral Portraits, an online exhibition, from 15 May, at Moderna Galerija, in Ljubljana (which has just reopened after the easing of Slovenia’s lockdown). After she was grounded in London with her partner, fellow artist Ross Taylor, the couple decided the time had come – at last – to clean their small basement flat. But, she decided, not before “documenting the mess”. Fortunately, she was in temporary possession of a film camera that could not be returned to its owner owing to lockdown, and so she got to work. The Mess Can’t Clean the Hand is a creepy, noirish little film that seems to encapsulate the domestic anxiety around clutter and mess. The hand itself is an agent of chaos – perhaps even contagion – rather than Marie Kondo-like order. (The flat remains untidied at the time of writing.)Ben Vickers, the chief technology officer at London’s Serpentine Gallery, is soon, along with colleagues, to publish a report completed before the pandemic, titled Future Art Ecosystems. One of the open – and unanswered – questions posed by the document is: “What would a major public art institution look like without physical exhibition or performance spaces?” That seems a particularly resonant line of inquiry right now. But it’s also clear that digital art has a long and complex history. What used to be called “net art” can trace its roots back to an era before the web – to the 1960s mail art movement, for example, when artists sent work by post. Organisations including New York-based Rhizome have been supporting and preserving art made to be seen online for years. Some organisations better known for their physical exhibitions, such as Dia Art Foundation, have long been working with digital art, and now may be the time to discover some of these older web-based commissions, which date to 1995. (Dia director Jessica Morgan reports an uptick of interest in these, as her audience’s attention erts to Dia’s website.) It’s too early to tell what impact the pandemic may have, says Vickers. One thing, though, that he’s spotted on a personal level, is the appeal of virtual reality at a time when much of his life, professional and social, has been conducted through the aching flatness of Zoom. He has been “meeting” with the artist Jakob Kudsk Steensen – who last year made an augmented-reality tour of Kensington Gardens called The Deep Listener for the Serpentine – in a VR environment. “I’d given up on VR a year or so ago, but the greater sense of presence you get is a relief now there’s only the flat screen. Curators are starting to think about how you could host a public event with VR, how you could really deploy it well.”Meanwhile, Glasgow International – the biennial festival that should have taken place in late April, but has now been delayed until 2021 – launched a small, well-judged digital programme that will stay online through May. It combines old, new and swiftly reworked art by some of those commissioned to show in the physical lineup. It begins with a simple audio work, Yesterday, by Georgina Starr, a recording of her whistling the Beatles song, that she made in the empty corridors of the Slade School of Art when she was a student in 1991. Heard now, the solitary voice echoing from a deserted space seems appropriately melancholic.Alberta Whittle, meanwhile, quickly reworked the film she had been making – about the Forth and Clyde canal as a metaphor for the migration of people over waterways. Now it speaks directly to the moment, drawing together the threads of the Home Office’s “hostile environment”, the Windrush scandal, and the role of immigrants as frontline NHS workers. According to Richard Parry, the festival director, some aficionados of this well-loved festival gathered together on Zoom for an unofficial opening party, with drinks and group viewing of the online works: a sense of community despite the odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68907e553be4e02cca96461240e8eb7babcee45e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24f062db2b227cfcd7d5d0d10336031","title":"life on the road during coronavirus lockdown photo essay","story":"Photojournalist Sean Smith travels with long-haul drivers delivering essential goods during the UK lockdownby  Lisa O\u0027Carroll photographs by  Sean SmithFresh breezes carry the scent of spring meadows across the empty motorways as thousands of truckers keep the nation stocked with food and medical supplies.Long-haul drivers’ journeys have been cut by up to three hours and they have received heartwarming expressions of appreciation from people clapping them on their way from motorway bridges.But there is also hardship for those not in the essential goods business, and some surprising letdowns including closures of toilets and exceptional reckless driving to contend with. One car driver was recorded at 134mph in a 40mph zone in London, while Gloucestershire police clocked a driver at 122mph on the M5.But lockdown also brings out the best in people, says Bill Dommett, 62, a driver with C\u0026ampD South West, based in Chard, Somerset, during a trip with the  onboard.“You see kids, adults, elderly people waving and clapping and they have little placards. You give a hoot or a smile and you can see they are so happy. I don’t look at myself as anyone special, I’m just a lorry driver, so seeing people appreciate what you are doing although you’ve never been appreciated like that before is really nice. It’s heartwarming and brings a tear to your eye a bit,” says Dommett.He tells of another incident in the past week when he bought 15 bars of a new variety of Galaxy chocolate for his prison-officer daughter, who says it kept her going after he brought a bar home for her one night.“The cashier came round and picked up another five bars and handed them to me, saying, ‘That’s from one key worker to another, stay safe and well and hopefully see you next week,’” said Dommett. “It’s just really made me stop. What a gesture.”Mark Bagley, 45, is a night driver, cabbing a double-decker 60ft truck for the same firm. His usual route is the 340-mile return journey from Chard to a Palletforce distribution centre in Burton upon Trent, where he can drop off or pick up vital supplies ranging from bread, flour and fruit to industrial supplies.Each way takes about three and a half hours, depending on accidents, bottlenecks and congestion.Covid-19 has emptied the roads, reminding Bagley of the big open countryside of the US where the only other vehicles are the tractors and combines slowly moving through the crops.“Before coronavirus, you’d see about 300 vehicles an hour. Now it’s a completely different world. I’ve driven in the States quite a lot and it’s very similar countryside. I thought you’d never see that in this country but when coronavirus hit it was like I was driving in Wisconsin again,” says Bagley.It is not just business trips and family car journeys that have vanished, but also truck carrying non-essential goods.“It’s been very spooky,” says Dommett. “If you go to a service station now, there are two or three cars in the car park, no caravans, no coaches.”But there are upsides too, he says. “It’s so nice to be able to get into your lorry and set the cruising speed at 53 to 56mph and just stay there without having cars in front doing 50mph forcing you to use the gears.” Like everywhere, there are those flouting the lockdown rules, and Bagley says he has been shocked on one or two occasions.“The other day I had two bikers on Harley-Davidsons on either side of me – that’s the middle lane doing 80mph and his friend doing the same on the inside of me on the hard shoulder. This is in broad daylight. There was a car in front of me and a truck in front of the car and next thing the bike on the inside swerves in between the car and the truck. I thought: I hope he falls off his bike and breaks his neck. It made me really angry. “You’ve got a five-year-old girl dying of Covid and you have these 3435-year-old men messing around with people’s lives on the motorway. It was just depressing to see, especially as you have the electronic matrixes every gantry and bridge saying “Stay home, essential travel only, save lives”. It’s constant, there are no excuses. You don’t drive on the hard shoulder anyway, even at 80mph,” says Bagley.As expected, she has seen larger volumes in collections and deliveries to supermarkets, including Morrisons’ regional distribution centre in Bridgwater, Somerset, as well as garden furniture and patio tiles. But there have also been some surprises including an increase in orders for hot tubs and pools.Small breweries have stopped deliveries, while business for a client who supplies wood-burning stoves has plummeted, as fitting the furnaces would involve workers entering a home for non-essential work, which is advised against.Dommett having a lunch break on the road.C\u0026ampD South West also did a twice-weekly run to central London with hotel minibar stocks including water bottles, snack packets and chocolate. The supplier is still trading but the hotel business evaporated overnight.The decline in custom has also hit drivers. Food is no longer available at service stations, which have also closed toilets and showers.“I think it’s disgusting,” says Dommett. “We are out on the road the whole time keeping supplies moving, where are you supposed to wash your hands?” he said, underlining the risk that creates of spreading the virus between different locations.One day Dommett might be in Wolverhampton, another in Middlesbrough or nearer home, picking up or dropping off farm feed. He remembers the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, when everything and everyone entering a farm was disinfected, and cannot believe the cavalier attitude of some when it comes to hygiene and coronavirus.He thinks some depots might have used Covid-19 as an excuse to close toilets they did not want to provide for drivers in the first place.A spokesman for the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said: “It goes against health and safety as essentially a lorry driver is at work and should have access to toilets where they collect or deposit loads. We had loads and loads of complaints at the beginning and still get one or two a day. We got on to the Department for Transport and phoned the various depots too.”Hammond says she tries to keep up morale, giving drivers laminated drawings of rainbows for their windscreens and baking a seven-layer coloured cake for her workers.While her business is going OK and might be big enough to survive, she fears for the smaller family-run businesses.Paul Mummery, an RHA spokesman, says: “There are a lot of truckers out there who just want to get back to work, even if they are furloughed and that might seem like it’s OK. There’s an anxiety that volumes of trade won’t return and this is a precarious industry anyway.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a608a2b53ff6b52170a0ca092bbaed84d738b62/0_234_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa4e8af3ccc01b7b854e8b7052d65a17","title":"readers favourite coronavirus street art laugh uk lockdown houses roads shops","story":"Houses, roads and shops all over the UK have been redecorated and reinvigorated during lockdownSeeing this makes me feel proud of what we have in the UK.

They are working seriously hard in difficult circumstances to make our lives the best they can be.It also makes me proud of the people in my borough. They are pulling together, using their skills and doing their bit to check on each other and help out in these strange times. Whether it’s amazing artwork like this, online quizzes, DJ sets, online advice for business, craft making or calling up lonely people for a chat, they are all pulling their weight through tough times.This piece of work stands out and really brightens up the street. I witnessed the artist finishing the piece and people who were out on their daily walk were saying how great it was. It’s a conversation piece and makes people smile when they walk past. Jimmy Lee, DagenhamIn these difficult times street art is a great way to connect and express the way we are feeling. Vic Brown, TamworthThis curious glittery sign appeared on the street overnight and made me stop, smile and take a photo. I was pleased to see that there’s no shortage of creativity despite everything else that’s going on. Ben Park, Ealing in LondonThis made me happy. It was great to see something someone has made just to share and spread cheer. Simon Doughty, DesboroughMy partner works in our local hospital and it made her day when our next door neighbour painted her back wall in a such a glittery fashion. Ashley Woodfall, BoscombeMy wife Mel is an artist. She took the side of our house as a canvas. This is her with our daughter. She’s now encouraged all her friends to stop by when they are on their allotted exercise, take a photo and send it to her. She is then going to create a collage of the photos. Seeing this makes me feel proud. Kevin Chappell, Wirral.Seeing the message to care workers filled me with both happiness and sadness. Happiness to know that someone has created this to acknowledge and thank those who strive everyday to care for our loved ones. Sadness that these amazing people have for so long been overlooked and undervalued. Tracy Wilson, South Norwood in LondonA few weeks ago the council painted social distancing markers on the promenade. They were a bit utilitarian. A few days later someone gave the little people faces and personalities. When I first saw them, they made me laugh. I look forward to seeing them every day on my daily walk. Jacquie, Worthing.Every time I walk past this house it makes me smile as they have obviously put a lot of effort into sending a message of support to our NHS. As I was taking a photo this morning, one of the housemates was leaving and chatted about ordering the chalks from Amazon and spreading a little joy in the world. Great stuff. Peter Spark, OxfordI walk past this while taking my daughter to school. It had been vandalised for years until our local community group commissioned a local artist to create a design as a tribute to our key workers. I find it uplifting and love the fact that it’s something the whole community can appreciate. Angie Talbot, LeedsThese sign paintings have been accumulating over the past months. They have become a landmark in our area. The route is a main road between two major hospitals so ambulances pass by regularly.I like it because it is representing something we all want to say. With all the museums closed, it feels like art has found a way to come out into public space and remind us all why we need it here – and more than ever at this time. Asif Khan, Hackney in LondonI saw this on the front of a closed down takeaway restaurant. I love the bright colours and the sentiment. Annie Willetts, Sydenham in LondonI took this on the last weekend before lockdown in Manchester. I have not been in the city centre since, sticking to my local area. It makes me sad for all the amazing small businesses in this city, but hopeful that they will survive and be thriving again soon. Elizabeth Relins, ManchesterI run on the cycle path a couple of times most weeks. There is a long hoarding separating the path from a brownfield building site and it is constantly changing and evolving with artwork, ranging from some pretty crappy tags to some terrific pieces. This comes somewhere in the middle. I love how it has taken the Corona logo and made it into something more menacing and timely. I also like the “please wash your hands” strap along the top. I don’t know how long it will last, but it’s there for now. Kate Matheson, BristolWe saw this piece of street art just before the lockdown measures were put in place. It is a striking and skilful design. When we saw the work it seemed very prescient. At the time people were stockpiling toilet paper and the art work satirically incorporates a loo roll instead of a dot on the “i” in “virus”. While humorous, the work was an ominous indication of the effect the virus was going to have in the weeks to come. Michael Mulvihill, GatesheadHackney Wick is alive with street art. Every day you turn a corner and something new grabs your eye. This piece appeared early on in the crisis. To me it captures the public’s mood to the Covid-19 crisis – NHS, masks, loo roll, don’t panic. Jacqueline Bruce, Bow in LondonOur pedestrian tunnel had been a tagging magnet for a long time. The interior was greatly helped a few years ago when someone painted inidual bricks in a myriad of different shades, making the wonderful rainbow that appeared overnight on 8 April all the more perfect. Our local social media has been abuzz with how uplifting it is and how emotional people feel travelling through it. We’re all hoping it will be preserved post lockdown. Helen Wade, HoveI know my friends are missing being at school and that the teachers are missing us too, so I wanted to use my art as a voice to acknowledge that. The crossing at my school, Comberton Village College in Cambridge, felt like the perfect place to make an artwork.

Today the British Library is calling on the nation’s children to follow in their footsteps and write their own small books, which will form part of an online “National Library of Miniature Books for the toy world”.Inspired by the library’s collection of “miniature gems”, which ranges from the 600 miniature volumes in Queen Mary’s dolls’ house to publisher John Marshall’s matchbox-sized Infant’s Library, the project is backed by authors and illustrators including Axel Scheffler and Jacqueline Wilson, each of whom has created their own book for the library.In a series of videos of the authors reading their miniature books, Wilson shares hers about a rabbit called Radish that lives on her desk, while Scheffler’s tells a squirrel called Fipsy who is adjusting to life in lockdown. The Gruffalo illustator also reveals that he often makes tiny dummy books when working, showing a miniature edition of The Snail and the Whale as well as a tiny copy of The Gruffalo he made for his daughter’s dolls’ house.Other contributors to the British Library’s new project include Katherine Rundell and Philip Ardagh. The latter’s book, about a boy called Tim Little who has very little time to get to the library, includes a stamped British Library “Miniature Book Loans” form in the front cover.“They’ve all told me they loved making the books,” said the library’s Anna Lobbenberg.She said that the tiny books created by the Brontës “provided a kind of literary workshop for the children, allowing them to experiment with different genres and styles and thus to evolve their own extraordinary writing style”, while the “playful approach to scale” of Marshall’s miniature books from 1800 “allowed his young readers to expand into responsible, wise teachers”, taking charge by explaining the world to their toys.“Being able to hold and manipulate tiny versions of ordinary objects is both powerful and delightful for children, helping them to take on new responsibilities and personas,” she said, adding that the library hoped the project would help young readers gain confidence by playing the part of authors, illustrators, bookbinders and librarians.The library is conscious that during lockdown “a high proportion of children do not have access to computers, and that many do not have art materials”, so it will also be distributing a printed pack through public libraries, food banks and sheltered accommodation, and emailing PDFs to teachers nationwide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78bc19ab85d06f90f5debf53c7625d1356b8146/0_434_4376_2626/master/4376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c426e4a7db6c56e69e5dc7440e297c2b","title":"uk delivery drivers how have you been affected by coronavirus","story":"If you work as a food or goods delivery courier or a taxi driver in the UK, we’d like to hear about your experiencesWhether you deliver packages for online retailers, drop off supermarket home deliveries, or drive people from A to B, we’d like to hear how your work has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.How have things changed since lockdown started?

Tables in restaurants, which will operate at a “significantly” reduced capacity with longer hours to spread guest usage, will “only be cleaned when guests have vacated them”.More disinfectant dispensers will be made available throughout Tui’s hotels, while “extensive new cleaning practices” will be put in place for rooms. Areas such as bathrooms and heavily used devices such as TV remote controls “will receive particular attention”.“Customer surveys clearly indicate that safety and hygiene will be of paramount importance for holidaymakers after the lockdown,” said Sebastian Ebel, a member of the group’s executive board. “We are laying the foundations for an agile and safe return to business so we can be ready to offer our unique holiday experiences again as soon as possible.”Tui said that it will be training all of its employees at its own hotels, starting this week. At partner hotels not operated by Tui, there will be a training and inspection programme using the hygiene and safety consultancy Cristal International Standards.Tui said that its 10-point plan is in addition to statutory regulations at any holiday destination where it operates.The company also said that the destination measures it has published form part of a wider package that includes plans in its retail outlets, flights, transfers to hotels, local excursions offered to holidaymakers and cruises.“With this set of measures we are creating a framework required to ensure we can offer our guests enjoyable and safe holiday experiences as soon as travel restrictions are lifted,” said Ebel.Tui has been forced to cancel trips affecting almost 1 million holidaymakers. At the end of last month the company cancelled all beach holidays involving travel on or before 11 June.Cruises later in the year are also affected after the company postponed the launch of Tui River Cruises until 26 November.

Travellers will undergo further temperature tests at the airport, must wear face masks or other coverings and wash their hands and use hand sanitiser in terminals.On board the aircraft, they will be able to buy pre-packaged snacks and drinks, using cashless payments only. Queuing for toilets will be prohibited on board, although inidual passengers will be able to use the facilities “upon request”. Physical distancing at airports and onboard will be encouraged where possible.The measures include fewer checked bags and a deep clean of the aircraft every night with chemicals that are effective for more than 24 hours. All Ryanair planes are fitted with Hepa air filters similar to those used in critical hospital wards, the airline says.Since the Covid-19 flight restrictions were imposed in mid-March, Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. The pandemic has forced airlines around the world to ground their fleets.As a temporary public health measure, while EU countries emerge from their Covid-19 lockdowns, Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July and August to fill in details at the point of check-in of how long their planned visit will be, and their address while visiting another EU country. This contact information will be provided to EU governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations.The Ryanair chief executive, Eddie Wilson, said: “It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work, and restart Europe’s tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs.”Other airlines including Wizz Air and KLM have also announced a return to flying. The British Airways owner, IAG, had been planning to run 1,000 flights a day from July, but its chief executive, Willie Walsh, said on Monday it would review its plans in light of the UK government’s plan to quarantine people arriving by air. He said the number of flights would probably be “pretty minimal”.Michael O’Leary, the group chief executive of Ryanair, brushed off the 14-day quarantine, from which French and Irish travellers will be exempt. He said the exemption showed the quarantine period was not based on science, passengers would ignore it, and the UK government lacked the police resources to check on people.He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I don’t think this 14-day isolation will be effective. It will have no credibility among the travelling public, but it is manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3b99d1ec3646ddc6b2d8790cc5213afa9a8989/268_193_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8a83223559caac0035f7fd8ef8f450","title":"tories lockdown social distancing testing second wave coronavirus","story":"Easing social distancing without a proper programme of testing, contact tracing and isolating will lead to a second wave of coronavirusThere are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, contact tracing and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.It’s almost impossible to decipher which path the UK government has chosen. Over the past months, its response has vacillated from the third approach to the second and, more recently, to the first. While Boris Johnson’s address on 10 May made clear he has recognised the dire position in which the UK finds itself, the government’s confusing new advice – that people should “stay alert” to the virus, work from home when possible, but go to work if working from home isn’t possible – exemplified the mixed messages coming from the government.The confusion turns on an internal struggle between two opposing camps. The first seems to think the government should attempt to get over the worst of the pandemic by allowing the virus to spread through the population, albeit at a slower pace to ease the strain on the NHS, and by creating more hospital and mortuary capacity to cope with a spike in deaths. The second camp wants to drive down the number of coronavirus cases and reduce the rate of infection – or R – to as close to zero as possible. It recognises the uniquely dangerous nature of this virus, and the emerging evidence that it can cause long-term health complications in survivors and that immunity may only be temporary.These are clearly two different goals, with two different strategies behind them. The confused messaging from the government is a worrying illustration of the lack of consensus on which of these objectives and strategies should be adopted, both within Westminster and across the four nations.But this debate misses a more fundamental point: containment (the first path) is the best strategy for public health, the economy and society. The decision in early March to shift from containing to mitigating the virus was disastrous on all three of these fronts. By the time the government introduced a lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases had already increased exponentially, making prolonged quarantine necessary.Now, the key challenge facing the government is to replace this lockdown with a package of public health interventions involving mass testing, surveillance and real-time data to identify clusters of the virus and quarantine those who are infected. This will mean providing adequate PPE to those who need it, enforcing border controls and instigating a phased relaxation of social-distancing measures. Rather than putting everyone under lockdown, these measures would give health authorities information about the spread of the virus, allowing them to identify hotspots and target interventions where they’re needed.Without these measures in place, the past seven weeks of lockdown will have been completely pointless. As quarantine measures are lifted, the virus will continue to spread, the number of daily cases will rise and a second peak will become inevitable. Everyone agrees that we need to get out of the lockdown as soon as possible, but doing so will require massive investment in public health infrastructure. Countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia have already built this capacity, allowing them to ease measures while retaining control over the virus and identifying who has it, who has had it and who could be exposed to it.The social costs of lockdown are severe. Seven weeks in, we’ve witnessed the increased use of food banks, delayed care for those needing NHS services, the closure of schools, rising cases of domestic abuse and bankruptcy among small-business owners. So why has the government made such little progress in building the public health infrastructure necessary to control the virus and ease the lockdown? You could be forgiven for thinking that the lockdown was simply a way to reassure the public that the government was “doing something”. We need to be asking: what measures has the government put in place to ensure we’re in a better position to release the lockdown and prevent a second wave?Everyone wants to know when the lockdown will end and life will go back to “normal”. The better question to ask is how we ease lockdown measures in the coming months and years while preventing a second wave of infections and keeping R well below one. There are a number of endings to this story. First, an accessible and affordable vaccine could become available within the next 18 months second, the government could embark on a resource-intensive and gruelling campaign to eliminate the virus, particularly if emerging data proves coronavirus is as dangerous as diseases such as smallpox and polio or third, antiviral therapies could become available to treat Covid-19 that make it a mild illness, so the population would gradually and safely build up natural herd immunity. But on our current path we seem destined for a disastrous ending. Lifting lockdown without the public health infrastructure in place to contain the virus will allow Covid-19 to spread through the population unchecked. The result could be a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable, and an inidual gamble for those exposed to the virus. This should be avoided at all costs.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/479348bfffd989c204332c2487f7fc3459cf620f/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387a1e3bb954b1836f7c3c640be88c7b","title":"its ok for teachers to cry how to handle bereavement in school","story":"Teachers will play a crucial role for children who have suffered grief and trauma during the coronavirus lockdownIt was a Friday afternoon. With lessons over for another week, Jill Evans, a deputy headteacher in Herefordshire, set off for a weekend away, telling the school’s head, Julie Rees, her friend and colleague, that she would see her on Monday.She didn’t. Over the weekend Evans, 58, was killed in a car accident. By Monday morning, Rees was not only having to process her own grief but also putting structures in place to help Ledbury primary’s 440 pupils, plus staff and parents, through the enormous emotional fallout the tragedy would bring.Rees’s experience has become exceptionally relevant in these days of coronavirus, as heads and teachers begin to prepare for a return to the classroom. Whenever that time comes, one thing is already clear: many children will have experienced grief and trauma since they were last in school, and school will have a crucial role to play in helping them and their families process their emotions in the time ahead.Looking back to the period around her deputy’s death, in January 2019, the biggest thing Rees says she learned was the resilience of human beings in the face of shocking and unthinkable circumstances. “I’d never imagined I’d have the resources to deal with what I had to deal with,” she says. “If you’d told me I was going to get that call, I’d have thought I’d be a wreck. So I’d say to teachers: believe in yourself in these difficult times, in your inner strength, and trust your intuition about what’s the right thing to do.”The first thing Rees did, on the Monday morning after her colleague died, was to give staff the flexibility to run their classes any way that felt right. “I told the teachers it was up to them to decide how to use the time in class,” she says. “With grief you need time to respond to the children’s emotional needs. You have to make sure there’s plenty of flexibility in the timetable, and that’s how it will need to be when schools go back.”As well as the trauma affecting almost all children, many may have lost a family member – a grandparent, or even a parent – and could be experiencing the death of someone close to them for the first time. “We all process grief in different ways, and that’s as true of children as it is of adults,” says Julie. “Some will be angry, some in denial, some just carrying on with their lives. What’s important is that they know there’s somewhere they can go and someone they can talk to.”After Evans’ death, Rees set aside a room in school for time out, with a counsellor on hand. “If people were having wobbles they could go there and sit quietly or talk, and the staff needed that support as well as the children.”As is so often the case, supporting children means supporting their families, too. Another of Rees’s initiatives at Ledbury primary was to establish a Monday morning parents’ drop-in group. “We invited parents for coffee in the staffroom, to talk to one another and to support one another,” she says.That model of peer support was extended to pupils, as it will surely need to be when school resumes after the coronavirus shutdown. “We focused on encouraging two things: deep listening, and noticing,” says Rees. “Our message to the children was: don’t judge anyone who is crying or angry. Instead, ask them about it. And don’t give advice just give them space to talk.”Phoebe Gilbert, 21, knows all about being a grieving pupil – she was eight when her mother, Lesley, died suddenly. Along with her father, Ian, and siblings, William and Olivia, she has written a book on how schools and teachers can help, called Loss: a Little Book of Bereavement for Schools.She agrees with Rees that it is vital to acknowledge what a bereaved child has gone through and is continuing to go through. “It meant so much to me, especially on a day like the anniversary of Mum’s death or her birthday, that someone would give me a supportive look or a cuddle – some signal that they knew this was a day when I’d have an especially heavy heart.”Grieving can be lonely, including for children. If teachers are prepared to share their grief, and even their tears, that can be helpful, says Gilbert.“You feel on your own when you’ve lost someone, and we all need to come together. So I’d say to teachers: cry with the children. If a child sees a teacher crying, that’s teaching the child that it’s OK to feel sad, it’s OK to show it, and it’s OK to talk about it. We learn so much from how we see teachers behave – so much more than what they actually teach us in the classroom.”Her father, Ian, founder of Independent Thinking, a platform for educational practitioners to share ideas, says it is vital teachers understand that grief can hit children in waves from nowhere, and they might need to talk or to cry at any time. “One thing that helps is to give them cards they can hand to a teacher when they need help, or to get out of the classroom for a while,” he says.He thinks there will be a need after schools go back to honour those who have died by, for example, holding special assemblies, and says these could be particularly helpful where it was not possible to attend a funeral, or when there might not even have been one.He feels strongly, too, about the need for teachers to be aware of “post-traumatic growth”.“All three of my children value this sense of growth in their own lives,” he says. “With grief and loss come opportunities to grow and learn and to be a better person. It can help bring purpose to a life – a young person might think, how can I share my experiences? How can I use them to help others?“So there are potential positives. And that’s why it’s important not to make death into a big taboo that we don’t talk about, because if we do, we’re likely to miss the opportunities.”Winstonswish.org has information on how schools can support bereaved children and specific advice for the coronavirus pandemicLoss: a Little Book of Bereavement for Schools is published by Independent Thinking Press"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d91c78e814a8e1c237237a814caf5ea6de00cf5d/3_30_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7001cc7ff779ed48e31cc7db65cf6e4","title":"like the open university we now need an open school for the whole country","story":"A national online centre could help children catch up after lockdown and revitalise all schooling for the future When the Covid-19 emergency is over, schools will face a monumental task. Children who have been learning at home will need support in making the transition to the “in school” curriculum. The needs of disadvantaged youngsters, who will have fallen even further behind during the closure, will have to be a priority. We cannot just think of the lockdown as a very long holiday with schools able to pick up as if nothing had happened.Many teachers have been displaying great ingenuity in the way they have provided home support and online learning. The best models – such as the Oak National Academy, a hub of resources created by teachers – will still be highly relevant in the post-shutdown period. Meanwhile, the BBC has provided a magnificent range of resources with the backing of government and local authorities. Only the Beeb really has the reach, competence and multimedia capacity to rise to this challenge. Open Schools of great repute exist around the world. In Canada, the Open School of British Columbia has existed since 1919, and offers a rich range of resources and courses for all school grades. In Australia, Victoria’s Virtual School also goes back more than a century. These open schools were created to serve isolated communities but now provide a service to the whole school sector. Any teacher, and anyone else, can access the support provided.If the UK had an Open School, what would it look like? We believe it needs to be a free-standing, independent institution offering high-quality self-learning, tutored courses and resources in every subject. It should explain how teachers in schools could incorporate these resources into their teaching. It could create a forum for networking for students of all ages, learner to learner, school to school, across districts, regions, nationally and internationally.It could sponsor innovatory projects – particularly in response to the challenges of creating genuinely inclusive learning. And it could build a network of tutors, inside and outside schools, skilled at offering enrichment activities to the many, but also expert at helping youngsters who have fallen behind.At the primary level, an Open School would be a huge support for those teachers who do not have a background in the subjects they teach (languages, mathematics and science, for example). It would be especially important for older students. There are tens of thousands who, for health or social reasons, need teaching outside the formal school context.At secondary age, students might have some subjects taught in a conventional way and others through the Open School. Every student would have a much richer range of learning opportunities than those offered by their own school’s timetable. What better way to address the motivation challenge of the adolescent years?And schools might start to feel different. The preoccupation with crowd control, behaviour, even exclusion, could become part of history in a move towards inidual, personalised timetables.There would be a cost, but against the vast sums the chancellor is working with it would be pocket money to set up. And we could start now. The BBC, and organisations such as Oak National Academy, offer a core. An Open School would have the very best resources from a range of providers.Some subjects, mathematics, for example, might be given priority. Others would follow. Get the decisions right about structure and the Open School could be fully set up by the end of next year.The Open University could advise on infrastructure. Maybe the BBC should take a lead. This would be an institution and a resource for all time. The Open University astonished the world with the quality of its resources and courses. An Open School would match that achievement.• Sir Tim Brighouse was the London commissioner for schools.

Not so from men.“Negligible number of submissions to the journal from women in the last month,” she posted on Twitter. “Never seen anything like it.” The response was an outpouring of recognition from frustrated female academics, saying they were barely coping with childcare and work during the coronavirus lockdown.“I was taken aback by the nerve I seem to have hit,” she says. “I have now heard many stories from women of abandoned projects, collaborations they have felt unable to continue with, and so on. It’s extremely worrying, especially so for philosophy, which already has so much work to do in terms of gender equality among its ranks.”Having articles published in academic journals is key to being promoted at many universities, and is a critical measure of success in the government’s all-important Research Excellence Framework, which distributes around £2bn of annual funding to universities.Hannon is worried that the additional lockdown childcare, as well as caring for older family members and an increase in chores such as cooking and cleaning, is slowing up female researchers far more than their male colleagues.Dr Jenny Hallam, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, who is currently home schooling her two boys, aged seven and four, while trying to do her job, isn’t surprised. She loves doing research, but it has become a luxury she can no longer squeeze into her exhausting lockdown schedule.Two days a week she is the sole home teacher, snatching the chance to work where she can. The other three days she and her husband, who is also an academic, do relay childcare. In the evenings she catches up with emails from students who are struggling to adjust to online teaching. She is coping, she says, but it is “overwhelming and tiring” and the days feel very long.“Research has fallen by the wayside,” she says. “It’s important and I want to do it, but it’s not as urgent as supporting my students. My students and my children have to be my priority.”On top of that, Hallam has heard back from a research journal to which she submitted a paper before the lockdown, wanting her to make revisions by early June that she can’t find the time to do. She notes the journal took two months less than usual to respond. “Perhaps the reviewers aren’t parents,” she says drily.“I wrote back explaining why I would struggle to make the deadline. The editor declined an extension, saying deadlines were important,” she says.Dr Anneli Jefferson, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University who is also home schooling her two boys, of nine and 12, agrees that research is the first thing to suffer when time is short. “Research is really important, but it’s not urgent. It’s not usually the thing that someone’s breathing down your neck about.”She thinks anyone with a family will be slowed down by lockdown – “but women will probably be disadvantaged more strongly”.“Many female academics will have partners with a more structured job with online meetings that are non-negotiable,” she says. “And it must be even harder for single mothers, because they are doing all this on their own.”Prof James Wilsdon, director of the new Research on Research Institute based at the Wellcome Trust, worries that the coronavirus is skewing a playing field that wasn’t ever level in the first place. “We have to be very cautious that we are not privileging those who are able to use the coronavirus situation as time to race ahead of their peers, who are held back not by talent or aspiration but by the need to do homeschooling and put three meals a day on the table,” he says.He agrees that research is not really compatible with family life in lockdown. “Research requires headspace and the ability to immerse yourself over a prolonged period.”Wilsdon, who is himself juggling work and four children at home, says: “This is also about the ision between those who have caring responsibilities and those who don’t. But I’d be the first to admit that women bear the brunt of the problem.”And the issue goes beyond journals, he says. UK Research and Innovation, the national funding body for research, and other funding bodies, are fully aware that many women will also be struggling to find time to enter competitions for new research funding. Wilsdon points out that raising money for new research is extremely important to universities, but it is less of apriority than the challenges of shifting teaching online. “No one is standing over you saying you must apply for a grant, so in a sense that becomes even more of a luxury than writing a research paper for a journal.” This worries funders, he says, but there is no easy solution.Dr Viki Male, an immunologist at Imperial College London, says there is “definitely a danger” that female academics might be taking more of a hit in the lockdown than their male colleagues and competitors. She is looking after her children, aged three and six, as well as trying to run her lab, give lectures – including a new one on Covid-19 immunity – and check in with her research students. She often notches up 16-hour days of work and childcare. She is quick to point out that her husband has taken on a lot at home too, but because she earns less, and can be more flexible about when she works, the bulk of the childcare falls to her.“It made sense for me to be on domestics from 9 to 5,” she says. “I suspect, around the country, couples have had the same sorts of conversations we had. It probably reflects systemic ways in which men’s and women’s jobs often differ.” She is concerned that women might be falling behind in the race to publish their research, and argues that even if all universities and funders agreed to make allowances for researchers who couldn’t publish during lockdown, those with caring responsibilities would still be left behind because others had had extra time to progress their research.Wilsdon, however, says that in his more optimistic moments he hopes some good might come out of the lockdown for women, and that universities might be forced to confront calls for more flexible working.“All the juggling and the hidden labour of domesticity that is part of many academics’ real lives is now being brought into view ,” he says. “Maybe when those things are raised in the future, universities will be better at understanding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86d7acb4cd4e4e00bb564a127d2ca5e0d9621cf1/0_129_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad9133ef0edf0c946ed9acd7718d1e9","title":"the magnificent one how little richards style shaped david bowie prince and elton john","story":"The musician, who died on Saturday aged 87, was a pioneer in looks as well as sounds, influencing everything from James Brown’s quiff to Prince’s midriff‘Little Richard scared my grandmother in 1957,” wrote John Waters in 2010. While his grandmother’s fear was largely about the singer’s sound – that trademark shriek at the start of his hit Lucille – his look had a formative impact on the 11-year-old Waters. It is thanks to Little Richard that the film director has the deliciously fake pencil-thin moustache that his fans know and love today.Waters’ moustache is just one example of Little Richard’s influence on fashion and style. Images of Little Richard, born Richard Penniman, in his 5os heyday show a proud, decade-appropriate quiff – forget Chuck Berry and Elvis, this was the best in the business – plus a mascara-ed moustache, panstick makeup and the look of kohl around his eyes. James Brown, who was a Little Richard impersonator, learned the power of good hair from him. The Godfather of Soul began his career in the late 50s with a quiff worthy of Little Richard.The kohl and panstick makeup gave clues to Little Richard’s journey. He was thrown out of home at the age of 13 some writers – and even sometimes Little Richard – argued this was down to homophobia, with his father taking offence at his son’s queerness (he later said he was “omnisexual”, before denouncing this term). The teenager then spent time as a drag queen, taking the stage name Princess Lavonne. “I used to call myself at the time the Magnificent One,” Little Richard says to Waters of his early career. “I was wearing makeup and eyelashes when no men were wearing that.” He called himself “the king and queen of rock’n’roll”.Little Richard was light years ahead of his contemporaries when it came to experimenting with fashion as part of his image – to celebrate flamboyance, to be a complete rock star. His first outfits were smart, boxy suits but not the kind for work. These came with wide-legged trousers that allowed movement, such as slamming a brogue on to the piano. He later wore wigs – to make that tonsorial statement even more impressive – along with sparkles, crop tops, jumpsuits and headbands. He was the blueprint for the anything-goes permissiveness that developed on stage over the coming decades.While his career was suspended when Little Richard retired from showbusiness for religion in 1957, a return to live performance in the 60s coincided with the emergence of a new generation of musicians. This is when Little Richard’s showman style began to develop. He toured Europe in the first half of the 60s, with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles supporting him. They learned from Little Richard how to own the pomp of rock stardom. “Mick Jagger used to watch my act,” he once said. “Where do you think he got that walk?”Elton John, meanwhile, supported him as part of the band Bluesology in 1967 and no doubt took note of the winning combination of wild outfit and wild piano playing. And Jimi Hendrix, a man destined for many “rock star style” Pinterest boards? He played guitar in Little Richard’s band.By the 70s, Little Richard was wearing Rudi Gernreich-style onesies at airports, sequinned kaftans on TV and tie-up blouses on stage. The guitarist Steve Van Zandt, in his tribute to Little Richard, said that part of his legacy was a “flamboyant androgyny which would become an essential part of rock’n’roll”.David Bowie and Prince are often – rightly – cited as music’s great fashion innovators, playing with gender in fashion and pushing the boundaries when it comes to the optics of male sexuality. Both owe debts to Little Richard – and acknowledge them.“Little Richard was just unreal,” Bowie told Rolling Stone. “Unreal. Man, we’d never seen anything like that.” Prince, meanwhile, paid tribute in looks. On the cover of his 1986 album Parade, he is photographed in a crop top, with quiff, mascara and pencil moustache. Little Richard took the compliment, and added a bit of shade. “Prince is the Little Richard of his generation,” he told Joan Rivers in 1989, turning to the camera to address Prince himself: “I was wearing purple before you was wearing it!”With more modern performers, such as Bruno Mars and Janelle Monáe, still referencing Little Richard, his status as a style pioneer is in no doubt – more than 60 years after he scared Waters’ grandmother."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b000e83d41a0ecbaef96e6d18843ddd8780b73b/0_424_3770_2262/master/3770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee714e46f8f25b28bd4cdd0a399197d","title":"ive never seen the magnificent seven","story":"In one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts Kurosawa’s thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns … but it’s fun!I used to be indifferent towards cowboys. I’ve seen a few of the famous westerns, but I didn’t grow up watching them. When lockdown began, however, I started playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the Xbox for hours every day, and my opinion warmed. Red Dead borrows from all the major films in the genre, and now I’ve finished the game I find myself hungry for more cowboy stuff. Next up is The Magnificent Seven.I know this one contains a famous theme song, which I recognise from parodies and adverts, as well as seven men who are magnificent in an unspecified way. I may have even caught snippets on TV as a kid, but they probably bored me at the time: The Lord of the Rings was always my go-to for horses and violence.I’ve also heard The Magnificent Seven was inspired by Seven Samurai, another “classic film” directed by Akira Kurosawa. (I saw this at university, where I briefly studied film.) Seven Samurai follows a group of samurai who are hired to protect a village from bandits. Many regard it to be the pinnacle of cinema, and likewise I thought it was very good.So I’ve retrieved my unopened DVD of The Magnificent Seven. A leaflet inside says that Kurosawa was “so impressed” by the film that he presented the director John Sturges with a ceremonial sword. But according to an interview in 1966, Kurosawa actually thought it was “a disappointment” – so maybe the sword was more out of politeness.As for me, I thought it was fun! Especially the first act, when Yul Brynner first assembles the Seven and we learn each of their unique character traits: the laidback one, the hotheaded one, the one who wears ties, etc. Brynner is enigmatic and Steve McQueen is cool, but my favourite is James Coburn as the steely Britt, who can outdraw a gunman with a throwing knife.I hadn’t realised that The Magnificent Seven is not only “inspired” by Seven Samurai, it’s a direct remake. The Magnificent Seven lifts the plot of Kurosawa’s film, changes the setting from feudal Japan to Mexico, and swaps the samurai for gunslingers. The story translates well into the old west, although The Magnificent Seven is over an hour shorter, meaning some of the nuance of the original is lost. Much of the interaction between the villagers and their saviours has been cut. The Mexicans don’t say all that much while the mostly white gunmen rescue them, which adds a racial undercurrent that hasn’t aged well.So yes, in one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts the thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns. But a fairer comparison for The Magnificent Seven might be A Bug’s Life, the Pixar film where an ant asks some bigger insects to protect his nest from grasshoppers. Again, it’s the same plot, but when I left the cinema in 1998 I don’t remember anyone saying, “Those ants are an insult to Kurosawa.”There are some new additions to the story, such as the bandit leader Calvera, whose role has been expanded. Eli Wallach does “absolutely livid” very well. The Seven spend a chunk of the middle of the film negotiating with him, which gets dull, but things pick up again at the final battle. There’s a sense of jeopardy here, even if a couple of death scenes felt rushed. I was furious to see Britt throw BARELY ANY KNIVES before he goes.Now for some more westerns. Maybe I’ll try the Magnificent Seven sequels: Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, and The Magnificent Seven Ride! Given that four of the seven are dead by the end of the first film, I’m very interested to know where they take this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e0559af6a4efcecdc71084cd96fb1329c1a872/0_779_7996_4798/master/7996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7959fdb4056da823ed689b96e7e13b92","title":"joe cornish id be very interested in directing a biggleton feature film","story":"A new baby is dictating the viewing in the Cornish household and bringing a new appreciation of TV’s Better Things We have a nine-and-a-half-month-old daughter, so we’re watching a lot of Hey Duggee on CBeebies, which we love, and also a lot of Biggleton, which is fantastic. Biggleton is a live action show acted by five and six-year-olds. They’ve created a whole town with shops, a vet, a TV station, florist, science lab and town square. It’s like Bugsy Malone for the under-fives without the weaponry. I enjoy watching actors who fiddle with the hems of their shirts and look like they desperately need to go to the toilet. I’d be very interested in directing a Biggleton feature film. I’d do a Die Hard With a Vengeance-style action adventure movie with huge action sequences and car chases and explosions, then at the end they’d all do the Biggle Wiggle.At nine-ish, I sneak downstairs to the little room I’ve kitted out as a home cinema. The best thing I’ve seen in ages is Bacurau, which is a surprising, surreal sociopolitical western set in Brazil. It’s best to watch knowing nothing about it. Just go in cold. As a movie buff, I’ve always got a huge back catalogue of Criterion Blu-rays which I buy to feel intelligent but have never quite got round to watching until the lockdown. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed rewatching Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove, Orson Welles’ The Magnificent Ambersons and David Byrne’s True Stories.TV-wise, I’ve really enjoyed Devs, and Better Things, which is all about the everyday life of a mum with three daughters in Los Angeles. As a new father, it seems like a truthful depiction of bringing up girls. It stars an actor called Pamela Adlon, and has a fantastic performance by Celia Imrie as her batty, British mum. Mikey Madison plays the eldest daughter: she also played the Manson girl who was hideously burned to death with a flamethrower in Once Upon  a Time in Hollywood. I haven’t shown my own daughter Once Upon a Time in Hollywood yet. I’ll wait until global culture becomes so debased that they’re showing Tarantino movies on CBeebies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0165b238f2683a61e34e84f596748f76798fc1df/0_712_1709_1025/master/1709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7507d62c30ba7750d731275575922f2d","title":"jack monroe tribute to tinned fish four easy recipes for lockdown","story":"Four easily adaptable dishes from the UK’s queen of thrift, using tinned fish and other store-cupboard ingredients 1 large onion (red or white)1 x 90g tin or jar anchovies in oil400g fresh mushrooms (the meatier, the better)1 tsp thyme, rosemary or dried mixed herbs1 tbsp butter (or 1 tbsp extra oil)1 tsp vinegar (white- or red-wine, or cider, are best, but any will do at a pinch)Black pepper, to tasteFirst, peel and finely slice the onion.

The Premier League’s test says applicants must not provide “false, misleading or inaccurate information”.Saudi Arabia has previously claimed BeoutQ originated in Cuba and Colombia. However in January the Gulf state was named in a European Commission report for its failure to crack down on the platform.Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and La Liga are among the sporting bodies that have attempted to take legal action to shut down the platform in Saudi Arabia, but nine local legal firms have declined to take on the copyright case.Meanwhile Saudi Arabia remains on a US government “Priority Watch List” as one of the “notorious markets for counterfeiting and piracy”.Recently BeIN’s chief executive, Yousef al-Obaidly, wrote to the Premier League and its clubs warning of the “danger of allowing the acquisition” given what he identified as Saudi Arabia’s direct role in BeoutQ’s “illegal actions and their direct impact upon the commercial interests of the Premier League”.The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, urged the Premier League to consider the “damage” that BeoutQ’s pirating of broadcasts had caused the sport before deciding on the Newcastle takeover.Amnesty International has also asked the league to consider blocking the takeover because the fund is overseen by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, saying he has been involved in a “sweeping crackdown on human rights”.The Premier League refused to comment when contacted by the .

Then came a freakish climaxEighteen extraordinary seconds. That was all it took for the pendulum to swing from dejection to delirium for Watford almost seven minutes into stoppage time, with Manuel Almunia keeping out Anthony Knockaert’s penalty with his feet, then blocking the rebound with his chest before Troy Deeney rifled the ball home at the other end to send the club into the Championship play-off final at Leicester’s expense. That freakish finale is the maddest moment Vicarage Road has witnessed.Deeney’s finish was emphatic, prompting home fans to spill on to the pitch. A minute earlier Knockaert had zoomed beyond Briggs into the box, where he fell despite little contact with Cassetti, luring Michael Oliver into awarding a penalty, a decision Watford’s then manager, Gianfranco Zola, said the referee apologised for last year. “I felt my mistake led to Cassetti giving away the penalty,” Briggs says. “At the time I was blowing, jelly legs and nursing a groin injury. Knockaert dropped a shoulder and I couldn’t move my feet quick enough. I was gutted but if that doesn’t happen then Deeney’s goal doesn’t happen … I still watch it back on YouTube now and get goosebumps every time.”Zola galloped down the touchline but tumbled as a delirious Jonathan Bond, Watford’s back-up goalkeeper, attempted to get to grips with him. The scene of stewards, substitutes, supporters and coaching staff entangled and engulfed by the celebrations is reminiscent of a Renaissance masterpiece. Briggs hauled his teammate Joel Ekstrand, grounded amid the chaos of the pitch invasion, to his feet and spotted a friend mobbing Deeney, who had whipped off his shirt and jumped into the crowd to embrace his brother, Ellis. For Deeney, it was a moment of ecstasy at the end of a season that began behind bars at Winson Green prison in Birmingham.For Rob Mackenzie, the buildup to that day began in earnest 200 miles away in the directors’ box at Bolton. On the final day of the regular season Mackenzie, then Leicester’s head of technical scouting who is now head of scouting at OH Leuven, was tasked by the manager, Nigel Pearson, with feeding updates to the Leicester dugout at Nottingham Forest. Leicester had to better Bolton’s result against Blackpool to sneak into the play-offs and Knockaert scored an injury-time winner to edge out Bolton on goal difference.“I was on the phone for what felt like an absolute eternity for the last five minutes of stoppage time, relaying what was going on,” Mackenzie says. “I wasn’t sure what to do. Do I commentate? Do I just sit here in silence? The final whistle goes and I was out of that stadium as quickly as possible. I ran to my car and I felt like Mourinho wheeling down the touchline. I was the only person in that stadium who was happy that day. To go to that game I had to give up usher duties at a friend’s wedding in south Wales but I somehow managed to get there before the speeches.”Mackenzie was responsible for opposition scouting and set to work on how to beat Watford. The first leg went to plan, Leicester winning 1-0, but the second ended in tears, Matej Vydra scoring either side of a David Nugent header before Deeney lashed in Watford’s third. Vydra’s opener was a sumptuous volley but, at the end, only one Watford striker’s name was on the lips of supporters. For the second half, Mackenzie was behind the away dugout.“It was like panning a widescreen camera from right to left,” he says of the decisive passage of play. “A couple of weeks earlier Doncaster got promoted from League One when Marcello Trotta hit the crossbar for Brentford with a penalty and they broke down the other end and James Coppinger walked the ball in to win the game. I thought: ‘Is this normal now?’”Knockaert, having won the penalty, was determined to finish the job but a teenage Harry Kane, on loan from Tottenham and a second-half substitute, also wanted to take the spot-kick. Unused on the bench was Jamie Vardy, who signed from Fleetwood the previous summer and had four league goals for Leicester he now has 119. Knockaert said he didn’t sleep for three nights but he returned revitalised the following season, when Leicester were promoted as champions under Pearson. “If ever there was a strength-of-character test, then that was it,” says Mackenzie, influential in signing the winger from Guingamp.In November 2013 Knockaert scored in a 3-0 win at Vicarage Road as Leicester recorded their 14th win in 19 league matches. “I think that showed the character the team had and he had, and I remember that was a really big win for the lads in terms of mentally putting that game to bed,” says King. “Fair to play to him for being able to brush something like that off. And it would have been easy for the Leicester fans to turn after a situation like that but they still love Anthony now.”When Watford’s players returned down the tunnel, the majority topless, Zola praised their resilience and character. “And then it was like: ‘Now celebrate,’ and we opened a crate of beers,” says Briggs. “It felt like we had won the final, just because the game was so dramatic.” The then Watford midfielder John Eustace, a substitute, recalls a party atmosphere. “It was rocking in the dressing room,” he says. “As soon as we went in, everyone sat down and shook their head. Nobody could believe it.”Zola has since said Watford over-celebrated. They lost to Crystal Palace in the final and, ironically, the only goal came from a penalty after Cassetti fouled Wilfried Zaha. That was nothing compared with the drama a fortnight earlier. “You try to re-rationalise what you have just seen and what has happened but you can’t,” Mackenzie says. “We shook our heads all the way home. Your brain does not consider that a possible or suitable end to a football game. But it very much was, unfortunately for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8730560592009ce0983569efd142b0ef1d1ae5/716_6_2846_1708/master/2846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88a546258cfac7dfd39b9bb1fd3285a9","title":"greyhounds florida new homes","story":"Dog racing was due to end in the state next January but Covid-19 has prompted a hasty volunteer effort for out-of-work dogsRetirement is treating Pat C Rollo well. Just weeks after the coronavirus pandemic closed his workplace for good, he has moved into a modern apartment in south Florida and enjoys long, leisurely walks watching the yachts on the Intracoastal Waterway before heading home for a nap. He even has a new name – Lambo, short for Lamborghini – as a reminder of the fast-paced industry in which he once worked.It was a swift, and fortunate, transformation for a racing greyhound who never distinguished himself in 97 outings over 20 months under the Rollo moniker, yet always seemed to enjoy the thrill of chasing an electric hare around the track at the Daytona Beach Racing and Card Club.When Daytona’s owners, starved of paying customers due to the Covid-19 lockdown, brought down the shutters on 20 March after 71 years of live greyhound racing, Lambo and 600 other greyhounds suddenly found themselves not just out of work, but instantly homeless. Thanks to a hastily scrambled caravan of volunteers from the Awesome Greyhound Adoptions agency willing to drive the 420-mile round trip from Boynton Beach, several dozen dogs traveled south to temporary foster homes or, as in Lambo’s case, permanent new digs.“We’re keeping each other going,” says Lambo’s new owner, Courtney Portela, 38, a bartender from Boynton who also lost her job in the pandemic. “I’m helping him out by showing him a good new life, and he’s helping me out by keeping me motivated at a time when everything’s up in the air,” she says of the three-and-a-half-year-old she calls her “45mph couch potato”.Portela saw on the news that Florida’s greyhound tracks were closing because of the pandemic and that dogs were in need of homes, but that doesn’t reflect the magnitude of the challenge that has befallen the state’s network of adoption agencies almost instantaneously.Other long-established greyhound racing tracks in Naples and Sanford closed permanently in short order of Daytona, the former having soldiered on with televised races but no spectators for several weeks before bowing to the inevitable. Meanwhile, circuits in West Palm Beach, St Petersburg and Jacksonville suspended operations indefinitely with their futures uncertain. It left 1,500 greyhounds, by many estimates, in need of immediate rehoming. Roughly another 3,000 are still in kennels at the remaining three venues, all of which must close by law at the end of the year anyway when Florida becomes the 41st state to outlaw commercial dog racing.Even so, Amendment 13, the 2018 ballot initiative that ended dog racing by a two-to-one majority, and which was reaffirmed by a federal judge last month, allowed for an orderly, rolling program of closures by January 2021. The intention was to allow the volunteer groups time to absorb the dogs instead of being overwhelmed all at once, but coronavirus has upended that situation.“With tracks closing earlier than expected, it’s a perfect storm of greyhounds needing homes at one of the worst times in US history,” said Dennis Tyler, president of Greyhound Pet Adoptions of Central Florida. “Fortunately most of the groups in Florida scattered dogs across the country to different groups that could take them and start the adoption process, but Florida is saturated with greyhounds as far as local adoptions.”Rescue groups hastily assembled teams of volunteers to drive hundreds of dogs to sister agencies in California, Tennessee and New England. Others, from the Naples track in particular, will race on for the time being, in Arkansas or at Iowa’s sole remaining track in Dubuque, before eventually being rehomed as pets.“It’s a much better place to be doing it,” Tyler said. “You can disperse them to Canada and northern states. In Florida you have to get a couple of states out to where it’s not overloaded with greyhounds.”Barbara Masi, founder of the Awesome agency, a non-profit that works specifically to rehome former racing dogs, which found Lambo his new home, said “greyhound nation” was stepping up at a time of need. “Approved groups all across the US have 50 or 100 applications sitting there waiting for greyhounds to come,” she said.“Locally, we put out a plea for fosters and new adopters, and though the ones we brought were a minimal number, 23 have been adopted right here.”The Greyhound Retirement Foundation of Tennessee sent a cavalcade of vehicles from Knoxville to retrieve 60 dogs from kennels at the Sanford Orlando Kennel Club when racing ended there abruptly in March after 85 years. “We’ve adopted out probably 30 of them already,” said director Brenda Stafford, who added that the suspension of “meet and greets” in her local Petsmart’s parking lot had been another challenge to overcome. “Our foster homes are the real heroes of this, taking care of greyhounds that need to leave the track and begin another career as a pet.”If things are looking up for the dogs, the same could not be said for Florida’s 3,000 kennel owners, trainers and track employees, many now out of work after decades in the industry.“It’s been devastating,” said Jack Cory of the Florida Greyhound Association, which operates as a voice for industry workers. “Fortunately we have two responsible tracks in West Palm Beach and St Petersburg where they have been helping out the kennel owners with a subsidy each week to help take care of the animals.”Ultimately, Cory says, every retired racing greyhound in Florida deserves a new life in a loving, permanent home, like Lambo. “He’d never been in a home before, he was pretty clueless,” Portela said. “He didn’t understand the hardwood floor, he kept walking into the sliding glass door, he doesn’t know how to do stairs, he’ll stare at himself in a mirror for hours.”“I had to push my boyfriend to get him, and moments after he arrived my boyfriend was like, ‘OK, when can get another?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7bba7f8fee506b494c90a49d3b4db33f56fcbc/0_58_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f37e8dbd3a5ebaebb92923e2674684","title":"more birds and bees please 12 easy expert ways to rewild your garden","story":"Now is the perfect time to boost the bioersity of any outside space you have – whether by buying your cat a bell or ditching the insecticidesWith humans – and our polluting, road-killing, noisy machines – largely out of the way, nature is having a big party. This is one of the few positives of lockdown to which we can cling, witness and even encourage. “The land taken up by gardens in the UK is greater than the area of all our national nature reserves,” says Mark Fellowes, a professor of ecology at the University of Reading who specialises in interactions between humans and wildlife, as well as urban ecology. Everyone with outside space, he says, “can become a nature reserve manager. You can do really simple things to affect bioersity where you live.”These days, even the most lackadaisical gardeners are taking a greater interest in whatever outside space they have, not least because panic food-buying seems to have segued into panic food-planting. Grow bags have become hard to come by and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has reported increased inquiries about growing fruit and vegetables.But whether or not people are growing new things, terraces, balconies and gardens are receiving unprecedented levels of attention this spring. If we employ a few bioersity-boosting tricks, we can keep the nature party in our backyards going for good.As such, investing in a pest-proof feeder is important. Fellowes recommends those that close if a squirrel, or anything heavier than a small bird, lands on them.  This does not mean bird tables should be banned, but Fellowes recommends “putting small volumes out regularly, clearing it up and putting out food the squirrels don’t like”. Goldfinches love niger seed, for example, which squirrels eschew.“Disease can spread through feeders every now and again,” says Fellowes. “Our greenfinch population was badly affected by trichomonosis that was probably spread via bird feeders. It’s not definite, but all the circumstantial evidence points in that direction.”When people get nest boxes, says Fellowes, “they get very keen and they can put cameras in the boxes. It’s fantastic: nature on your doorstep that you can really connect with.”Birds such as blue tits and great tits would naturally nest in nooks and crannies in woodland trees, so boxes are important in cities, especially if you live in a modern development. Fellowes recommends WoodStone, brick or woodcrete boxes. Not only will they last longer, he says, but also, “if you have wooden nest boxes, woodpeckers can raid them and predate the chicks”. Of course, this would happen in the wild, too, but it is a bit of a buzzkill if you are enjoying the chicks.Fellowes suggests trying boxes for a variety of birds: “You can get nice ones for robins, nuthatches and sparrows, which haven’t been doing brilliantly – a lot of that seems to be around losing nesting sites.” You can buy swift boxes, too, and even bricks made specifically for swifts or bats, if they are in your area (they tend to be near water in urban zones). Nest boxes need to be cleaned out at the end of the year. “As fantastic as it is to watch leopards in South Africa or cheetahs in the Serengeti, that’s not our nature,” says Fellowes. “The nature on your doorstep is just as interesting and worthy of attention.”Birds can’t feed their chicks the seed you put out. Chicks need bugs, so it is not a good idea to kill them. “Urban birds tend to have fewer offspring than ones in the countryside,” says Fellowes. “That’s probably to do with the amount of insects that are available to feed on in the breeding season.”Unless you are competing in the Chelsea flower show, he says, “your garden can deal with a few aphids. And if you allow natural insect populations to grow, you will attract ladybirds, which eat aphids and have crashed in numbers.”You can’t have butterflies and moths without caterpillars. “As we have simplified and tidied our gardens, we have provided fewer plants that the caterpillars can do well on,” says Fellowes. “Some of the most beautiful species feed on nettles and brambles, and most people won’t want those in their gardens. At this time of year, holly blues are laying their eggs on holly.” They feed on ivy, too. So let a little corner of your space stay wild.Fellowes suspects that, if you have room, this is the biggest thing you can do for insects – “and all bioersity in your garden. Ponds across the UK have been disappearing at a massive rate.” They are vital for swallows and swifts, as well as amphibians such as frogs, toads and newts and insects including dragonflies, damselflies and water boatmen. Size is not important. Mini ponds can be made in a bucket, an old sink or something similar. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds’ website explains how to make one. Lionel Smith, a colleague (and former PhD student) of Fellowes, has spent years developing a nature-lover’s alternative to a lawn. “Lawns are really not very ecologically friendly,” says Fellowes. “Not much lives in them and, if you fertilise, mow and water them, they’re a net CO2 contributor, rather than a typical plant that helps absorb CO2.”Covering up the spaces between neatly arranged ornamental plants with bark chippings is not great for bioersity, says Fellowes. If you want to control what plants grow in your beds, it is healthier to grow your chosen plants more densely together – another reason the cottage garden explodes with nature. Perhaps you won’t balk when a dandelion pops up when you know that pollinating insects love them.“I would never suggest anybody must follow my unkempt way of gardening,” says Fellowes. “But if you’re a neat freak, think about how you can get your aesthetics while using species that will also benefit wildlife. Anything positive you do will have an effect. You don’t have to let your garden turn into a jungle.”“I absolutely wouldn’t use pellets or the powders that you can put out to kill slugs, simply because hedgehogs can eat them and be poisoned,” says Fellowes. The old beer-trap method is a more responsible way to kill slugs. There are endangered species of slugs, says Fellowes, “but you won’t be getting those in your garden”.Slugs are excellent food for hedgehogs, amphibians, beetles and birds, so you may consider them worth having in that respect. There are humane traps, too, so you could relocate your slimy garden chompers to somewhere they will be more welcome.Fellowes is always doing research on cats. A few years back, Fellowes’ team calculated that domestic cats in the UK were killing about 185m prey items a year. “About a million birds a week,” he says. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says that domestic cats rank third globally among alien species threatening vertebrates. Keeping cats indoors as much as possible is recommended, especially at peak hunting times (dawn and dusk) and if you live near a nature reserve. Also, putting warning bells on collars, says Fellowes, “certainly reduces predation rates”.Dump them on a compost heap, or just leave them in piles to rot down, and make a home for small mammals, amphibians and invertebrates such as centipedes – “just like in natural woodland”, says Fellowes. They could take months to break down, so you have to think carefully about where to leave them.Similarly, leaving a little pile of chopped wood will attract stag beetles and solitary bees. Alternatively, you can buy homes for the bees from garden centres. “They’re at their peak at this time of year,” says Fellowes. The homes “attract leaf-cutter bees, which are really cool to watch”. Slow worms love compost heaps, too, and one of Fellowes’ few sightings of a grass snake was in his own suburban compost heap.The thing to avoid in all of this, says Fellowes, is becoming judgmental. Decking, for instance, may not be the best thing for nature, but if you need it for practical reasons you can still invite nature in with bird boxes and thoughtful planting. “These are things that we can all do,” he says.30-Second Zoology by Mark Fellowes is published by Ivy Press.

I pay back £400 a month and still owe £10,000. All my freelance work has dried up due to the shutdown and I applied for universal credit.I contacted Sainsbury’s Bank about taking a payment holiday but all it would do was delay my next payment by a month. But despite agreeing, it still took the £400 payment. This emptied my account and led to my card being declined while food shopping.When I called to complain, the only solution offered was to make an indemnity claim on the payment with my bank but then I’d be in arrears on the loan.At the start of the crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority was quick to tell loan providers to offer consumers a three-month payment freeze. It seems, in your case, the person processing your call simply didn’t apply this. At least after we took your case, Sainsbury’s Bank moved quickly to put it right. It has now apologised, applied the full three-month payment holiday, refunded the £6 overdraft fee and will pay you a further £125 for distress and inconvenience.Better news for those looking for travel refunds. Eurostar this week announced more generous cancellation terms and has promised cash refunds.Previously, it was pushing customers into taking vouchers that had to be used to make a booking before the end of September for travel by the end of April 2021.After many complaints, it has said customers have 12 months to make a new booking, and a further six months to travel to its “core” city destinations – or nine months to its seasonal stations such as Disneyland Paris or the south of France.Passengers have complained that trains were cancelled only 48 hours before they were set to depart, in an apparent bid to get customers to accept vouchers rather than refunds. The advice is not to do anything until the day before you were due to travel, if you want a cash refund.Meanwhile, readers who bought flight tickets, but paid using PayPal rather than a credit card, have reported getting full refunds for cancelled flights. SH writes: “I supplied the correspondence from Ryanair – the cancellation plus original email offering a refund and subsequent one offering a voucher – and I received notification that the money was back in my PayPal credit account within a week. Hope this helps others in the same boat.”BA customers are now reporting being offered refunds, too, after phoning the company.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Nearly a decade later, with the MP3 era a speck in the rear-view mirror, the way to create a streaming smash is both more open and more complex. But it’s not always as pricey. Lil Nas X shelled out just $50 (£40) to create Old Town Road, a cheering country-rap daydream that became the longest-running No 1 in US chart history, racking up 19 weeks at the top. It spent two weeks at the summit of the UK Top 40 in April 2019.Despite the song’s ubiquity, it was difficult for anyone to truly hate. That’s largely thanks to Lil Nas X’s charismatic, gravel-voiced performance in which he raps about “bull riding and boobies” over trap beats and (thanks to a Nine Inch Nails sample) the loneliest-sounding banjo in the world. A year before Old Town Road’s release, he had been sleeping on his sister’s floor: his faux-flexing in the lyrics (“Cowboy hat from Gucci  Wrangler on my booty”) adds an absurdist yet autobiographical twinge to the song, evoking an underdog hustling for a life of greater means. But Old Town Road wore its creator’s struggles lightly and its straightforward, knowing silliness made it fly. It begs for choreography as much as a Steps song, and duly inspired TikTok’s viral #YeeHaw challenge (think plaid, lassos, and “Yee-Yee juice”). The dance app rocket-fuelled the song’s rise and cemented TikTok’s power to make trending songs into bona fide hits. (A year later, music’s A-list are catching up: Drake leaked his new single to TikTok, and Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj have remixed its biggest songs.)A meme demigod with a bright smile, Lil Nas X didn’t plant Old Town Road on TikTok himself: it was first picked up by a user named @NiceMichael. But he turned out to be his own best advocate – for his music, online, and himself, when he came out last summer. As Old Town Road first started to climb Billboard’s country songs chart, the US country establishment closed ranks, excluding the song from the tally. Lil Nas X responded with philosophical grace (“I think people are just ready for something different, a change within the world”), but the move stands as a grim faux pas that seems racist and looks even more embarrassing in hindsight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7cf406a48f3af31107a6fb927a8d11ed80d0106/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=534cfa390532674f7915b204b34f013d","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown part 1","story":"Lockdown has changed the way we date.

That’s the message we want to see adhered to in our society.”It aligned Northern Ireland with Scotland and Wales, which had also rejected Johnson’s new messaging, he said.The Stormont assembly is due to debate the roadmap after it is announced by Arlene Foster, the first minister and Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader, and Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minister and Sinn Féin deputy leader.Both parties sparred in the early stages of the pandemic – Sinn Féin wanted to close schools before Downing Street recommendations – but now present a united front in steering a policy that in several aspects sets Northern Ireland apart from the Republic of Ireland as well as England.Speaking at a Covid-19 briefing on Monday, Gordon Lyons, a DUP junior minister, warned against complacency. “It will be a grave mistake to believe we have beaten Covid-19. We just don’t owe it to the NHS, we owe it too ourselves. Social distancing will be with us for a very long time.”Lifting of restrictions would be “gradual and phased”, he said. “After eight weeks of lockdown, I know many of us are desperate to get back to the life you had before.”The blueprint will detail the scientific and health criteria that must be met for moving to each of the five stages. A key criterion will be the R-value, or reproduction number, which is estimated at 0.8-0.9. Authorities want to push it lower before easing restrictions.Outdoor gatherings of four to six people that observe physical distancing are expected to be allowed in the first stage. Cafes, restaurants and pubs will have to wait until step five to reopen, and schools until September.Northern Ireland has registered 438 coronavirus-related deaths, a per capita rate significantly below that of England and on par with Ireland. However, the Unite union has warned that the devastating toll in Northern Ireland’s care homes could be repeated in meat-packing plants unless there is mass testing and deep cleaning. A worker based at a Moy Park plant in Dungannon died after contracting coronavirus, part of what the union said was a cluster in mid-Ulster.The republic is to begin its own five-stage lockdown exit plan on 18 May, with intervals of three weeks.Critics have accused authorities in Belfast and Dublin of paying lip-service to coordination instead of forging an all-island strategy, as happened with previous disease outbreaks involving animals. Some of the republic’s highest infection rates are in counties along the 310-mile border, fuelling concern about possible spillover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e4eb28f6e7f3c7cf3e84a816e1cc1ef84f6a26/0_344_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc15eed888acfdeb25f0511338c6c24","title":"uk national security council has not met since january","story":"Lack of meetings prompts fears it is being made deliberately redundant amid Covid-19 crisisBritain’s national security council – a meeting of senior ministers with military and spy chiefs – has not met since late January and there are no plans for it to come together this week, prompting growing concern in some quarters of Whitehall.The high-level body used to meet weekly under David Cameron and Theresa May but has only done so sporadically since the election, and some fear it is being made deliberately redundant during the coronavirus crisis.A meeting was cancelled last week and multiple sources confirmed there were no immediate plans to rearrange, despite tensions with China over the origins of Covid-19 and a recent return by the RAF to bombing Islamic State positions in Iraq.Key decisions across government are being made by the all-male “Covid quad”, a morning meeting involving four leading ministers plus the prime minister, a tight decision-making model preferred by Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings.The four are Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary Rishi Sunak, the chancellor Matt Hancock, the health secretary and Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who acts as a cross-Whitehall fixer.Some fear classified material is being discussed at the meetings where advisers without a high level of clearance are present, although a No10 source said that was not the case. Decisions involving intelligence were taken as needed elsewhere, they added.The decision not to hold NSC meeting was “a pragmatic response” to the coronavirus crisis, the source said, which involved an urgent shakeup of Whitehall machinery, and that the body remained important.But Labour warned security threats such as terrorism and cyber-attacks had not gone away. Conor McGinn, the shadow security minister, said: “At a time when the UK is facing threats to its national security every day, it is deeply worrying that the NSC hasn’t met for months.“The prime minister should urgently convene the NSC and ensure it meets weekly, as it has done for the past decade.”Ministers who would normally be closely involved in national security discussions but appear to be excluded from the decision-making are Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary.Wallace unexpectedly let slip at a defence select committee meeting last month that the NSC had not met during the coronavirus crisis. Its last full meeting involving ministers and service chiefs was at the end of January, to sign off the decision to allow Huawei a limited role in the UK’s 5G network.A Downing Street spokesman said: “We do not routinely comment on matters regarding the national security council. The government continues to protect the UK’s national security while addressing the pressing demands of the Covid-19 pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e41d309e033ce097c147f518dd9b2ebf9b33f3/0_591_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39530aff5fcead9e694c02cfcdb5b1cb 1400w","title":"gp doctor on how the coronavirus pandemic has progressed edinburgh","story":"Following his previous in-depth account of the early days of the outbreak, Edinburgh GP  Gavin Francis reports on how he and his practice have dealt with the escalating crisis since lockdownBy the time the schools closed in late March, my GP consulting room in Edinburgh had been emptied of clutter, its surfaces rendered easy to wipe down with disinfectant. It felt as if the decks had been cleared. There are almost 4,000 patients at my practice on the south side of the city, close to the university. As the lockdown began, my colleagues and I were spending our time phoning two or three hundred of the frailest, as well as the 30 or so who had been advised by the government to “shield” from the virus until July at least. On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a “key information summary” – an electronic précis of their principal medical issues – available for paramedics, A\u0026ampE and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety. I had little sense of how severely it would hit us, and how much planning would be enough. The speed of its arrival was startling, and the past six or seven weeks have been unlike anything I’ve known in general practice. Now that restrictive lockdown measures are starting to be eased, cases will surely climb. My GP colleagues and I have all seen some patients with Covid-19, but because of the effectiveness of the lockdown, fewer than forecast in those dark days of March. Two of our patients have died of it – about the same proportion, 1 in 2,000, as have so far died of the virus nationwide.The agility of the NHS in response to the crisis has been impressive. Our practice has four GPs and two nurses all still travel to and from the clinic every day, and the four receptionists are still fielding and triaging calls. The appointments book is filled as usual, but now with names for the clinicians to phone back, rather than with appointment times for patients to come in.The NHS is notorious for its slow uptake of technology – I still use fax machines and pagers daily – but we can now text patients’ phones with a link to open a video call to our aged desktop PCs. There are still clinical problems for which a physical examination is imperative: those I do at the practice if the patient is fit enough to come in, or at their home if they’re not.Either way, I wear a mask, apron and visor, and two pairs of gloves. As aspiring GPs we were taught to value the subtleties of human communication – to carefully attend to body language, to silences, to the way a patient holds or evades eye contact. In a mask and visor, I feel less like a GP than an old-school surgeon, oblivious and insensitive.Two “Covid hubs” were set up in Edinburgh just before lockdown came in: one for telephone triage and one for face-to-face assessments. (A third was opened a week or two later, but then closed, because there weren’t enough patients to justify it.) The idea was to keep patients with coronavirus away from their usual GP surgeries, where risk of cross-infecting others was high.I spent the evening of 19 March at the telephone triage hub, when cases were still climbing steeply, with a glued-and-Sellotaped headset, one finger in my uncovered ear, speaking to patient after patient reporting the same pattern of symptoms: a dry irritating cough (as the virus irritates the upper airways), lack of smell (as the nose becomes infected), headache, a tight chest, fever, and a bone-weary, sagging exhaustion. A few complained of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, as the virus upset the digestive tract. And fear: everyone was frightened by what they had heard about this virus.The sickest patients were directed to the other Covid hub for a face-to-face assessment, and I began work there the following week. There is an efficient system in place to keep staff and other patients safe: each patient is met at the door by a nurse in mask, gloves and apron, and has their name and date of birth checked. The patients are given a mask and gloves to put on themselves. They are led down a corridor to the assessment room – a freshly mopped, stripped-out clinical space – and offered a seat. The doctor waits outside the room, puts on mask, apron gloves and visor, and goes in once the patient is alone.My training as a GP emphasised the importance of building empathy and rapport, but on shift in the Covid hub I stay as far from the patient as possible until the moment of actually examining them, even taking their medical history from the far side of the room. I remember seeing a middle-aged man there who had flown in from Italy not long before lockdown. Another who had caught the virus at his mother’s funeral. A builder who’d had a sick workmate on the last site he worked before lockdown. A young mother who thought she’d caught it on the train from London.On shift one Thursday evening, we all stopped at 8pm to listen for the sound of clapping, but the clinic is surrounded by hospital buildings, and the night was silent. “It makes my toes curl anyway,” said one of my colleagues. “I’ll be glad when it stops.”“I like it,” I said. “It’s the one time of the week I get to see all my neighbours.” For me, those Thursday rituals are far more about people cheering one another, than they are about thanking the NHS.Scotland was at an earlier stage in the spread of the disease as lockdown came in even so, nationwide distancing measures should have come in earlier – by early April, with the upswing in cases steepening, we could all see that. Making call after call, seeing patient after patient, I thought how we’d been like toddlers on the beach, watching the waves edging ever-closer up the sand, but still squealing with shock when the water rolled over our toes.On 3 April, Boris Johnson, at home isolating with coronavirus, posted a video online. He was visibly overbreathing, interrupting his sentences to take brief gasps. Two days later, he was admitted to hospital, and on 6 April he was moved into intensive care. The BBC was publishing flow charts of how the transition of power would work if the prime minister died.The trajectory of his illness was by now familiar: a week or so of flu-like symptoms, and then, between day seven and day nine, just as most patients start to improve, the onset of worsening breathlessness. Covid-19 has been called a “biphasic” illness, for these two phases – the first “virological”, as the body confronts the virus, and the second “immunological”, as misdirected messages from the immune system thicken the lungs and the lightest, airiest part of the body becomes sodden with fluid.In my part of Lothian, there are usually two cars providing emergency GP home visits at the weekends and in the evenings. A few days after Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital, I was out in Car 2, driving to a visit in the most urgent triage category, which means getting to the patient within one hour. The experience was a fairly typical snapshot of what it’s like to make home visits as a GP right now. On the phone, the patient had said that after a week of flu-like symptoms he was breathless even when lying on his sofa, and had a fever. It was early evening as I drove to his house. Westering sunlight was turning the suburban streets golden and blackbirds were singing in privet hedges. I phoned the patient from the car for directions. His breath came in gasps, his sentences interrupted.“Are you alone?” I asked. Yes. “Can you sit near the door?” Yes. “Just to warn you, I’ll be wearing an apron, mask, visor, gloves. I’ll give you a mask and gloves to wear, too.” OK. “If you sit near the door, it’s easier for me – I won’t have to come all through the house to find you.” OK.I ignored the twitching curtains of the neighbours, the kids out on their bikes. Earlier in the shift, leaving another home visit, a patient had asked me, “Can you shout to the neighbours that I don’t have Covid?” Now I stood at the back of the car, opened the boot, and began The Great Faff – another new protocol to get accustomed to. Thermometer, oxygen sensor, stethoscope, all placed into a clear plastic bag. Apron on, mask on, gloves on. Then a second pair of gloves over the first. The apron flew about in the wind. (Some of my colleagues have been sellotaping the thin flapping plastic to their legs.) Visor on last – its frame was 3D-printed in green plastic, with clips for attaching a head strap to the back, and a clear acetate shield to the front. On the inside of the forehead band was written Car 2 in permanent marker.At the patient’s front door, which was ajar, I breathed in the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The man was sitting on a stool just inside the door, elbows on his knees, bracing his chest with his arms to better move air in and out of the lungs. He was wearing grey pyjamas that had lost a couple of buttons.“How are you doing?” He grunted an acknowledgement. “Can you manage on with one of these?” I handed him the mask, but he couldn’t tie the strings of it. Wishing my forearms weren’t bare, I leaned over him, holding my breath, and knotted the ties at the back of his head and neck.I counted his breaths – fast, at 28 per minute. I put a digital thermometer in his ear and it flashed red with an impressive fever. I put an oxygen sensor over his finger – by shining light through the skin, it can gauge the oxygen content of the blood. His was worryingly low. His pulse, even sitting down, was galloping along at more than two beats a second.“Could you stand up for me?” I asked. We shuffled awkwardly on the small landing in a doleful dance. He turned his back and I lifted his pyjamas to place my stethoscope on his back. The sound of air through his lungs was accompanied by a quiet hissing sound, like sizzling fat. The sound of pneumonia. In his case, pneumonia probably caused by Covid-19.“I’m going outside, then I’ll phone you about what happens next,” I told him. I picked up the clear bag with my stethoscope, oxygen sensor and thermometer, and stepped out, trying to hold central to my awareness and every action that there was virus on the walls, the door handle, my gloves and all my equipment.Out on the doorstep I gulped down the fresh air, then it was back to the rigmarole: topmost layer of gloves off and into a waste bag. Still wearing my underlayer of gloves, I took a chloride wipe and began to clean all the equipment – stethoscope, oxygen sensor, thermometer – and placed them into yet another clear plastic bag, ready for the next patient. The wipe went into the waste, then my apron. Next it was the visor’s turn to get cleaned, and afterwards I placed it on the ground to dry. Then undergloves off, mask off, the clinical waste bag tied off and sealed, and back into the car.With the donning and doffing of PPE, and cleaning all the equipment, home visits now take far longer than they used to. I’d be happier wearing a gown in addition to the gloves, mask and visor – it would better protect my arms, trunk and legs from droplets carrying the virus. But for now, there are no gowns available. A few days earlier, I had looked through the supplies of gloves and masks that had been delivered to my practice from central government stores: the masks were stamped with the name of a Canadian company, manufactured in China, and distributed by another in Germany. My gloves were all manufactured in Malaysia or Vietnam. If we’re to get this equipment to the people who need it in the UK, we need manufacturers here – and production should have started in January.From the car I dialled the man’s number again. All those years learning about personal consultation styles, and now I was breaking bad news by telephone from a car parked outside. As I waited for him to pick up, I glanced at the car mirror. My forehead was stamped with Car 2 in reverse, transferred in sweat from the visor headband.“I think it’s likely that you have coronavirus,” I heard myself say, “and that it’s affecting your lungs, causing pneumonia. That’s why you feel so breathless.” Silence. “I’ll arrange for an ambulance to come and take you to hospital.”I waited. His breathing was audible. “Is there anything you’d like to ask?”“How long for?” he said.Heading on to see the next patient, I passed the ambulance I’d just called, on its way to collect him. The paramedics both waved, and I waved back – one, who wasn’t yet wearing his mask, smiled. One of the few consolations of this pandemic is its grim camaraderie, a new fellowship among the fear.Later on I walked along from the GP clinic to the A\u0026ampE department to see how my patient had fared. One of the nurses called up his x-ray on the screen: the lungs should be light and spongy, the blackness of air clear against the white of the ribs, diaphragm and heart. But an “infiltrate” had clouded his lungs. Where there should have been a black void, there were speckled galaxies of white.“How old is he?” the nurse asked me.“Mid-50s,” I said. “Like the prime minister.”“Overweight?” she asked. I nodded.“They’re all like that, up in ITU,” she said. “Strange days.” We paused together for a moment in silence in front of the x-ray, before she had to attend to another patient, as did I.Throughout April, I watched maps online showing the number of cases growing worldwide, with red dots bloomed into wide circles, like spores in a petri dish. Between 1 April and 15 April they doubled from 1 million to 2 million deaths tripled from 50,000 to 150,000. Epidemiological studies were published showing that without limitation on its spread, the coronavirus has the potential to cause 30 million deaths, comparable to the Spanish flu of a century ago.Meanwhile, the lack of testing in the UK, even among healthcare staff, was becoming alarming. One of my colleagues came down with Covid-19 symptoms on a Friday, couldn’t get tested until Monday, and by Wednesday evening we were still waiting for her result. Five days from symptoms to result, five days of not having a GP working. Five days, as well, of the GP’s husband – a hospital doctor – not working, as he, too, had to self-isolate.As hospital cases plateaued in April, the virus began to take hold in nursing homes. There are two nursing homes on my practice’s patch in Edinburgh one had an outbreak affecting four or five patients, but it was swiftly and professionally contained. None of the residents died of it. The staff reassured me they had sufficient PPE. I began hearing stories of nursing homes that weren’t so lucky – that had seen every resident infected, and a quarter had died. I also heard of homes that had no protective masks or gloves.At the same time, it was obvious that, in the wider community, lockdown was helping slow transmission. The numbers in ITUs (intensive therapy units) dropped consistently from a peak around 9 April. We GPs were sent a message of praise from the hospital, thanking us for doing so well at keeping people away. But it was becoming harder to field patient frustration at the shutting down of much of what the NHS used to do. No outpatient clinics, no colonoscopies, no sexual health services, no routine x-rays – so much has been put on pause. Even cancer services have been stripped back to essentials, and many routine lab tests have been cancelled to create capacity for coronavirus testing.Many whose mental health was already tenuous before the crisis now feel unmoored, desperate and angry. The inescapable uncertainty that comes with the disease is particularly difficult to live with, and I’m grateful, as a GP, to at least have reliable work. For those whose jobs offered identity and a sense of purpose, being furloughed has been a tragedy exacerbated by forced disconnection from friends and family. Many children, my own included, are missing the structure and social life of school, and every day I hear of more best-laid plans being added to the bonfire of this global crisis.The UK maintains relatively few critical care beds in comparison with its neighbours. Before this crisis, there were around 40 ITU beds in Lothian for a population of 850,000.. Now that number has been increased to 113. With the new critical beds added, the UK is at roughly the same levels as pre-pandemic Italy and Bulgaria.The peak of Covid-19 bed occupancy in Lothian’s ITUs was on 9 April, when there were 42. Ten days later there were 30, and they stand now at 11. A friend who is an ITU consultant in the Midlands told me that only four in 10 of his patients who are intubated due to Covid-19 survive it.On Sunday 10 May, Boris Johnson relaxed some lockdown measures for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland kept their own stricter measures in place. Johnson encouraged a return to work, but asked people to avoid public transport, and said that driving to work and to places for exercise would be permitted. I asked my ITU friend what he thought of the speech. “No mention of facemasks in public? Everybody in their cars? I think it’s an experiment at the expense of the English,” he said.On 7 May, the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, had extended our lockdown, shortly after recommending the use of “cloth face coverings” on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing isn’t possible. On 10 May, she announced that she had “asked the UK government not to deploy their ‘stay alert’ advertising campaign in Scotland”. The message in Scotland, Sturgeon said, was not “stay at home if you can”, but “stay at home full stop”.The lockdown has already had profound social and economic consequences. It’s likely that unemployment is going to soar this summer, and unless robust housing legislation is put in place, so will evictions. On my occasional work at the Access Practice, a GP clinic providing health services for Edinburgh’s homeless population, I’ve seen how they’re preparing for a surge in need.In late March, the Scottish government, public health officials, charities and local authorities came together to mitigate the worst of the pandemic’s effects on homeless people, with an initiative brokered by the charities Streetwork and the Bethany Trust. By the evening of 24 March, 80 of the city’s rough sleepers had moved into rooms in one of the city’s empty hotels. With homeless shelters closing to minimise the spread of Covid-19, another hotel was opened as a temporary night shelter. Mobile outreach clinics were set up in each hotel, and rapid detox and methadone programmes initiated for those who needed them.I was due at the outreach clinic in one of the hotels last week, but just before attending, I came down with a viral headache. I felt weak, nauseated and feverish, so instead of going to the clinic I went to a test centre, where a knitting needle of a swab was plunged into the depths of my nose.While waiting for the result, I phoned Rankin Barr, the service manager of Streetwork, to arrange a visit to the outreach clinic, and asked him about the effects of the lockdown. “The people presenting for emergency shelter are not your traditional rough sleepers,” he said. “Many are coming from domestic problems, relationship breakdowns – with lockdown they can’t stay with family, can’t go to B\u0026ampBs.” We spoke of how much had been done so far – of the rapid setting up of clinics, of food provision, immigration advice and vaccination programmes, and how the city council was even now procuring more emergency accommodation for the emerging social crisis. The calamity of the pandemic has triggered a new attitude and approach to the city’s chronic housing shortage. “This virus has changed everything, but there’s an opportunity from now to do things differently,” Barr told me. “The city and public health authorities are completely on board. We just can’t lose all the vital work that’s been done.”My result came through: negative. I felt better, and will be able to visit the outreach clinic later this week. On the phone recently, I asked one of the doctors organising treatment for the homeless, John Budd, how many cases he’d had to deal with. “We’ve been lucky so far – unbelievably, there has only been one confirmed case. That’s perhaps symbolic of just how marginalised the homeless are from society. But when it enters this relatively closed community, it will spread like wildfire,” he said. “But this virus is like Voldemort,” he laughed. “We know it’s out there, we just don’t know when it’s coming back.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6c8bf8a6fdce9eccb6ba760587b230d423bde3/423_546_3399_2040/master/3399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a11509b1812caf128f4268628c2be82e","title":"my favourite game manchester united v barcelona cup winners cup 1984","story":"Saved by a tractor tyre, we watched two-goal Bryan Robson inspire a 3-0 victory over Diego Maradona’s BarcelonaIt was one of Old Trafford’s greatest nights – and by repute its loudest – and but for a tractor tyre I would never have been there. There to witness Manchester United overturn a two-goal first-leg deficit to beat Diego Maradona’s Barcelona 3-0 in the European Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-finals.Travelling up from Hampshire that day in March 1984, I picked up a new Peugeot we were road-testing for my local paper and I went to collect my companions – both New Zealanders – at the farm where they were staying. I arrived and went inside, forgetting to apply the handbrake. Luckily the car rolled gently into that tractor’s wheel when it could have ended up being wrecked.With that narrow escape, we were off to the match. As we made our way to the ground you could feel the excitement and tension building. By kick-off the atmosphere inside Old Trafford was raucously passionate. The largely standing crowd ebbed and flowed and I felt like a piece of flotsam carried back and forth on the human tide.That energy transmitted itself to United’s players who started with a dynamism that was to blow away a Barcelona side managed by César Luis Menotti, who had led Argentina to victory in the 1978 World Cup final.Ron Atkinson had told United to treat it as a one-off game and they attacked fiercely from the start. Leading the charge was Bryan Robson and, with the Barcelona defence and their goalkeeper Urruti teetering, the United captain scored in the 23rd minute from close range following a corner.Maradona was largely ineffectual, his season having been disrupted by a broken ankle six months earlier and he was nearing the end of his sorry sojourn in Catalonia. So, much rested on Bernd Schuster but the German’s efforts in midfield were not enough with Robson rampant, ably abetted by Ray Wilkins and Remi Moses.Robson struck again five minutes into the second half, when Barcelona were caught trying to play their way out of trouble and he forced home after the ball had rebounded off Javier Urriti, who had failed to hold Wilkins’s effort.The noise level was deafening and three minutes later United led the tie after Barcelona’s defence was once again found wanting when the ball was in the air. Robson, with a swerving, offside-trap beating pass, picked out Arthur Albiston racing down the left and his high cross to the far post was met by Norman Whiteside. He headed the ball back across goal for Frank Stapleton to score from a yard out.With more than 30 minutes left a Barcelona goal would have changed the complexion of the game but they rarely threatened. If their players looked somewhat bewildered it was not surprising given they had never before lost a European tie taking a 2-0 lead into a second leg.At the end United’s players were engulfed by their fans, with Robson being carried shoulder high. It had been a night to savour but for United it did not get any better. In the semi-finals against a Juventus side containing Michel Platini and Zbigniew Boniek they were knocked out 3-2 on aggregate by Paolo Rossi’s last-minute goal in the second leg in Turin.As we headed back to the car we took with us the sound and the glory, and we had plenty of time to relive the experience. Thick fog around Spaghetti Junction slowed us to crawl and we missed our turn for the M5, finding ourselves on the M1 instead. But it hardly mattered and getting home at 4am was a small price to pay for a magical night at the Theatre of Dreams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d238ac9e70ec862bf34ca9fd1ee54896a8b05d2/0_70_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3159df5889a65620efabc655f8fa2cdd","title":"sebastian vettel to leave ferrari formula one team at end of year reports","story":"Sebastian Vettel will leave Ferrari at the end of the year after contract negotiations between the four-times world champion and the team broke down.The 32-year-old’s deal concludes at the end of 2020 and despite both Ferrari and Vettel previously expressing their ambition to extend it, Vettel bluntly stated there was now “no longer a common desire” to work together.Vettel won the world championship four times with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. He joined Ferrari in 2015, with both parties optimistic he would return their first drivers’ title since 2007. However neither drive nor team have proved able to match the dominance of Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton, failing to really challenge for the title.Vettel insisted the decision had not been motivated by a failure to agree on money but Italy’s Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper recently reported he had been offered only a one-year extension with a salary reduction. The German has been clear in the past for his preference for a three-year period.“The team and I have realised that there is no longer a common desire to stay together beyond the end of this season,” he said. “Financial matters have played no part in this joint decision. That’s not the way I think when it comes to making certain choices and it never will be.“What’s been happening in these past few months has led many of us to reflect on what are our real priorities in life. One needs to use one’s imagination and to adopt a new approach to a situation that has changed. I myself will take the time I need to reflect on what really matters when it comes to my future.”Ferrari have already made a long-term commitment to Vettel’s teammate Charles Leclerc, with a contract until 2024. They have been open in their belief that Leclerc represents the future. The team principal, Mattia Binotto, stated that Vettel and Ferrari no longer shared objectives.“It was not an easy decision to reach, given Sebastian’s worth as a driver and as a person,” Binotto said. “There was no specific reason that led to this decision, apart from the common and amicable belief that the time had come to go our separate ways in order to reach our respective objectives.”The decision has reopened the drivers’ market, with one of the most sought after seats in F1 now open. Both Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz of McLaren are out of contract at the end of this year and considered to be potential replacements. It also raises once more the possibility that Hamilton, whose contract also concludes this year, could switch to the Scuderia. The British driver, who has won five of his six world titles at Mercedes, has, however, made clear his intent to stay with his current team.For Vettel the decision may preempt his retirement as he has few options to continue in a competitive car on the current grid. Mercedes are understood not to be interested in signing him while Red Bull have said they are satisfied with Max Verstappen as their No 1 driver. There may be options at Renault or McLaren but both teams are firmly in the mid-field and as things stand in no position to challenge for wins.Ferrari openly declared Vettel to be their No 1 driver last season, stating they would favour him over Leclerc, who was in his debut year with the team. However it was the 22-year-old who comprehensively outperformed the German, beating him in points, wins and poles. There had been tension between the pair, including a prearranged track-position agreement falling apart in Russia and a crash in Brazil. Ferrari had already announced that this season the pair would be allowed to race without favouring one over the other. Leclerc insisted their relationship remains amicable.“It’s been a huge honour for me to be your teammate,” he wrote on Twitter. “We’ve had some tense moments on tracks. Some very good ones and some others that didn’t end as we both wanted, but there was always respect, even though it wasn’t perceived this way from the outside.”Formula One has yet to hold a race this season because of the coronavirus outbreak but is still aiming at staging 15-18 meetings. The first round is due to take place in Austria on 5 July, immediately followed by another at the same venue before holding a further double-header at Silverstone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2da4f2fcbae53eba724c2eec08ee0d2d28383e/48_0_1043_626/master/1043.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dc57d9c2db86085c0874b2be395e69aa","title":"tesla factory reopening elon musk california lockdown","story":"CEO announces electric carmaker will begin production on Monday after company sues county over Covid-19 restrictionsElon Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would resume production at its northern California factory on Monday afternoon, in defiance of a local public health order designed to slow the spread of coronavirus.“Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules,” the billionaire CEO tweeted. “I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.”Musk’s announcement followed a weekend of escalating threats by the entrepreneur against the county that is home to Tesla’s only car factory in the US, in the city of Fremont. On Saturday, Tesla sued Alameda county, alleging that the local public health order violated California’s constitution. Musk also threatened to move its headquarters and “future programs” to Texas or Nevada “immediately” and suggested that the company may not continue to “retain Fremont manufacturing at all”.Musk has for weeks railed against restrictions put in place to mitigate the spread of the virus that has killed nearly 80,000 people in the US and more than 285,000 people worldwide. The billionaire entrepreneur has become one of the most high-profile purveyors of misinformation about the virus, regularly promoting false messaging about the disease to his more than 34 million Twitter followers. Musk has also appeared to lend his voice to the fringe political movement equating public health measures with government oppression, referring to shelter-in-place orders as “fascist” and tweeting messages such as, “FREE AMERICA NOW.”Musk’s most recent grievance stems from the fact that his factory is located in a part of California that has stricter rules for reopening than the rest of the state. On 7 May, governor Gavin Newsom announced rules to allow some manufacturers to reopen on 8 May. However, the statewide rules do not supersede local restrictions, if they are stricter, and many of the state’s most populous counties, including seven counties in the San Francisco Bay area, have decided to keep in place their more stringent rules through the end of May.On Monday, Newsom said during his daily press briefing that he was not aware Tesla had reopened but that he had “great expectations that we can work through at the county levels”, adding: “We look forward to many, many decades of that relationship with Tesla.”State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.Any arrests at the factory are highly unlikely. A spokeswoman for the Fremont police said that the department has not yet issued a single citation for violating the coronavirus public health order in the city of approximately 240,000 people, and that “all matters have been mitigated through compliance”.The spokeswoman referred questions about Tesla to the county public health department. “We do enforce the order at the health officer’s direction, but we have been told they are in active talks with Tesla surrounding safety protocols,” she said. “We have not received any additional information or direction.”The county health department said Monday that it was aware that the Tesla factory was operating beyond the “minimum basic operations” that are allowed, and that it had “notified Tesla” that it was not allowed to do so until the company and county agreed on an safety plan for reopening.“We are addressing this matter using the same phased approach we use for other businesses that have violated the order in the past, and we hope that Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures,” the county said in a statement.The Tesla plant has been closed since 23 March. The factory employs about 10,000 workers. On Monday, the plant’s parking lot was nearly full, prompting speculation that the company planned to defy the public health order even before Musk’s tweet.“We’re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,” an email to Tesla employees stated, according to Reuters.Tesla says it has safety procedures to protect workers including increased cleaning, enforcement of social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves where needed, installing barriers between workers when necessary and worker temperature checks at some locations.Alameda county had recorded 2,101 cases of Covid-19 and 71 deaths as of Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e9a811a74a67e0907386d3fff3c4aad4dd29b87/0_282_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17e64f8c148f4fe03fa3b5f46cd546d","title":"how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers","story":"A former deputy headteacher reveals how to ace the remote recruitment process during lockdown and hire a teacher perfect for your schoolAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4756bddd003771413a1abc4d879761ca80c2b648/0_110_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3ab9789aeaff47dce75f3432d9822e54","title":"coronavirus loud neighbors community lockdown","story":"Locked-down Americans are learning more than they ever wanted to know about their neighbors. But the disease is building socially distant bonds, tooOne day a month into quarantine, Christie was leading a Zoom board meeting of the local political club where she’s president when the floor in the unit directly above started creaking. It was just as she feared: her upstairs neighbor had decided to engage in loud intimate activities.“I just sat there waiting to see if anyone said anything,” she said from her San Diego apartment. “They couldn’t hear it. But it was so distracting and made me so anxious.”Now she’s looking fearfully ahead to the next Zoom meeting she’s slated to lead with the full club, which will feature 30 to 60 people, including elected officials. “The thought of that happening again during it scares me a lot,” she said. “I need to ask how thick the walls are next time I move.”Americans are spending more time than ever at home and that means redefining relationships with neighbors – for better and, sometimes, for worse.In cities, parties in apartment buildings that were once merely a nuisance may seem suddenly nefarious, imbued with the potential to unleash contagion. And disturbances like a baby crying or a particularly thunderous living-room dance-off can quickly drive the best-intentioned neighbors to despair.One 47-year-old mom of two in Minneapolis said a neighbor’s birthday party recently prompted her to call the police. “Seeing them all gathering, not caring about social distancing, I actually started to cry,” she said. “Each one person that doesn’t care causes a ripple effect. It’s going to be a tsunami sooner or later.”Even slovenly dress has become a point of contention in certain communities.A Maryland police department recently entreated local residents to put on pants before retrieving mail. And on NextDoor, the social media network that connects neighbors and is known as a place for petty complaints, one user asked neighbors not to leave the house in pajamas.“You don’t have to dress to the nines but please consider clean, neat casual clothes … women maybe do a bit of makeup,” a Richmond, Virginia, resident named Jerry recently wrote in a post. “Just because we are experiencing a crisis we don’t have to be slobs.”One Bay Area resident posted on Nextdoor that, after witnessing a neighbor purchasing large bags of Clorox wipes, they rooted through the trash to ensure the neighbor was throwing them away rather than flushing them down the toilet. (Evidently they were concerned for the building’s plumbing.)And coronavirus has also brought neighborly connections to new heights. Italy’s balcony singalongs have been repeated around the globe and across the country, from Boston to Indianapolis to Wichita, Kansas and San Jose, California. Residents of Marin county, California, have organized a nightly howling.Harriet Riley, a writing instructor in New Orleans, was at first distraught about the prospect of having to cancel her annual crawfish boil, a beloved Louisiana tradition. That is, until she realized there was still a way to connect.“We set up a long table at the end of our driveway with the four ice chests of crawfish,” she said, and each family had just one designated person approach. “Everyone took their crawfish to their front porches and we laughed and yelled around to each other. We also saw some neighbors that we don’t see as often. The crawfish really brought everyone out.”Such interactions mark a surprising shift. A pre-Covid report found that only about a fifth of Americans regularly spent time with their neighbors, while a third said they had never interacted with those living next door to them. It’s a steep drop from several decades ago, when a third of Americans spent time with their neighbors twice a week or more.Now even the barter economy is enjoying a boost. Sandra Choute, a special education department chair within the Maryland public school system, found herself making a deal with a neighbor in her complex who works as a nursing assistant and lacked supplies to mend a mask.“She needed needles and thread,” Choute said. “I made her a small sewing kit and she gave me gloves and masks.”Choute’s relationships with neighbors have gotten deeper, she added. Casual chit-chat from her balcony can easily turn emotional, as it did recently when a neighbor in the grass below explained how an aunt in New York was battling both cancer and Covid at once. “She’s in tears and I’m just trying to talk to her, trying to lift her spirits,” Choute recalled.It can be easy, while complaining about or praising one’s neighbors, to forget that you are also a neighbor yourself, as Hillary, a communications specialist from Cincinnati, discovered recently.“My downstairs neighbor is definitely still having hookups,” she said a few weeks ago. “Should I call the police, or … ?”But when the  circled back a week later, Hillary was in higher spirits. She and a different neighbor from down the hall had started dating.“The tables have turned,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

It said the plans “must be done in consultation with unions or workers”.Up to £14m of additional funding will be made available to help the Health and Safety Executive to police workplace practices as the economy gradually reopens. Union bosses had warned investment was vital to enforce the rules and sanction bad practices.However, the flood of papers released late on Monday warned that the guides were only “non-statutory guidance to take into account”, meaning firms would not be breaking any laws if they breached them.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said the guidance was pragmatic and would help firms to return their staff safely to work. “And as we are able to reopen new sectors of the economy, we will continue our collaborative approach, working with a wide range of stakeholders, to provide guidance for additional workplaces.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the guidelines were a step in the right direction from ministers after consultation with unions. “Getting this right is in the national interest,” she said. “If rogue employers cut corners it puts us all at risk of another spike in infections.”  She also warned that the “ government must get to grips with the ongoing crisis in PPE, as more workers start to require it.”Contactless payments and refunds, limiting the number of customers in store and keeping in-store cafes closed are among the steps retailers and banks have been advised to take.Clothing stores must consider if it’s safe to open fitting rooms, and if they do they must clean them frequently, typically between each user. They should possibly delay the return to the shopfloor of clothes that have been tried on.Customer handling of merchandise should be limited – maybe by using new displays or signage, or by rotating stock that is touched a lot. Returns to be done without contact, and items that have been brought back kept separate from other stock.Back-to-back working, rather than face-to-face, and protective screens between staff are recommended. Staff should work in fixed teams to reduce the number of people workers are in contact with.Hot desking should be avoided and more storage should be provided for bags and coats. Packaged meals could be provided to avoid opening staff canteens.Staff who usually enter through a turnstile should show a pass to security instead. Entry and exit points should be one way if possible. Desks should be cleaned and cleared at the end of shifts.Maximum occupancy in lifts should be reduced. Avoid unnecessary meetings, or hold them outside.Face masks are optional but employers must support staff who choose to wear them. Personal deliveries to the office should be restricted and contact minimised for essential deliveries, such as by pairing up the courier and recipient where goods come in frequently.Building companies must consider which staff they need on site, with support staff told to work from home where possible. Access should be restricted on building sites to encourage social distancing, while jobs and equipment rotation should also be reduced.Break times should be staggered and hand sanitiser and cleaning should be available, especially for cleaning shared tools or vehicles, such as forklift trucks and pallet trucks. Arrival times and shift patterns should also be staggered.Screens and barriers should be used where possible to separate work spaces and production lines should be reviewed to space people apart. Packaged meals should be available to avoid opening staff canteens, where possible.Pass readers at turnstiles should be deactivated in favour of showing a pass to security personnel at a distance, while alternatives should be made available for touch-based security points such as key pads.Minimising unnecessary contact at gatehouse security, yards and warehouses should be encouraged, including non-contact, pre-booked deliveries.The guidance for people working in, visiting or delivering to other people’s homes warns no work should be conducted in any households with Covid-19 symptoms or where iniduals have been asked to shield themselves – unless to remedy an urgent risk.When working in people’s homes, discussions should be held before a visit to ask that a two-metre distance be kept from those working. Avoid in-person appointments if possible.Suggested measures include working back to back, ided by protective screens. Shift patterns should be staggered and fixed working groups set up to reduce numbers in labs, with more entry and exit points made available.Use of “high-touch” equipment should be limited and equipment such as goggles washed. Air filtering systems should be installed where there is a risk of airborne particles.Kitchen access must be restricted to as few people as possible. Only one person at a time should enter walk-in fridges and pantries. Contact must be minimised at “handover” points, such as where staff pass food to delivery drivers.Customers waiting for food should wait in their cars ideally, while two-metre spaces should be demarcated where people have to queue.Laminated menus must be cleaned and paper menus disposed of. Condiments in disposable packaging are preferable.Workers should wash hands more frequently, especially before touching plates and takeaway boxes. Uniforms should be washed on site where possible. Shared delivery vehicles to be cleaned between shifts. Clear messaging, including images, should be used to inform staff who may not speak good English of the new measures.Couriers, lorry drivers and taxi drivers are all covered by this advice. Vehicles should ideally not be shared but additional safety measures should be considered if there is no other option – eg using fixed pairs of workers to share, and opening windows to increase ventilation.Employers should make sure depots are not overcrowded, and allow goods to be loaded without interaction. Alternatives to two-person deliveries, such as using mechanical equipment, should be considered. Drop-offs should be contactless.Drivers should have access to toilet facilities during their journeys and at their destinations, which could mean the employer needs to book them in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f98211fe1fd68986af3ea4da96eefd0cabe6d2/0_368_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6a283768585889039e214d00176d4ea9","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance ","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Bars, restaurants, hairdressing and beauty salons will reopen across Italy from 18 May.

This is essential,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told MEPs last week.Separately, Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron were said to be working on a deal that could allow their citizens to travel freely between the UK and France over the summer.The UK prime minister and French president were reported by the Sun newspaper to be working on a travel corridor, aimed at allowing British tourists to visit France in the summer and vice versa.Keeping the corridor open would depend on both countries maintaining a downward trend in coronavirus cases and a similar rate of contagion. The agreement would also apply to Ireland, which is part of a common travel area with the UK.The British government has exempted travellers from France from having to go into a 14-day quarantine that will apply to most international visitors. But for now citizens of both countries are being advised not to travel to holiday homes.By the peak summer season, travellers across the EU will be able to check an interactive map drawn up by the European commission’s science service that will provide information on the latest border controls and travel conditions, under the commission plans. The EU executive will also call on member states to construct preparedness plans in case of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.The commission has pledged to prioritise tourism in an EU recovery plan that is still being worked on.Meanwhile, the commission has declined to back a call by more than a dozen EU member states calling for a relaxation of passenger rights rules that would allow cash-starved airlines to reimburse people with vouchers rather than money for cancelled flights.The commission is expected to say that customers should retain the right to a cash refund, although will propose common rules for vouchers to make them as attractive as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f111326b8cf5984ab7dda9a120f66ff6b65d4c68/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d3a1b2ecd43e7f3634aedc6514bad3a","title":"france bans drinking by the seine following coronavirus lockdown ease","story":"Police statement says prefect ‘deplored’ issuing ban on alcohol consumption by river and Saint-Martin canalParisians have been banned from drinking alcohol on the banks of the Saint-Martin canal and the Seine river after police were forced to disperse crowds just hours after an eight-week coronavirus lockdown was eased.Many city dwellers stuck in flats without balconies, terraces or gardens for almost two months turned out on Monday evening to celebrate. Photos quickly circulated of unmasked revellers gathering by the water in the French capital.On the orders of the interior ministry, Paris’s police prefect issued a ban, saying it “deplored” having to do so in an indignant press release reminding everyone that the success of the déconfinement rested on “the principle of each citizen’s inidual responsibility”.“Barely a few hours after the lifting of the lockdown, dozens of people gathered … without respecting social distances and the health recommendations that have even so been hammered home for the past few weeks,” the press release said.“The prefect of police deplores the fact that, on the first day of deconfinement, he has had to take measures to prohibit the consumption of alcohol on the public highway.”The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, also expressed his displeasure, criticising the “irresponsible behaviour”. “The success of the déconfinement depends on everyone’s prudence and civic-mindedness,” he wrote on Twitter.The government has ided France into green and red areas, with Paris and three other “red” regions seeing a more limited relaxation of the rules.French police and gendarmes are going to be busy over the next three weeks despite the end of lockdown. Although the French no longer need a sworn declaration to leave their homes, a new rule is being introduced until 10 July that nobody can travel more than 100km from their main home “as the crow flies” outside their département without a “compelling” professional or family reason.This will require people who are planning a long journey to carry a new sworn declaration, giving one of seven reasons.

I just think that’s a reality of life.”The government has been criticised for the way it has handled the communication around its roadmap out of lockdown plan, with a televised address by the prime minister giving the impression people should return to work if possible from Monday. It emerged later changes are due on Wednesday.Johnson is also under fire for not announcing the strategy first in parliament.Hancock batted away suggestions the government’s messaging on the way out of lockdown had been confusing for the public, and said: “I’m here to try to make sure that everybody understands as best as possible what we’re trying to achieve. I think we were quite clear.”He said his constituents “get it” but admitted he thought it best to go on the daytime TV show in person after watching the criticism levelled at the government on Monday.Earlier he said social “bubbles” that allow for two households in England to mix should soon help with the “anguish” of not being able to see family members.In a round of broadcast interviews, he said the government had to draw a line somewhere when limiting social contact, and one-to-one meetings outdoors was a reasonable way to “protect everybody against that burgeoning into large groups of people”.He said it was sensible to limit such meetings to public places rather than private gardens, because the latter could require people to walk through one another’s houses, which was less safe.Hancock also tried to explain why childminders were being allowed to go back to work but people could not rely on their relatives for childcare. “For some people’s livelihoods they need a childminder in order to earn an income and so that is important we allow that to happen,” he said.“But at the same time we don’t want to encourage the large scale, we don’t want to encourage people, especially when grandparents are older, and we know this virus kills more older people than younger people, so we don’t want to encourage kids to stay with their grandparents, but we do want to allow people, where possible, to get back to work.”Johnson has been criticised for failing to acknowledge the pain felt by people being kept apart from their wider families, despite the guidance being very slightly changed to allow one-to-one contact between members of different households outdoors.Hancock said he understood people were upset about not being able to see relatives and partners and signalled that further loosening of the rules in the coming weeks would help to address that.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It will help if we can do it in a way that doesn’t impact on R. I think it will help with this anguish of a lot of people wanting to see family members in another household, whether that’s a grandparent – although there are the risks for older grandparents – or for people who are in a relationship but are in different households, and I understand that yearning as well.”Hancock also defended the policy of allowing people to drive to beauty spots, despite concerns about the potential for crowds to gather. He said there should not be a problem if “people socially distance when they get there, and hence we’ve kept the socially distancing rules very clearly in place”, adding: “This isn’t for people to move house or to go on holiday or to be able to stay.”There is concern about the prospect of being encouraged to go back to work from Wednesday when guidance on safety standards is only being published on Tuesday.The health secretary refused to directly answer whether people had a legal right not to go to work if they did not feel safe due to coronavirus, when twice asked on BBC Breakfast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443a50ed6bd72f311480e43f6073571881b150d4/0_111_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1db2ba23188b8744cdf1ab372daee6df","title":"uk commuters share your photos and experiences of travelling to work lockdown","story":"What it is like to travel to work at the moment?

This was because vitamin D deficiency was common among those at risk of Covid-19 (particularly older people) there was no toxic risk from taking it at the recommended dosage level, and growing evidence of benefits.Last week, scientists at Northwestern University in the US found those with severe vitamin D deficiency were twice as likely to experience Covid-19 complications.If changing advice led to a rush of products on sale in shops, “it is not a reason not to take it . . . This is no time to hang around”, she added.“While there are currently no results from randomised controlled trials to conclusively prove that vitamin D beneficially affects Covid-19 outcomes, there is strong circumstantial evidence of associations between vitamin D and the severity of Covid-19 responses, including death.”Daily sunshineIn England, Scotland and Wales, public health bodies have revised recommendations since the Covid-19 outbreak to say all adults should take at least 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily.Prof Kenny said most scientists would recommend between 800 and 1,000 IU – she takes the higher dose – and recommended older people be exposed to 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine daily, if possible.Vitamin D is produced in the skin from UVB sunlight exposure. It is changed into an active hormone that keeps the skeleton strong and free of osteoporosis. It is also contained in many foods, such as oily fish and cheese, while most people ensure they have adequate amounts through a combination of sunlight and a healthy diet.Controversially, US president Donald Trump suggested zapping the virus with sunlight or UV but this was not related to the vitamin D connection in boosting the immune system.In response to the study, a Department of Health spokeswoman said the National Public Health Emergency Team which advises the Government on Covid-19, “keeps all national and international evidence and advice under continuous review as the basis for any recommendations”.Cytokine stormsThe TCD data, produced in collaboration with Prof Jon Rhodes at the University of Liverpool, suggests it is likely to reduce serious Covid-19 complications. “This may be because vitamin D is important in regulation and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response, which causes the severe consequences of Covid-19 and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’ associated with ventilation and death,” Prof Kenny explained.Cytokine storms seem to kill a majority of Covid-19 patients, and not destruction of the lungs by the virus itself.This study shows – counterintuitively – countries at lower latitude and typically sunny countries, such as Spain and northern Italy, had low concentrations of vitamin D and high rates of deficiency. These countries also experienced the highest Covid infection and death rates in Europe.Northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland and Sweden) have higher vitamin D levels despite less UVB sunlight exposure, because supplementation and fortification of foods is more common. These countries have lower Covid infection and death rates.Vitamin D deficiency is common in Ireland and is most prevalent with age, obesity, in men, in ethnic minorities, in people with diabetes, hypertension and in nursing homes.Dr Laird said: “Optimising vitamin D intake to public health guidelines will certainly have benefits for overall health and support immune function. Research like this is still exploratory and we need further trials to have concrete evidence on the level of vitamin D that is needed for optimal immune function.“Supplementation is the best means of ensuring sufficient vitamin D blood levels. As the effects of coronavirus continue, many of us are limited in the time we can spend outdoors, so extra care is required to keep vitamin D levels healthy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Archbishop Diarmuid Martin says churches should begin \u0026lsquopreparing a detailed plan\u0026rsquoMany left comments saying they donated in remembrance of aid to Ireland during FaminePhase one of Government\u0026rsquos roadmap to reopen society is scheduled to begin on MondayGirl treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries on Monday eveningAlso, outbreak of coronavirus in Dundalk nursing home has \u0026lsquostabilised\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash managementFears of \u0026lsquosporadic outbreaks\u0026rsquo if turnaround times do not improve before people return to workProcess takes average of nine days says HSE, but experts say this must be within 72 hours to stop spread of virusTII warns of limited available funding due to prior commitments and ongoing projectsIt seems like Groundhog Day with continuing delays in Covid-19 testing and contact tracingMental Health Commission criticises \u0026lsquoinconsistencies\u0026rsquo in staff testing for Covid-19Dublin archdiocese facing mounting financial crisis with priests\u0026rsquo wages cut by a quarterFine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leaders outline commitment in letter to Labour leaderGoFundMe page set up for workers in Dhaka left stranded as company goes into liquidationUtility says HSE advice must be heeded, so people should reduce use of powerwashersCull of male and female, red and sika deer set to take place again next autumnDoctors voice concerns about spread of virus, as IMO proposes staggered changeover\u0026lsquoIf I get corona I will cough in your face\u0026rsquo: Messages express hate for soccer star\u0026rsquos family\u0026lsquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot too bad.

Photograph: Eric BaradatAFPIrish people’s generosity in helping Native Americans fight one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the United States has been described as “beyond amazing” by the Navajo Nation’s attorney general Doreen McPaul. Hundreds of thousands of dollars poured in to the Navajo \u0026amp Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund since it began to go viral in Ireland, helping it burst through its target of $1.5 million (€1.3 million) last week.The list of donors to the GoFundMe page is dominated by Irish surnames, and many donors left comments to say they were giving in remembrance of Native American aid to Ireland during the Great Hunger.In 1847, members of the Choctaw tribe raised $170 in famine relief for Ireland, a huge sum for a time when they had very little, as it came after they had been driven from their land in the devastating so-called Trail of Tears.Many comments on the GoFundMe page referenced the Choctaw donation. Some read “Ní neart go cur le chéile” and others simply “Ireland remembers”. “173 years ago, the people of the Choctaw nation showed Ireland unimaginable generosity,” wrote donor Michael Foy. “I am donating today in memory of our shared past, and to help overcome this crisis together – just as we did nearly two centuries ago.”The Nation’s attorney general Doreen McPaul who has Irish grandfathers, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Tuesday that it was “just really heart-warming” when she learned of the many donations from Irish people. “It made me want to follow up more,” she said. Both of her paternal grandfathers were Irish and her father has dual citizenship, she said. Ms McPaul has visited Ireland twice as her sister lived in Ireland while she studied international human rights.Her sister subsequently married an Irish man, from Newmarket-on-Fergus in Co Clare and they visit Ireland every summer along with her parents.The fundraiser was organised by a group of Native American women who are community organisers, and have set up a network of distribution points for food, water, and soap. The supplies are essential given that 38 per cent of people in the reservation live in poverty, and providing them helps the most vulnerable people to stay protected in their homes.The funds raised will be used to help members of the Navajo Nation which is spread across three states - Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. With a population of 170,000, to date 132 people have died from the pandemic. Communities have found coping with the virus “problematic” because of the infrastructure with many living in remote areas. Just 13 grocery stores serve an area larger than the Republic, and the Navajo estimate they have only 170 hospital beds. A third of homes do not have running water, and the legacy of US uranium mining in the territory to build its nuclear arsenal has left groundwater contaminated, making basic hygiene difficult.It is also difficult to separate an ill person from the remainder of the family as they live in multi-generational households and it was not part of the Navajo culture not to care for someone. There are also challenges with a lack of water and access to disinfectant. Ms McPaul said she first became aware of the generosity of the Irish people when the treasurer of the fund shared with her some of the comments of Irish donors. She had already been aware of the Choctaw story and of the sculpture in Ireland. “It is beyond amazing, the outpouring of support from Ireland is amazing,” she said. The Choctaw aid, which is remembered by the Kindred Spirits sculpture by Alex Pentek in Midleton, Co Cork, is not the only example of solidarity between Irish people and Native Americans in history.In a mission to drum up support for Irish independence in the US in 1919, future president Éamon de Valera was made an honorary chief by the Ojibwe-Chippewa tribe, who greeted him as “a representative of one oppressed nation to another”, according to a contemporary news report.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4250742.1589225630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse appoints investigator to assess st mary s whistleblower claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere have been 24 coronavirus-related deaths to date at St Mary’s Hospital nursing home in the  Phoenix Park. Photograph: Eric LukeSt Mary’s, located in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, is a HSE-run facility with 150 nursing home beds and a separate 48-bed step-down hospital. It has been one of the worst-hit nursing homes in the State, with 24 coronavirus-related deaths to date. Last Wednesday a staff member made a protected disclosure to the HSE, Department of Health, and Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa). It is understood the protected disclosure alleged shortcomings in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to the home, lack of testing for staff, and issues around the isolation of patients at the start of the outbreak in late March. On Monday, correspondence from the HSE sent to the whistleblower outlined an independent investigator had been appointed to assess the protected disclosure. Both the HSE and Department of Health have said they cannot comment on protected disclosures. The staff member raised serious concerns over access to PPE with senior management at the outset of the outbreak, internal correspondence shows. In an April 4th email to senior management, the staff member expressed concerns over the criteria for when healthcare workers should wear PPE, and that the process of identifying suspected coronavirus patients was “unclear”.The email stated the worker was “gravely concerned” about the lack of PPE gear, over fears staff would transmit the virus from one patient to others.In response to the outbreak, the home has put in place a series of infection-control measures. The HSE has previously said the facility currently has “adequate” supply of PPE gear, and had followed National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) guidelines at all times. Dundalk nursing homeElsewhere, a major coronavirus outbreak in a privately run nursing home in Dundalk has been contained, according to the home’s management. Dealgan House has had 23 fatalities among residents since April 1st – 22 of which were related to Covid-19. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Hospital Group had taken over the running of the home on April 17th, due to serious staffing shortages at the Co Louth facility. In a statement on Monday, an RCSI spokeswoman said the situation in the home had “stabilised” and there was “currently no further spread of Covid-19”.Staffing support provided by the hospital group had “enabled safe staffing levels for residents”, she said. There were weekly meetings to plan the safe handover of operations back to the private provider, as Dealgan House staff returned after coronavirus diagnoses or self-isolation, the spokeswoman said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4251353.1589282762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus lockdowns eased as cases exceed 4 1m worldwide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA barber wearing a face mask as restrictions to contain the coronavirus outbreak were relaxed in Singapore on May 12th, 2020. Photograph: Roslan RahmanAFP via Getty ImagesCoronavirus has infected nearly 4.2 million people and killed more than 286,500, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.Here are the latest updates on the pandemic from around the world:UKChancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme for workers as the UK death toll linked to Covid-19 passed 40,000.New analysis puts the death toll at just over 40,000, following new figures on care home deaths released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This includes deaths from Covid-19 and where it has been mentioned on the death certificate as a factor.It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the new contact tracing app will be rolled out across England shortly and Mr Sunak will set out more detailed plans for the furlough scheme.At least 6.3 million people are currently having up to 80 per cent of their salaries paid by the taxpayer under the system at a cost of some £8 billion (€9.3bn).Mr Sunak has previously said he was preparing to “wean” workers and businesses off the programme — which currently runs until the end of June — but calls have been made for it to be prolonged.It has been reported the programme will continue to September, although the rate of support will be cut from a maximum of 80 per cent of salary to 60 per cent.Mr Hancock said on Tuesday that there would be no “cliff edge” to the furlough scheme, agreeing with the suggestion that it would somehow begin to taper down.He also confirmed that the contact tracing app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would now be rolled out across England in the next week or so.He told Sky News: “We’re rolling out in mid-May. The Isle of Wight project has gone well so far, we’ve learned a lot about how the app operates.“We’re pleased with progress, and we’re going to bring it in.”- Care home deaths accounted for some 40 per cent of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending May 1st, data from the Office for National Statistics showed.- Ministers have set out guidance for commuters using public transport, saying they should keep two metres apart from others “wherever possible”, wear a face covering, use contactless payments and avoid rush-hour.- Ryanair announced plans to return to 40 per cent of normal flight schedules from July 1st.He also confirmed that when people decided to meet one other person at a distance and outdoors, they should meet in parks and open spaces, not in their gardens.He said one of the reasons is that gardens can sometimes only be accessed through a house.Mr Hancock also said the household “bubble” idea will help relieve the “anguish” of people wanting to see their grandparents or partners.The UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been asked to look at the idea of a household “bubble” in the coming weeks, where one household is allowed to join up with and interact with one other household only.Mr Hancock said it may help relieve anxiety as long as it did not impact on pushing the reproductive rate of the virus — the R — above one.SPAINSpain has reported 176 new confirmed deaths for coronavirus during the past 24 hours, bringing the country’s total death toll to 26,920. New infections confirmed by laboratory tests are up on Tuesday by 426.The total contagion, including antibody tests, stands at 269,520. The figures were slightly up from a day before, but records usually see an increase on Tuesday as unreported data over the weekend shows up in official statistics.Nearly 140,000 people have recovered after contracting the virus, Spain’s Health Ministry said.Roughly half of Spaniards are starting to enjoy a looser version of the country’s stringent lockdown adopted in mid-March.Spain will require all visitors from abroad to quarantine for 14 days if they arrive in the country after May 15th.The new Health Ministry order, published in Spain’s official gazette, said the goal is to “limit the risks derived from the international traffic of people” during the rollback of the coronavirus lockdown.Travel agencies and transport companies must inform their customers about the new regulations before they sell their Spain-bound tickets, and airlines need to make sure that passengers fill out a “location card” in case they need to be contacted after their trip.Tourism-magnet Spain is starting to loosen the grip after seven weeks of strict confinement. Authorities have reported more than 26,700 deaths for coronavirus and over 268,000 infections confirmed by tests.FRANCEFrench children have started going back to school as the country gradually lifts confinement measures, following two months of lockdown.Authorities say 86 per cent of preschools and primary schools are reopening this week. Most schools across the country start accommodating children on Tuesday. In Paris, schools will reopen on Thursday.Classes are capped at 10 students at preschools and 15 elsewhere. Students are required to keep physical distance from each other and wash their hands several times a day. Teachers must wear a mask.School attendance is not compulsory. The government has allowed parents to keep children at home amid fears prompted by the Covid-19, as France is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world. A target date has not been scheduled yet for high schools.As of Tuesday, French authorities reported nearly 140,000 people infected with the virus and more than 26,000 deaths.BELGIUMBrussels Airlines has unveiled a cost-cutting plan that will result in the reduction of 25 per cent of its workforce.The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The carrier, which also suffered from the bankruptcy of travel operator Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft as part of the restructuring.Brussels Airlines said it is losing €1million a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and maintenance costs. The company has asked the government for €290million in aid.“While the turnaround plan is indispensable to overcome the crisis, the ongoing discussions with both the Belgian government and Lufthansa remain essential,” Brussels Airlines said.GREECEPolice in northern Greece say migrants at a holding site near the country’s border with Turkey have staged violent protests following weeks of delays in processing their asylum claims due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Authorities said the protests also involved unaccompanied minors at the closed facility, which currently houses some 250 asylum seekers. No injuries were reported.The asylum service’s operations have been scaled back due to the pandemic restriction measures that have affected many public services.Greek authorities are struggling to cope with a spike in migrant crossings from Turkey, at the land border and islands, that occurred before the lockdown.DENMARKA top medical official in Denmark said “it is very unlikely that another wave of corona will occur” in the Scandinavian country.“But we may see changes in the reproduction rate,” said Kaare Moelbak, of Statens Serum Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of coronavirus in Denmark. Currently the Danish so-called reproduction rate, which measures the average number of people a person with the virus infects, is at 0.7, down from a previous 0.9.

While Boris Johnson in Westminster has decreed that playing golf can now be resumed in England, the Welsh administration in Cardiff has insisted the sport remains non-essential and illegal during the Covid-19 pandemic.So imagine the bewilderment at Llanymynech Golf Club where 15 of its holes are in Wales, two are in England and one - just to add to the chaos - begins with a tee shot in Wales and ends with a putt in England. The club is seeking advice on the legality of opening on Wednesday, fearful that Welsh authorities could fine its members, or worse still arrest them. One possibility may be for golfers to play only the two and three-quarters of holes that are located on English soil in their own version of ‘speed golf’.“We are caught in the crosshairs of two competing governments,” complained Llanymynech’s greens chairman Sandy Johnson on Monday. “We are baffled. It’s absurd. We would like to provide golf for our members who have not played for several weeks. But at the same time we don’t want to encourage them to break the law.“To be perfectly honest, it’s a very difficult dilemma for the golf club to be put in. The row between Cardiff and Westminster is not helping.”The club is just south of Oswestry in Shropshire but is mainly situated in Powys, as shown by this map:The club has been proud of its dual nationality and boasts on its website: “Drive in Wales - Putt in England. Europe’s only dual country golf course.” The course traverses Offa’s Dyke, the historic boundary between England and Wales, and while hole four, a 340-yard par four, begins in Wales with a tee shot that must negotiate a tricky dog leg left, the rest of the hole is in England. Holes five and six remain in England before a brisk walk back across the border to tee off at seven. To add to the uncertainty, the clubhouse is in Wales but the club itself is registered with England Golf, the governing body for amateur golf in England, rather than its Welsh counterpart. It is unclear if  the club’s members who live in England could drive to the course and play, while those living in Wales would risk a spot fine.On Monday afternoon, the club’s ruling committee held an emergency ‘zoom’ meeting to discuss its predicament. It will now contact legal advisers with England Golf as it seeks a solution.“We don’t want our members to get arrested,” said Mr Johnson. Asked if the club might open up the two and three-quarters of holes in England, he said that was possible and added: “I just don’t know.”The club is bemused that golf remains outlawed in Wales, pointing out the course covers 125 acres, providing adequate space for social distancing. There are 500 members and never more than 50 or 60 on the course at any one time. Sian Whiteoak, the club secretary, said Llanymynech had been gearing up to reopen as soon as Wednesday until thwarted by the ergent advice. “We could always have speed golf,” she suggested referring to the possibility of playing just the English holes.Llanymynech is renowned not only for its dual country status but also as the course where Ian Woosnam learnt to play the game. ‘Woosie’ was one of the generation of ‘Big Five’ European golfers who transformed the fortunes of golf on the Continent. Peter Alliss, 89, for a long time the BBC’s ‘voice of golf’, suggested Llanymynech’s golfers could play the three holes that are in England six times to circumvent the Welsh rules. “It’s ridiculous,” he said on Monday, adding: “Well it would be hilarious if it wasn’t for the fact this virus is quite so serious.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clergy start streaming services churches week archbishop designate","story":"For almost two months, places of worship and religious buildings have remain closed under the lockdown rules in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. Even when we do return to the sacred, beautiful space of our church buildings, with all their vital and much-missed resonances of continuity, I believe the Church of England will emerge from this stronger than it has been for a long while, he said.It is not one thing or the other.

With “Take back control” and “Get Brexit done” they have driven home devastatingly simple messages to historic effect. Anyone with political experience can testify to the power of deploying a few words to sum up a popular cause. The one time I defeated Tony Blair was in the European elections of 1999, endlessly repeating “In Europe, not run by Europe”, then considered the outer limit of euroscepticism. Yet such slogans also have their limitations, particularly when the simplicities of campaigning are succeeded by the complexities of governing. They are designed for a specific, one-off and time-limited purpose: to get people to vote a particular way on one day of their lives with one issue in mind. They are not suited, however, to conveying complex responsibilities or dealing with changing circumstances. Slogans don’t work if you have to change them repeatedly, endlessly explain them, or if different versions are employed at the same time. Such drawbacks in trying to keep a message simple over time are contributing to the difficulties now facing Downing Street. The original “Stay home” message was straightforward and direct. It arguably led to more people staying at home than was expected or necessary, for instance on construction sites that initially closed and then reopened within the same rules. But a blunt instrument was justified in creating sufficient shock and impact to be sure of saving the NHS from disaster. Unfortunately, the more successful a slogan, the harder it is to change it. Imagine if, during the referendum, “Take back control” had been amended to “Take back a bit of influence”. Accusations of confusion and softening of the message become easy to fling. People who had nothing to do with coming up with the original message feel genuinely aggrieved at not being asked about changing it – Cabinet ministers, MPs and devolved governments alike. Indeed, for the Scottish and Welsh governments, led by opposition parties with a political incentive to differentiate themselves from decisions in London, arguments about a slogan offer them an easy line of attack. Nicola Sturgeon can make much of not knowing what “Stay alert” means, rather than having to justify, for example, why people cannot play golf in Scotland while others will do so, perfectly safely, in England. But the biggest problem of all with reducing government communication to a few words from this point on, is that we are about to embark on the most complicated national and global challenge since those remarkable scenes on VE Day in 1945. Almost every person in the country will have to change their behaviour every few weeks, but they may have to change it back again. Furthermore, what they need to do will be different from the person next door with a different type of job, or with children of a different age, or with their own transport, or who has already had the virus, or needs medical care for something unrelated to Covid-19. The economic and business complexities, as the Chancellor restricts and tapers the furlough schemes, and office workers take turns to work at the office or from home, will become much greater. The rules of international travel and tourism will vary greatly, with a new and shifting map of the world showing the bubbles and corridors within which we can move, while being quarantined if returning from the rest. I hope no one in government is seriously thinking of adjusting a slogan every few weeks to try to cope with such complexity. Even when the words are sensible enough, like “Stay alert”, each change will be the subject of increasing controversy and misrepresentation. A slogan is required when it is necessary to get people’s attention or to cut through the news among other distractions. None of that is needed now: we are all concentrating and not talking about much else. We have reached one of those rare points in history when the public has a real appetite for extensive information. They know full well that what we all have to do next cannot be boiled down to a few words. This has major implications for how ministers should present their approach. I make no criticism of Mr Johnson for his broadcast on Sunday evening – he spoke well and clearly, the direction he set was right, and the immediate decisions justified. But he would be well advised in future to present a detailed statement to Parliament first, with the accompanying documents and detail, and then address the nation. Then there would be far fewer opportunities for critics to jump on the absence of detail, or for the media to have to rely on briefings about the implications. Lifting lockdown around the world, in picturesThe same is true of the many announcements that will need to be made in the coming weeks from almost every government department as rules are changed for businesses, schools, travel and leisure. Showing people that each change is well-thought out, carefully judged, with risks duly weighed, is in itself a key part of the reassurance that they need to venture out again. The more measures are presented in Parliament, debated for hours, with detailed scrutiny, the better for public confidence. It could not be more different from an election campaign. Won’t we all get lost in a morass of detail this way? No: Boris rightly announced a new five-tier system for the severity of the pandemic. He explained we have been at level four and are trying to go down to three. If this is to be the framework to guide government decisions from now on, it is surely also the opportunity to explain to the public what restrictions they can expect at each level, in this crisis and any future pandemic. At the end of this crisis, it will probably turn out that we and other Western nations have things to learn from Germany. The death rate there has been considerably lower than in France, Italy, Spain or Britain, and they are making progress in emerging from their lockdown. But they tend to eschew the simple slogan as they work their way through the slow lifting of some controls. The day of the all-encompassing slogan in this crisis is over. The day of the rather long and painstaking explanation has dawned.  Coronavirus latest news: Summer holidays \u0026#39very likely\u0026#39 to be cancelled, Matt Hancock admitsWatch live as Rishi Sunak updates MPs on furlough scheme as firms prepare for return to workWatch: Witness of Ahmaud Arbery killing says he\u0026#39s receiving death threatsWatch: How to make a no-sew, government-approved cloth face mask Spain to quarantine all international visitors for two weeks to counter threat of new Covid-19 casesAfghan commandos rescue 80 children and their mothers as gunmen attack maternity hospitalComment: To futureproof the NHS, the government must turbo-charge innovation  These are the health workers who have died from coronavirusSpanish police trap parrot-stealing gang in complicated sting operationComment: Boris Johnson was left struggling under Keir Starmer\u0026#39s detailed and fair scrutinyFive Covid-19 patients die in Russia as ventilator short-circuits and catches fireWhen will UK lockdown end?

South Africa’s president won office because he was seen as moderate and business friendly, a level head and soothing hand after nearly a decade of shrill populism under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma.Fixing the rotten legacy he inherited would always be a daunting challenge. Since he took the oath of office in February, 2018, South Africa has twice slipped into recession as the years of waste, corruption and ineptitude took their toll.Even before the country’s first confirmed case was reported in KwaZulu Natal in early March, South Africa’s economy was shrinking, its people getting poorer.But now, five weeks into one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, Africa’s most developed state is facing the prospect of unparalleled financial upheaval.By one measure, the restrictions Mr Ramaphosa has imposed, from a ban on alcohol and cigarette sales to a prohibition on dog walking, have been impressively successful.South Africa might have the largest number of cases on the continent — 9,420 in total, with 186 deaths — but it started to flatten the curve of its infection rate in the last week of March.In fact, the overall death rate has actually fallen: in a notoriously violent country, the lockdown has meant that South Africans have had fewer opportunities to murder each other, while the prohibition on booze meant there has been less drink-driving.Yet if one catastrophe may have been averted, another is looming, and a growing number of voices are suggesting that the lockdown might not be worth it — that it could even cost more lives than it saves.“There is very little for us to gain and almost everything to lose by keeping people at home and keeping businesses shut any longer,” John Steenhuisen, the interim leader of South Africa’s Democratic Alliance opposition, said in a speech on Friday.Mr Ramaphosa has authorised a phased easing of the lockdown. Some employees in selected manufacturing industries are being allowed back to work under strict conditions.But most restrictions remain in place and many South Africans, anxious about their survival, are starting to chafe against them.South Africa may be the world’s most economically unequal state, but the lockdown has brought misery across the race and class ide and Mr Steenhuisen’s criticism is starting to resonate throughout society.For although the president has unveiled what is by far Africa’s biggest stimulus and social relief programme — worth 500bn rand (£22bn) and equivalent to 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product — its delivery has been patchy at best.The state has only been able to reach a fraction of those South Africans who need food aid. Most are being fed by private charities.Even the private charities face being overwhelmed. On April 29, donors from local businesses and mosques set up stalls to deliver 8,000 food parcels to residents of two townships near Johannesburg. Within an hour, a two-mile queue had formed.Florence Malope, a resident of Alexandra, one of the oldest of Johannesburg’s townships, is among those who has registered to receive food aid from the provincial government. So far none has been forthcoming.A cleaner, she is still just about to make ends meet because an employer she works for one day a week is still paying her, even though she cannot actually report for duty. Many of her neighbours, however, are far worse off.“I see people every day, including children, going to bed at night without eating,” she said. “Some are starving.”More than 700,000 people live in “Alex”, a 2.7 sq mile patch of squalor across the highway from Sandton City, the richest square mile in Africa. At least a third of the country’s population of 58m still live in similar townships and squatter camps.Many of them are desperate. Before the lockdown, school-going children could at least count on being given a decent meal a day. But with schools closed, many families now have less to eat and more mouths to feed.And the problem is only likely to grow. Economic modelling conducted by the World Bank and others calculates that more Africans are likely to enter poverty than escape it for the first time in decades.South Africa will not be an exemption. The country’s treasury estimates that as many as 7m will lose their jobs.The country’s economic picture could not be grimmer. Last month, the rand fell to a record low against the dollar and South Africa’s credit rating was downgraded to junk status.Some of the country\u0027s most famous companies seem unlikely to survive. South African Airways, the continent’s oldest airline, has entered bankruptcy protection and is seeking to lay off all its staff. It is almost certainly doomed.More than half of the country’s magazine titles, some of which have been in publication for more than 50 years, have gone under in the past fortnight.With no visitors entering South Africa, the tourism sector, from hotels in the Cape to safari lodges in the Kruger National Park, has been ravaged.Even South African Breweries, one of the country’s most successful firms, is in crisis. Last week it announced it would have to dump 34 million gallons of beer, literally throwing it down the drain, because of the ban on alcohol sales.Ultimately, analysts say, the economic devastation will cost not just livelihoods but also lives — with some predicting the economy could shrink by as much as 17 percent, a decline of similar severity to that witnessed in the United States during the Great Depression.“The recession is going to be much deeper than we thought and is going to endure much longer,” said Martin Kingston, head of the economic workgroup at Business for South Africa, which represents some of the country’s biggest companies.“A continued lockdown is not only damaging the economy. It promises a humanitarian disaster to dwarf Covid-19.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 12th may 2020","story":"Coronavirus latest news: Summer holidays \u0026#39very likely\u0026#39 to be cancelled, Matt Hancock admitsWatch live as Rishi Sunak updates MPs on furlough scheme as firms prepare for return to workWatch: Witness of Ahmaud Arbery killing says he\u0026#39s receiving death threatsWatch: How to make a no-sew, government-approved cloth face mask Spain to quarantine all international visitors for two weeks to counter threat of new Covid-19 casesAfghan commandos rescue 80 children and their mothers as gunmen attack maternity hospitalComment: To futureproof the NHS, the government must turbo-charge innovation  These are the health workers who have died from coronavirusSpanish police trap parrot-stealing gang in complicated sting operationComment: Boris Johnson was left struggling under Keir Starmer\u0026#39s detailed and fair scrutinyFive Covid-19 patients die in Russia as ventilator short-circuits and catches fireWhen will UK lockdown end?

It means not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions.In his public address on Sunday, the Prime Minister urged members of the public to “avoid public transport if at all possible” because of the need to maintain social distancing, and as a result of this, capacity on public transport will therefore be limited. The Prime Minister added that public transport operators will be following “Covid-secure standards”.He also urged those who must go to work to get to work by walking or bicycle where possible. The Government will increase funding and provide new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, create pop-up cycle lanes, and close some roads in cities to traffic (apart from buses) as some councils are already proposing.Social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously. He said the Government was working with tech firms to develop apps to allow people to “find out what parts of the transport network are overcrowded and avoid them” to maintain social distancing after lockdown. The Government will be managing the risk of transmissions from abroad, in order to keep overall levels of infection down. First, the Government will require all international arrivals to disclose information about their contact and accommodation. They will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app.Second, the Government will require all international arrivals not on a short list of exemptions to self-isolate in their accommodation for fourteen days on arrival into the UK. Where international travellers are unable to demonstrate where they would self-isolate, they will be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the Government.The Government is working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate implementation across the UK. Small exemptions to these measures will be in place to provide for continued security of supply into the UK.International travel measures will not come into force on 13 May but will be introduced as soon as possible. One of the most significant changes announced by the Prime Minister has been who the Government believes should now be going to work. Previously, guidance was that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you absolutely must. However, Mr Johnson has now said that anyone who can’t work from home - for instance those working in construction or manufacturing - should be “actively encouraged to go to work”. The Prime Minister has said that in order to ensure workplaces are safe, the Government has been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces “Covid-19 secure”.The Government has been consulting the relevant sectors, unions and authorities, including Public Health England, to develop new safety guidelines that can be adapted for workplaces to operate safely, and will release guidelines this week.It will also include measures that were unlikely to be effective when the virus was so widespread that full stay-at-home measures were required, but that may now have some effect as the public increase the number of social contacts.The Government will need to continue to ask all employers and operators of communal spaces to be innovative in developing novel approaches UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will welcome grant applications for proposals to develop new technologies and approaches that help the UK mitigate the impact of this virus.Other recommendations include installing plexiglass screens between desks in offices and requiring workers not to sit face-to-face but back-to-back or side-to-side, lifts only being used if half-empty, hot-desking abolished and workers not sharing equipment.Staggered arrival and departure times for employees are also being considered, as well as providing staff with packaged meals to avoid opening canteens.The drafted social distancing guidance remains quite stringent for non-office workers. For example, guidance for couriers and lorry drivers suggests finding alternatives to two-person delivery, and building sites and farms should be separated into “zones” of different worker groups with staggered break times.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan test entire population 11m uptick cases prompts alarm","story":"The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, plans to conduct city-wide nucleic acid testing over a period of 10 days, according to an internal document seen by Reuters and two sources familiar with the situation.Every district in the city has been told to submit a detailed testing plan by Tuesday for their respective area, the document showed.These plans come as global alarm was sounded on Monday over a potential second wave of coronavirus infections after Germany reported that the reproduction rate of the pathogen had risen above 1.Wuhan reported its first cluster of coronavirus infections since a lockdown on the city, the epicentre of the outbreak in China, was lifted a month ago, stoking concerns of a wider resurgence.The five new confirmed cases, all from the same residential compound, come amid efforts to ease restrictions across China as businesses restart and iniduals get back to work.We must resolutely contain the risk of a rebound, the health authority in Wuhan, a city with a population of about 11 million, said in a statement on Monday.All of the latest cases in Wuhan were previously classified as asymptomatic - people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs.Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released on April 8 from a months-long lockdown, are being monitored.On average, the city has conducted about 47,000 nucleic acid tests each day since the lockdown was lifted, Reuters calculations based on reports by Wuhan\u0027s health authority show.China does not include asymptomatic cases in its overall tally of confirmed cases, now at 82,918, until they exhibit signs of infection. Mainland China has reported 4,633 deaths.New confirmed cases reported in China since April have been low compared with the thousands every day in February, thanks to a nationwide regime of screening, testing and quarantine.And Beijing said on Friday that cinemas, museums and other venues would gradually be reopened, though restrictions including mandatory reservations and a limit on numbers of visitors would be in place.Despite fears of a second wave of the virus, some Shanghai night spots are open again and Walt Disney Co reopened its Shanghai Disneyland park to a reduced number of visitors.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/bitcoin-mining-russia.jpg","title":"bitcoin halving price value cryptocurrency latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Previous events preceded record price runs, though its value\u0026nbspremains a long way off its\u0026nbspall-time highBitcoin has passed its momentous ‘halving’ event, marking the third time in its history that the\u0026nbsprate of producing new units of the cryptocurrency is cut in half.At 8.23pm UK time, the 630,000th block of bitcoins was digitally mined, triggering the pre-programmed event that had been highly anticipated by the cryptocurrency industry due its impact on the price.Blocks of bitcoin will now contain only 6.25 units, rather than 12.5, when they are mined – the process of generating the cryptocurrency through powerful computers programmed to solve complex mathematical puzzles.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe halving is programmed to take place roughly every four years and is designed as an anti-inflationary measure to ensure the scarcity of bitcoin.More than 18 million bitcoins have been mined since its inception in 2009, however the halving events mean that it will take until the year 2140 for all 21 million bitcoins to be mined.Previous halving events have preceded record price surges, resulting in predictions from market analysts that another bull run is imminent.Bitcoin’s current price of $8,787 remains a long way off its $20,000 high, which it reached in 2017.“Previous bitcoin halving events have prompted impressive price climbs. The 2016 halving triggered a 300 per cent\u0026nbspjump in the value of bitcoin,” Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy firm deVere, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“There is no reason to believe this time the market will not respond with a longer-term upward trajectory. Indeed, the rally which is likely on its way could potentially be even more dramatic because there is more mass awareness than ever before of the long-term use of and need for digital currencies.”Other analysts remain cautious about how much of an impact the halving event will actually have on the cryptocurrency market.The introduction of futures markets in bitcoin in late 2017 means that such significant price surges are less likely to happen, according to Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.“Some estimates have the price of bitcoin doubling, or increasing by even more with estimates of up to $50,000. However there are good reasons to believe this is a vast overstatement of the true fundamentals of the bitcoin price,” he said.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

It helps employers. And, that\u0027s what the government should actually be providing.Who is encouraged to return to work?Employment lawyers warned that the government\u0027s new message of return to work if you cannot work from home is likely to bring employers and workers\u0026nbspinto conflict.Employees may be rightly concerned for their own health and safety as well as that of their co-workers and others in their household, said Dan Hobbs, an employment barrister at 5 Essex Court.Workers\u0026nbsphave a legal right not to be subjected to detriment because they have raised a legitimate health and safety concern such as the lack of personal protective equipment.Mr Hobbs added: Accordingly, if an employee walks out of the workplace or refuses to return to the workplace in circumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believes to be serious and imminent, the employee cannot be subjected to a detriment by his employer as a result.If an employer were to take disciplinary action or withhold pay because the employee has raised a relevant health and safety concern, they could face proceedings in the Employment Tribunal. Employees who are dismissed could bring a claim for unfair dismissal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The fall was the steepest on record and worse than any of\u0026nbsp the 18 forecasts collected by Reuters.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 30,000 deaths. Provisional figures suggest Italy’s GDP contracted 4.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesItaly was one of the first to be hit by Covid-19, with soaring death rates leading to a nationwide lockdown imposed from 10 March and all non-essential production being shut down since 22 March.Industrial production is likely to have fallen even further in April, with economists forecasting a 50 per cent decline on the same month last year.Industrial production plunged across the board in March, Istat said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down.“The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March,” Oxford Economics said in a note. The decline hit all sectors, “but the 50 percent drop in transport equipment was just astonishing”, it said.The government forecasts GDP will contract by 8 per cent this year, with other economists predicting a steeper decline of closer to 13 per cent.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastPrime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday he may announce a further easing of\u0026nbspItaly’s lockdown earlier than planned.Mr Conte told newspaper Corriere della Sera that ahead he sees “a sharp fall in GDP and the economic consequences will be very painful”.Italy partially eased its strict lockdown conditions last week, allowing manufacturing and construction companies to start back up.Shops are due to re-open on 18 May, with bars, restaurants and barbers to start operating on 1 June.“We’re gathering the data from the latest monitoring and with the experts we’re defining clear safety rules for workers and customers,” Mr Conte said. “If the situation remains under control on the epidemiological level, we’ll be able to agree some earlier moves with the regions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anyone else in the house can then scan that code and join the same session.As well as being able to add tracks, anyone in the session can use Spotify\u0027s playback controls to skip forward or back, or play and pause.All of the people using the feature must have a paid, premium Spotify account. Though it can support as many as 100 people, they must all be in the same physical space.The tool is rolling out now and in beta form, meaning not all users may have access to it.

Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important.“Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home.”Asked for a second time whether people are protected by law if they felt unsafe in the workplace, the health secretary\u0026nbspsaid: “Well, employment law has not changed, but that isn’t the point.“The point is that businesses and employees should be working together to make the best of a very difficult situation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But social distancing of some kind is going to continue,” Mr Hancock said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?Until now, some ministers have only said that they, personally, are not making any holiday plans, without setting out what the impact on the public is likely to be.Under the cautious lockdown easing, hospitality must wait for the third phase – no earlier than 4 July – to learn if it can return to some kind of normality.But Boris Johnson made clear it would only happen if coronavirus cases continued to be driven down and there was no evidence of a the much-feared second peak.Meanwhile, the UK – and Spain, amongst other countries – are planning strict quarantine rules for international arrivals, which will cripple the tourism industry it is feared.Airlines and tour operators were hoping that “Project Lift-off” would get under way in late June, in time for the two main holiday months of July and August.But the UK government’s proposed quarantine measures are likely to deter millions of British holidaymakers, as they will require 14 days of self-isolation for most people returning to the UK.In addition, a tangle of other restrictions apply abroad – with Spain abruptly announcing a temporary two-week quarantine rule for arriving visitors from Friday.The comments come after Mr Hancock drew criticism for arguing efforts to defeat Covid-19 in care homes had been a success, compared with other countries.He also dismissed claims that the public was bamboozled by a shambolic announcement of the lockdown changes from Sunday evening.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It includes tests that were posted out.\u0026nbspWe’re told 31,587 people have died. No they haven’t. It’s far more than that.”The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: “I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It’s such a missed opportunity. There’s a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they’re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10’s communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what’s going on.”He added: “I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.”When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Well, I’m sure there’s ways we can improve these press conferences.“They continue to get large audiences, but they’re designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers – and I very strongly respect the professor – if we can do that, we should and will do that.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMinisters have cited the views of Professor\u0026nbspSpiegelhalter a number of times during the pandemic.When questioned about the death toll by Labour leader Keir Starmer during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday last week, Boris Johnson said: “I would echo what we’ve heard from Professor David Spiegelhalter and others: that at this stage, I don’t think that international comparisons and the data is yet there to draw all the conclusions that we want.”The message the government is putting out to the public on the pandemic has also been criticised by another member of Sage, behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie who said dropping the “stay home” slogan risked giving people the green light to socialise, jeopardising the gains made by the coronavirus lockdown in.Prof Michie said Mr Johnson\u0027s new messaging was “a long way” from being clear and consistent, adding: “This could potentially undermine the good work over the last few weeks that has seen impressively sustained high levels of adherence by the public in what for many are very challenging situations.”It comes as the prime minister is expected to unveil a new colour-coded alert system as he eases some lockdown restrictions in Sunday night’s daily briefing. It is thought he is going\u0026nbspto drop the government’s “stay at home” messaging in favour of “stay alert” – sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because its advice is not published it cannot be subjected to scientific challenge”.Had Sage’s advice been published in January, he said, “an army of scientists from our universities could have challenged why testing and contact tracing was not being modelled. They could have demanded a ramp up of testing and challenged the behavioural assumptions that delayed lockdown”.The result could have been “many lives saved” he said.Ministers insist they have followed the science amid signs of increasing tension between ministers and advisers over how to fight the global pandemic and protect the economy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Bavaria, zoos, museums and libraries have been given the green light to reopen with strict social distancing in place.This follows the earlier reopening of shops, playgrounds, museums, and churches across the country, along with secondary schools only.However, with responsibility for education devolved to Germany’s 16 federal states, some have been moving quicker than others. In Bavaria, one of the country’s worst-hit regions, school openings had been delayed until Monday.To reduce the risk of transmission, class sizes have been cut in half, one-way systems enforced in corridors, and lunch breaks staggered.Masks and gloves have even been handed out among staff and students at some schools, such as the ISR International School on the Rhine, near Dusseldorf.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEileen Lyons, the school\u0027s director, told The Independent that students have also had the opportunity to “choose between virtual classes or physical classes at ISR since 9 March, depending on the level of risk of the students and families”.“This has allowed us to provide continuous lessons from kindergarten through to grade 12,” she added.The green light has also been given for the return of the Bundesliga, Germany’s top football league, which is due to restart next weekend – despite the recent positive tests recorded among Dynamo Dresden’s squad.Germany\u0027s chancellor, Angela Merkel, emphasised that people needed to continue to maintain social distancing despite the changes.It\u0027s very important to me to again draw attention to the fact that we\u0027re entering a new phase of the pandemic and that it will now be necessary, with all the easing of measures, to be sure that people stick to the basic rules ie keeping their distance, wearing mouth and nose protection and showing consideration for each other, Ms Merkel told reporters.The easing of restrictions has been accompanied by nationwide calls for the accelerated lifting of containment measures.On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered in a number of major German cities, including Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart and Berlin, where about 30 people were arrested outside the Reichstag for not obeying social distancing measures.Despite the growing pressure to reopen\u0026nbspsociety, with many of the federal states eager to return to some degree of normality, questions continue to persist over the country’s current course of action, which appears to have sparked a recent\u0026nbspspike in cases.More than 1,250 new confirmed cases were reported on Saturday, many of which were linked to outbreaks in slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Before the lockdown was eased, the number of daily cases had fallen below the 1,000 mark.Many of the 205 people infected in a meat plant in Coesfeld, a city in NRW, were migrant workers from eastern Europe living in shared accommodation. NRW\u0027s health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, said that an estimated 17,000-20,000 employees in all of the state’s 35 slaughterhouses would be tested for the coronavirus, including\u0026nbspall 1,200 workers at the Coesfeld plant.While many have called for greater action in relaxing restrictions, others have criticised the government for moving too quickly.Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat lawmaker and professor of epidemiology, has warned that Covid-19 could start spreading again quickly after seeing large crowds out and about on Saturday in his home city of Cologne.“It has to be expected that the R rate will go over 1 and we will return to exponential growth,” Prof Lauterbach said in a tweet. “The loosening measures were far too poorly prepared.”To help contain any future coronavirus clusters, Ms Merkel last week unveiled an “emergency brake” which will require local authorities to reimpose restrictions if the numbers of cases rise above a threshold of 50 per 100,000 people.In recent days, five areas have broken the threshold, including the southern town of Rosenheim, where a number of cases were found in a refugee shelter. It was not immediately clear whether officials would reimpose restrictions across the town or limit measures to the affected asylum centre.Although much has been made of Germany’s rising R rate, the RKI has also warned against jumping to conclusions.The institute said that because of the fluctuations in statistics it could not yet be assessed “whether the trend of new infections, which has been falling in recent weeks, has continued or whether the number of cases has increased again”.The RKI also warned last month\u0026nbspthat the dynamics of the\u0026nbsppandemic should not be judged on the R rate alone. It is an “important factor” but “only one measure among many”, said RKI\u0027s president, Lothar Wieler.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I put up my hand and thought I’d see him in a couple of hours.Well I did, but he wasn’t alive the next time I got to...Charlotte and Tim appeared on Good Morning Britain on May , , following the announcement of the Red Notice - describing it as very emotional.Tim said: For me it came out of the blue, I wasn’t expecting it at all.My understanding is she is now a wanted fugitiveshe leaves America.She can be arrested and sent back to the UK to stand trial. So, it’s a massive step for us as a family.It’s been a really hard time this lockdown. You have more time to think so you reflect on stuff, so it makes it harder.This news is great. I’m sure it’s going to be helping us down the line. It’s a good thing.”Breaking down as he talked about lockdown further, Tim added: “It’s a struggle, it really is a struggle.”Charlotte went on: [It’s] pretty rough most days, I’ve got to be honest. It’s a very emotional time as it is but to be in lockdown again, because we voluntarily went into lockdown really after losing Harry.We had only sort of got our lives back for a little time, for a matter of weeks, when the coronavirus hit. So, we are struggling.”Fighting back tears herself, she added: “You can’t offload to anybody each day because you can’t see them… to not have those hugs and those cuddles that you really need at a time like this is far, far more dficult than I even thought it would ever be at the beginning, I’ve got to be honest.”Speaking about the Red Notice, Charlotte said: She should never have gone back to the US in the first place.But the one major thing for me that came of this, when I read the Interpol notice, it encourages us and confirms to us that the UK authorities are finally on the same page as us, because they cannot issue a red Interpol notice to anybody, to anyone who was or is covered by diplomatic immunity.So that gives us confidence that finally after the eight months of the nine after losing Harry, and the fighting we have done, that the UK authorities are clearly on the same page as us to have taken the decision to put that red Interpol notice out.The devastated parents also appeared on This Morning on October , , after landing from the meeting President Trump.The grieving pair said they just wanted the truth over their sons death.Charlotte made an appeal to Ms Sacoolas and said: Just get on the plane and come back to the UK.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage. There is a feeling of national unity now that I have never known in my letime.From the courage of NHS workers to the kindness of neighbours, we have witnessed the best of our people during this crisis.The sick man of Europe  Not us.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, this is not a rule and the science is complex.The key thing is to not be too close to people for more than a short amount of time, as much as you can.Keep your hands and face as clean as possible. Wash your hands often using soap and water, and dry them thoroughly.Use sanitiser where available outside your home, especially as you enter a building and after you have had contact with surfaces. Avoid touching your face.. Wet your hands with water. Apply enough soap to cover your hands. Rub your hands together. Use one hand to rub the back of the other hand and clean in between the fingers. Repeat with other hand. Rub your hands together and clean in between your fingers. Rub the back of your fingers against your palms. Rub your thumb using your other hand. Do the same with the other thumb. Rub the tips of your fingers on the palm of your other hand. Repeat with the other hand. Rinse your hands with water. Dry your hands completely with a disposable towel. Use the disposable towel to turn off the tapWork from homeyou can. Many people can do most or all of their work from home, with the proper equipment and adjustments.Your employer should support you to find reasonable adjustments to do this. However, not all jobs can be done from home.If your workplace is open and you cannot work from home, you can travel to work.Avoid being face to face with peoplethey are outside your household.You are at higher risk of being directly exposed to respiratory droplets released by someone talking or coughing when you are within m of someone and have face-to-face contact with them.You can lower the risk of infectionyou stay side-to-side rather than facing people.Reduce the number of people you spend time with in a work setting where you can.You can lower the risks of transmission in the workplace by reducing the number of people you come into contact with regularly, which your employer can support where practical by changing sht patterns and rotas to match you with the same team each time and splitting people into smaller, contained teams.You can lower the risks of transmission by reducing the number of people you come into close contact with, so avoid peak travel times on public transport where possible, for example.Businesses should take reasonable steps to avoid people being gathered together, for example by allowing the use of more entrances and exits and staggering entry and exit where possible.If you have to travelthink about how and when you travel.To reduce demand on the public transport network, you should walk or cycle wherever possible. If you have to use public transport, you should try and avoid peak times.Employers should consider staggering working hours and expanding bicycle storage facilities, changing facilities and car parking to help.Wash your clothes regularly. There is some evidence that the virus can stay on fabrics for a few days, although usually it is shorter, soyou are working with people outside your household wash your clothes regularly.Changing clothes in workplaces should only normally be considered where there is a high risk of infection or there are highly vulnerable people, such as in a care home.If you need to change your clothes avoid crowding into a changing room.Here, Laundryheap CEO Deyan Dimitrov shares his top tips on how to wash your clothes to ensure you banish Covid-.. The hotter the betterOur core body temperature runs at an average of C, and provides the ideal conditions for bacteria and viruses to thrive.This meansyou’re looking to fight off the dreaded coronavirus, the much revered C wash might not always pack the punch needed.Most viruses won’t survive in temperatures over C, so you could opt for this setting items that are particularly germ ridden and washed less often, like tea towels, bedding, bath towels, gloves, scarves, and children’s clothing.. Take extra stepsExtreme heat and freezing temperatures can stop bacteria from multiplying, soyou’re doing laundry, take the extra steps and throw your washed items into the tumble drier for  minutes for some added heat and germ killing action.Equally,you’re looking for the motivation to iron, this is it! Iron temperatures can reach over C - not much can survive that.. Clean machinesWashing machines are criminally neglected from our cleaning agendas.But once you realise just how much dirt and grime these machines can harbour, you won’t be taking the risk again.Avoid contaminating your clothes with the machine itself by pouring a cup of white vinegar directly into the drum and starting a hot wash cycle of at least C.Try this every month to avoid any build up of soap, mould and bacteria.. Get the formula rightToo much detergent will create extra soap suds which will cling to your laundry and trap dirt there, rather than lt it away.Similarly, an excess of suds will only create further build-up of soap scum in your machine.Instead, opt for the recommended dosage, and when it comes to fabric softener, try giving white vinegar a go instead of chemical alternatives.. Disinfect effectivelyWhen someone in the home has been poorly, be sure to disinfect quickly and effectively.Handle all bedding and clothing with rubber gloves and wash straight away - never leave to sit in a hamper!Keep indoor places well ventilated. Evidence suggests that the virus is less likely to be passed on in well-ventilated buildings and outdoors.In good weather, try to leave windows and doors open in places where people from dferent households come into contact – or move activity outdoorsyou can.Use external extractor fans to keep spaces well ventilated and make sure that ventilation systems are set to maximise the fresh air flow rate.Heating and cooling systems can be used at their normal temperature settings.If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet.This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example on public transport or in some shops.The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect othersyou are infected but have not developed symptoms.If you have symptoms of Covid-you and your household should isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this.A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers these supplies should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards.Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary school age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.You should follow the advice given to you by your employer when at work.Employers have a duty to assess and manage risks to your safety in the workplace. The Government has issued guidance to help them do this.This includes how to make adjustments to your workplace to help you maintain social distance.It also includes guidance on hygiene as evidence suggests that the virus can exist for up to  hours on surfaces.Frequent cleaning is therefore particularly important for communal surfaces like door handles or lt buttons and communal areas like bathrooms, kitchens and tea points.You can see the guidance on GOV.UK and can ask your employeryou have questions.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.As well as the simple four step face mask , the government also issued guidance on how to make a sewn face covering.In order to make that you will need a needle and thread, scissors, two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and two cm pieces of elastic .This process is a little more complicated but can also be completed in just four steps...Step one: Taking your fabric cut out two cm x cm squares of cotton fabric and then stack the two squares on top of each other.Step two: Fold over one side by   cm and hem, then do the same on the opposite side. Make two channels by folding the double layer of fabric over .cm along each side and stitching this down.Step three: Now for the tricky part, you need to run a cmof elastic, string or cloth strip through the wider hem on each side of the face covering. These will be used as the ear loops and you can use a large needle to thread this through.Step four: Pull on the elastic and adjust the fabric so it fits well across your face.

It also stated that the coverings do not need to be worn in schools for children who are still attending.Health Minister Jo Churchill said the strategy has been guided by the science and that thanks to updated advice today, people should consider wearing the masks in public spaces where social distancing is not possible.You do not need a clinical mask which are prioritised for our healthcare workers.Instead a face covering is sufficient and we encourage people to make these at home with items they will already own, she added.This is while Professor Chris Whitty said the face coverings were just added precautions and highlighted that the most effective way to protect yourself from the virus was to stay at home.Previous guidance from the World Health Organisation has stated that when people had worn face masks for prolonged periods of time, they were more likely to put others at risk by not strictly following other hygiene standards such as hand washing and social distancing.When issuing the guidance on face covering making, the government highlighted that it did no endorse any particular way of mask making and that children should be supervised at all timesmaking the masks at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are very limited places to eat, other than takeaways.We do not believe that this is staying alert - to undertake a long, unnecessary journey.At this time we ask you to stay away, and in the comfort of your own home, plan a future break to Cornwall when it is safe to do so.The bottom line though is that we dont want people turning up in Cornwall on Wednesday.Nancy Platts, leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, said: We want a slow, steady and safe progression towards lockdown lting.The council released a statement, saying: We want to make sure we are stepping forward in a measured way. We know restrictions will need to stay in place for a long time to come.We want the restrictions to be lted carefully in a positive direction. Our priority is to keep people who live in the city safe. One concern is around how residents can maintain physical distancing in our busy citywe have an influx of visitors.The Prime Minister has said that hospitality and leisure businesses are not likely to open before July. The shops and attractions are still closed and we want people who do not live in Brighton and Hove to stay away.James Mason, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: In March we asked people to stay away from our many beauty spots - coastline and countryside - to prevent the spread of Covid-.We welcome the road map to recovery but with caution. Please respect that these communities are not yet able to cope with tourism.The Forestry Commission also urged people to stay at home and only travel to woodsthey live nearby and are able to walk there.A spokesman told MailOnline: Although this is great news and we look forward to welcoming visitors back to the nations forests as soon as we can, our priority is to keep people safe.Please continue to avoid making unnecessary journeys and do not travel to the nations forests.

But the safe corridor will not kick in until at least halfway through next month.Entry into France is still heavily restricted until at least June , after Mr Macron extended the need for all visitors to the country to fill out a form stating their reason for travel.And for the moment, authorities on both sides of the Channel have also made it clear that visits to holiday homes remain banned.

Non-contact sports such as tennis, golf and angling will be allowed.People can play only with those in their own household or one other person and must keep two metres apart.Basketball courts can open but people will be allowed to play team sports only with fellow household members.And it will be possible to meet one other person from another household in an outdoor space as long as they keep two metres apart.Speaking in the Commons today, Mr Johnson said: “You can now walk, sit and rest in parks.”Step  from June  could see households choosing one other group to include in their “double bubble”.The move — aimed at limiting the risk of inter-household transmissions of the virus — could also help familiesto work by two households sharing childcare.Government scientic advisers said the “bubbles” could include the over-s, despite this age group being in the “clinically vulnerable” category.But the plan would not apply to around . million in the “clinically extremely vulnerable group” who have cancer or other illnesses — many of whom are aged over .They are “strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact” — known as “shielding”.The Government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty said: “We are looking at how to balance those risks in terms of households who are over s.”Primary school children could also start ing to school.

The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp.

The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport.

Many, many tears. A slight joyous moment I guess similar to when the CPS put the charge of death by dangerous driving in place on the Friday before Christmas.But the elation is always short-lived because we shouldnt have to be going through this. It should have never have happened. We shouldnt be in this situation.Dad Tim Dunn said: Its been a massive step for us as a family. It has been a real hard time.In lockdown you have more time to think and you reflect on stuff so it makes it harder.But this news is great news and I am sure this is going to be helping us down the road - its got to be a good thing.Piers called the ordeal a disgrace as he told the parents he wanted to see them get justice.Charlotte said they had only just been able to get back into a routine when the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK and talked about the struggle of not being able to see physically see people for support.Charlotte tearfully said: You cant offload to anybody because you cant see them.You know its brilliant, we have all these internet connections and everything now so you can virtually see them, but to not have those hugs and those cuddles that you really need at a time like this is really far, far more dficult than I thought it would ever be at the beginning.She is currently in lockdown with Harrys stepfather Bruce Charles and son Niall.She added: The three of us are together all day everyday. When Niall comes out of his bedroom, which isnt very often - just to eat.We saw some smiles from him yesterday, which was wonderful, but hes struggling.He had only just got back to the point prior to Covid where he was actually starting to spend an hour maybe two hours a week with a friend or two and of course thats all been taken away as well.Susanna explained that Sacoolas has been charged but would have toto the UK in order to face criminal proceedings.Charlotte replied: We totally understand that, but we shouldnt have to be going through this. She should never have ever gone back to the US in the first place.But the one major thing I think for me that came out with this Interpol notice yesterday is that it encourages us and confirms to us that the UK authorities are finally on the same page as us because they cannot issue a red Interpol notice to anybody that was or is covered by diplomatic immunity.So that gives us confidence that finally after eight of the nine months of losing Harry and the fighting we have done you know the UK authorities are clearly on the same page as us to have taken the decision to put that red Interpol notice out.A Red Notice is a request to global law enforcement organisation to locate a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.On its website, Interpol states it is an international wanted persons notice, but it is not an arrest warrant.Harry, , was killed on August ,  when his motorcycle crashed into an SUV driven by Sacoolas in Northamptonshire.The -year-old mother of three left a US spy base at RAF Croughton and drove on the wrong side of the road when she hit the young motorcyclist.Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and was able toto the US and has since refused toto the UK, sparking international outrage.She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving last December.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January that Sacoolas had to come back to the UK to face trial.But an extradition request submitted by the Home Office was swtly rejected by Pompeo.Boris Johnson has warned US President Donald Trump that failing to extradite Sacoolas would be a denial of justice.Today, the US State Department said Pompeos decision to refuse an extradition request for Harry alleged killer was final.A spokeswoman said the State Department maintained the position that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction.Labours shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the decision by Interpol to issue a red notice highlights the clear and repeated failings of the Foreign Office.She added: Labour is working on a cross-party basis to establish a parliamentary inquiry into how this was allowed to happen and we will continue to raise this with the United States authorities.The Foreign Secretary must now urgently come to the House to explain these failings, and set out how he will engage with his counterparts in the United States to resolve this situation and provide much-needed closure for Harry Dunns family and loved ones.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important.Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home.When asked a second time, the rattled minister replied: Well, employment law has not changed, but that isnt the point.The point is that businesses and employees should be working together to make the best of a very dficult situation.It comes after Boris Johnson published a y plan yesterday to get the country back to school and work without risking a second wave of infections - but many key details were missing.Further guidance is only expected later this week, leaving many Brits confused about the new rules.Throughout his interviews this morning, Mr Hancock insisted that everything is fine with the new roadmap guidance.He told Sky News: The principles are really clear and the public has been sensible so far.The Great British public have really understood what social distancing means, why we need to do it... the principles are outside is better than inside, stay two metres away, wash your hands and clean the surfaces, and see as few people as you can, outside of your household because that virus spreads but we do also at the same time need to get people back to work.Clearing up confusion around the new social distancing rules - which allow Brits who keep their distance to meet up with one other person in the park - Mr Hancock confirmed that it is fine for this to be a dferent person every day from tomorrow.When asked by Sky News  the changes meant Brits could see a dferent person each day in the park, he said: “Yes at greater than two metres.“Being outside is safer than being inside but it is not zero risk.“We are making some baby steps, some relaxation but we are doing it very very carefully because we don’t want that R-rate to get higher than one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"furlough scheme set to wind down from july as lockdown eased rishi sunak to announce","story":"The Chancellor was last night finalising details of tweaks to the taxpayer-funded job retention scheme, which is currently paying . million workers  per cent of their wages - up to a limit of £, per month.The scheme is already due to expire in June but the Chancellor is expected to allow employers to furlough their staff part-time in future to help them ease themselves back to operation, with the possibility of the rest of the wages being topped up by the Government.He is likely to extend it until September, but he is also set to to reduce the taxpayer-funded support down to  or even  per cent.Mr Sunak, who will announce the changes in the Commons at lunchtime, will use the announcement to attempt to slow the alarming rate of people claiming Universal Credit.Yesterday ministers revealed that the Government has now processed around two million Universal Credit claims since mid-March, when the lockdown was imposed.Yesterday Boris Johnson all-but confirmed yesterday that the scheme would be continued in some form beyond June.He told MPs: “It has been one of the most assailant, the most important feature of this country’s response so far to this crisis - that we have looked after some of the lowest paid in our society, the hardest working people and we will continue to do so.”Asked by The Sun what message he would give to people who work in gyms, nightclubs and other leisure and hospitality jobs who are facing months off work, the PM said: “I do believe that they will recover. “We have an ambition to get at least some hospitality going by July , that will be a tough ask, it will be hard to achieve and it depends on a great deal of conditionality that I’ve set out. But that’s the ambition, that’s the target that we’re setting, so at least some of the jobs will start to come back.“And then over the medium term, I’ve absolutely no doubt that the UK economy is immensely resilient and will come back. But we’re going to have to think a lot more –we can’t get a vaccine fast then we’re going to have to think a lot more how we make our businesses, our lives Covid-secure while continuing with economic activity. But we’re a very ingenious bunch, the Brits, I’m sure we’ll find ways forward, and that is what we intend to do.”But Labour has urged him not to cut the scheme too soon - for fear of harming the economy and for jobs to be lostThe Resolution Foundation urged him to keep the scheme open longer for workers in the hardest hit sectors in order to acknowledge the Government’s roadmap revealed some sectors will have to stay shut for at least the rest of this year.It also wants the Government to allow partial furloughing from June onwards - enabling employees toto work for some hours, while still receiving  per cent of their wages for the hours that they remained furloughed.Currently the scheme requires furloughed employees not to be working at all in order to qualy for the scheme.The Federation of Small Businesses have long-campaigned for employers to furlough staff part-time. FSB boss Mike Cherry said last night: “The vast majority of small employers have furloughed staff and they’re telling us loud and clear that the ability to do so on a part-time basis as we move towards recovery will be key to keeping their operations afloat. For firms that don’t have the green light to open until July at the very earliest in particular, we need to see schemes extended signicantly – not least the job retention scheme.”Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride suggested a tapering down of the furloughing scheme to protect jobs and ease the burden on the Exchequer.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to the NHS, the disease primarily affects children under five years of age.These include:Although it mainly affects children, Kawasaki disease can also be found in adults. The chances of this, however, is typically very low.The blood vessels become swollen which can lead to complications in the coronary arteries . Kawasaki disease can cause aneurysms which can lead to a heart attack and heart disease.James Bradley said he had seen a six-year-old who also had a pinkish, raised and itchy rash on their belly button and back.Speaking to the Huffington Post he added: I’ve seen other patients that it’s more like an eruption of small red bumps, which we’ve seen mostly in patients who are admitted with more serious infections going on. It’s hard for us to knowthis is a viral manestation or an immune response.On the increased number of patients presenting with Covid toes he said a lot of such skin manestations are a representation of what is going on internally with the organs.Covid toes can be found on the side or sole of the foot and in some cases has been seen on hands and fingers.The European Journal of Pediatric Dermatology said there had been a epidemic of cases in Italy involving children and young adults.It is a condition that had not previously been linked to the virus.Bradley added that when you get blueish and reddish toes, it’s either thrombosis or damage to the vessels.Other specialists have claimed that there are a iety of skin issues to look out for and said skin conditions in Covid patients can be “extraordinarily erse”.Dermatologist Harold Lancer said hive-like rashes are the most common conditions he has seen.At the beginning of this month there were numerous reports of children experiencing rashes and developing Kawasaki like symptoms.The condition causes inflation in the blood and can present during or after a Covid infection.Doctors have said that such rashes can be present in people who are not suffering from any other Covid symptoms and data from both China and Italy, two of the first hot spots of the virus, states that two to  percent of patients also had skin conditions.While it’s important to seek help from medical professionalsyou think you have the coronavirus, specialists also say that what you have put onto your skin can also cause reactions.During the pandemic many people may have had to switch their usual brands of washing detergent and shower products due to a lack of availability, while others may have taken the opportunity to try something new in their skin care regime.Dermatologists have said to keep a log of any new medication you may have been taking or anything new you have been using on your skin in order to determine whether it is in fact this that has caused a reaction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Years R,  and , along with nurseries and childminders, are expected to resume lessons followed by Years , ,  and  later in June. But primary schools will look radically dferent to how they did before, new guidance confirms. The virus will be managed by having half-sized classes, one-way corridors and staggered break and drop-off times. Soft furnishings will be removed and whole classes will have to go home for two weeksone child gets sick with Covid-.But teaching unions have warned that the plan is reckless and the ambition for all year groups toto primary schools by summer is not feasible. Almost , people have signed a petition demanding the option for parents not to send kids back to school unless they feel itaposs safe. Primary school pupils are going back first because they fall less seriously ill with Covid-, and because the impact on them missing education is the worst.Secondary school pupils are not expected back until September, apart from some contact for years  and . So how will primary schools look dferent  Weaposve looked at  key points in the government guidance. . Classes will have split in half - with just  pupils in each room  Primary schools have been told to split classes in half - with just  pupils in each room. And those groups must be kept consistent, with pupils in one group not mixing with friends in another group. The reason is the government accepts young children wonapost be able to stay two metres apart at all times. So the government is accepting thatthere is an outbreak, it might spread in a class. But that class will be smaller, minimising the size of any outbreak. Smaller class sizes will also allow desks to be put as far apart as possible. If there arenapost enough teachers, teaching assistants will take classes. . If one child gets Covid-, the whole class will have to go home for  weeks  If one child tests positive for Covid-, their whole class of  - plus the teacher - will need to go home and self-isolate for  days. This doesnapost need to happen the moment a child gets a cough or a fever. If a child falls ill, they should go home and their entire household should self-isolate for  days. While theyaposre self-isolating, the child or parents should then order a home coronavirus test or go to a drive-through testing centre. If the child tests negative, they can go back to school. If they test positive, their whole class of  must then go into isolation at home for two weeks. Their classmatesapos families do not need to self-isolate too - unless that classmate then gets symptoms, in which case that household self-isolates for  days. If a wider outbreak is detected in a school, Public Health England could advise entire year groups or even the whole school to shut. . Teachers wearing PPE like masks to deal with sick kids  Teachers will need to wear PPEtheyaposre caring for a child who has fallen ill at school. Teachers are advised to keep a two-metre distance, but wear protective kitthis isnapost possible. If contact with the child or young person is necessary, then gloves, an apron and a face mask should be worn by the supervising adult, the guidance says. If a risk assessment determines that there is a risk of splashing to the eyes, for example from coughing, spitting, or vomiting, then eye protection should also be worn. Sick children who are waiting to be picked up should ideally be moved to an isolated room behind a closed door - but with the window open for ventilation. Andthey need the toilet, they should use a separate bathroom to everyone  which is then cleaned afterwards using standard products.The guidance says most staff in education settings will not require PPE when they open up. Children and staff are not required to wear a face covering or face mask in schools and early years settings.It should only be worn by a supervising adulta pupil becomes unwell with symptoms of coronavirus while in the setting. . Soft furniture will be removed The advice suggests nurseries and schools should remove soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean - including with intricate parts. . Corridors will have one-way systems Schools should consider introducing one-way circulation, or placing a ider down the middle of the corridor, to keep young people apart, the guidance says. . Staggered breaks and new drop-off and pick-up times The guidelines advise schools to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around. This could mean changing start and finish times for dferent pupils or having staggered pick-ups. Start and finish times will be clearly communicated to parents and carers alongside any other new arrangements, the guidance says.  . Fewer school buses Children, young people and parents are being encouraged to walk or cycle where possible. As with everyone , people are being urged to avoid public transportat all possible. The guidance says schools, trusts and councils should work together on how to apply this guidance to home-to-school transport such as school buses. . Your child canapost see some friends in their own class Children are being halved into groups of  to create little aposbubblesapos where the virus wonapost spread further. This means the consistent groups will be kept from mixing with other pupils during the day. So half the Bears class of Year  will not be able to mix with the other half of the Bears class of Year . . They may have to be shted to another school The guidance accepts some education settings wonapost be able to achieve half-sized classes due to a lack of space. Those schools should discuss the options with their council or trust - but they could include some children attending a nearby school.

The Tories gave the contract for four Tide-force vessels to Daewoo in South Korea in  – despite warnings the move would cost British jobs. Penny Mordaunt ordered an investigation into the deal when she was Defence Secretary for three months last summer. She said learning lessons from the contract could have an impact on a separate £.billion deal for three Navy supply vessels. MPs, unions and campaigners fear the contract for those Fleet Solid Support ships could also go abroad – jeopardising thousands of UK jobs.But the Government plans to keep the study into the refuelling tankersapos deal under wraps, despite a Freedom of Information request by the GMB union. The head of the Ministry of Defenceaposs information rights team, Sandra Gardiner, refused to release the findings – despite admitting they would “undoubtedly be of wider public interest”. She says there is “a strong public interest in greater awareness of the issues behind the MoD’s policy approach to shipbuilding in the UK and abroad and the economic implications that may arise”. But, in a six-page letter to the GMB, seen by the Mirror, she says: “The ongoing public debate around shipbuilding in the UK versus abroad is politically contentious and to place the report, which contains very frank assessments, into the public domain would likely serve to constrain the governmentaposs future policy options. “Disclosure of this information would be likely prejudice of the formulation of a sound, evidence-based policy as it would reduce the willingness of officials to present such a frank analysis.” She adds: “I am therefore satisfied that disclosure of this report would damage the integrity of that process.”  Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions maritime chairman, GMB national officer Ross Murdoch, said: “Itaposs outrageous that that this critical report is being suppressed. The union is spearheading the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, calling on ministers to give the Fleet Solid Support contract to a British yard. Urging the Conservatives to “do the right thing by securing the future of the UK shipbuilding industry”, Mr Murdoch said: “Ministers promised us a shipbuilding renaissance but instead many of our members and their communities are fearful for their future as the orders have dried up. “The UK’s shipbuilding workers are as skilled as any in the world, but our industry cannot compete with the articial subsidies enjoyed by many foreign bidders. “These jobs are critical to our national security. “The Navy needs ships, and the UK supply chain, including steel, needs work – it really is a no-brainer.” Ms Mordaunt, who is back in government as Paymaster General, ordered the report almost exactly a year ago during her brief stint as Defence Secretary. Speaking on May  at the Royal United Service Instituteaposs  Sea Power Conference, she said: “We have to continually learn, which is why I’ve commissioned work examining the lessons from the MARStanker procurement, especially for our UK supply chain.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rattled matt hancock insists people","story":"NewsRattled Matt Hancock claims people understand confusing lockdown changesThe Health Secretary claimed things are fine and the rules are clear despite an avalanche of questions over how coronavirus rules will apply from WednesdayShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-insists-coronavirus-message-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics rattled-matt-hancock-insists-people-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But Mr Hancockaposs response comes despite complaints across the political ide about mixed messaging over the roadmap to ease the lockdown. From tomorrow people in England will be able to take unlimited exercise, drive to beauty spots, sit in the park with one person from another household and play golf, tennis and angling - all while staying two metres away. A roadmap also lays out how schools and non-essential shops can begin to reopen from June , folllowed by some in the hospitality industry from July . But the launch of the roadmap has been hit by a string of rows over confused messaging. They include:England now has dferent restrictions to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after national leaders disagreed with Mr Johnson. The government replaced its stay at home slogan with stay alert, then later explained staying alert includes staying at home as much as possible. Dominic Raab said you could meet both parents in a public place from two metres away - but he was incorrect. Only two people, one from each household, may meet in a public place in a socially distanced way. Boris Johnson told the Commons last week that changes would be made on Monday, but in fact they are coming into force on Wednesday. Boris Johnson said those who canapost work from home shouldto work this week. After alarm from unions, it emerged he meant Wednesday - but that only became clear on Monday morning. The government said childminders couldto work in England from this week, only to later clary they will onlyfrom June.A live event held by the Mirror yesterday was bombarded with hundreds of questions about how the restrictions will be eased. And a member of the public, Pooja from Solihull, blasted the Prime Minister last night over the vague instructions to the public. While explaining why the instructions were perfectly clear, Mr Johnson briefly switched to speaking French. Even the former Tory leader William Hague today said Boris Johnson should consider changing his approach.Lord Hague said the approach of delivering a straightforward and direct message paid off in the early day of the battle against coronavirus - but more nuance and detail was needed now. The Prime Minister has told the country stay alert, control the virus and save lives in new messaging, but the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have stuck with the stay home message.Writing in the Daily , Lord Hague said Mr Johnsonaposs team deserved credit for their prowess in coining slogans like Get Brexit Done and Take Back Control.But he added: Such slogans also have their limitations, particularly when the simplicities of campaigning are succeeded by the complexities of governing. Slogans donapost workyou have to change them repeatedly, endlessly explain them, ordferent versions are employed at the same time. Mr Hancock clashed over the subject with BBC Radio aposs Today programme. When told workers were left confused after thinking they had to go back on Monday, only to be told belatedly it was Wednesday, he said: “Well I thinkthat’s the biggest complaint the Today programme has, then I think things are fine. He added: The truth is that people really understand the message, people understand what ‘Stay Alert’ means, it means… er, and people understand that together we need to control the virus, and make sure people follow the social distancing rules.

Do not travelyouaposre unwell or clinically extremely vulnerablePeople have been asked not to take any non-essential travel by public transport, but evenyour trip is essential you shouldnapost take ityou have any coronavirus symptoms or are part of the vulnerable groups, people with underlying conditions, who the Government have urged to shield themselves.If youaposre self-isolating you should also, obviously, avoid public transport Check ahead and travel when quieter Even as public transport routes begin to step up activity, there is still likely to be disruption to the nornal arrangements, so the government is asking people to plan a head by identying alternative routes and options in case of unexpected disruption. They also suggest thatcan, travel at off-peak times, and you should ask your employer to consider letting you start late or leave early to avoid peaks.  Buy tickets ahead of time Where possible, book your travel online through your transport provider’s ticketing app or website. Consider contactless payment to buy tickets. Try and keep social distance If you can take a less busy route, you should try and obviously where possible you should keep metres away from people. But where that isnapost possible the advice is to keep the time you spend nears others as short as possible and avoid physical contact. It adds: Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. To avoid crowds it suggests you try to start or end your journey using a station or mode of transport you know to be quieter or more direct. For instance, walk the first or last mile of your journey, or alight at an earlier station, where this is possible.  Wear a face covering and travel lightly While the guidance stresses that wearing a face covering is not a legal requirement it stresses thatyou can wear one while on public transport you should. And it suggests making a list of items that you need to take with you in order to minimise the luggage you take. Also, the advice suggests you donapost eat or drink on public transport. Pay attention to the safety instructions around you and follow basic travel ettiquette Operators have been told they must set out schemes to try and make travelling more secure and this will mean restrictions on where you stand or how to queue. It goes without saying that you should follow these. It may mean going into or out of a dferent entrance or only boarding from a particular part of the train or bus.

Of the first eight children, aged four to , who were treated - seven required the use of a ventilator. The -year-old later tested positive for coronavirus. The “cluster” of cases was detected in south east London - focused in the Woolwich and Southwark areas of the capital. Parents have been urged to not delay in seeking medical helptheir child is unwell. Doctors who uncovered the disease at Evelina London Children’s Hospital say it is similar to Kawasaki disease - a rare inflammatory disease which mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause high temperatures, swelling and a red rash, and requires immediate hospital treatment. Hospitals nationwide have been alerted to what experts describe as a “new phenomenon” linked to coronavirus. Dr Sara Hanna, the Evelina’s medical director said: “We probably saw the first case in the middle of March.  “We had a child admitted with something very like Kawasaki – a bit like something we call toxic shock syndrome. “In the last two weeks, we have just seen this cluster of children where some of them look very like Kawasaki. “They have a high persistent fever, they have got red eyes, they have got a rash, they have got swollen hands and feet.” Doctors said blood tests were not testing positive for the virus in children, but other indicators were “remarkably similar” to those seen in adults with Covid-. Antibodies indicating recovery from Covid- were later found in about half the children. And Dr Hanna described the timing of the outbreak of the disease as “suspicious”.

Boris Johnsonaposs -page blue print for easing Britain out of lockdown includes the possibility of expanding household groups to allow those isolated some more social contact. While details are vague for certain sectors, including over-s, the Prime Minister has reiterated the elderly are not in the aposshieldedapos group of highly vulnerable - implying they could be allowed to mix with other family soon.People vulnerable to the virus, including those with underlying health problems were told mid-March to stay indoors for  weeks - which is now likely to be extended.Confusingly, this group did initially appear to include all over-s. But Mr Johnson said yesterday: Over s need to understand they need to take care but itaposs not quite right to say theyaposre shielded. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    He also said: All the rules of social distancing of course apply to them and apply particularly strongly to them, but otherwise they can go about their lives. The Government has asked the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesto look into the safety aspects involved of allowing households to come together, according to the report.  This strategy could be based on the New Zealand model of household aposbubblesapos which could allow two households to come into contact, for example to share childcare. But thereaposs no confirmed date as to when this may come into being. Those who are not in the shielded group but who are more vulnerable to Covid-, such as the over-s, should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded, says the blueprint.

The blackmailer threatened to release videos and images of the sexual encounter to the media unless the tycoon handed over cash. Westminster Magistratesapos Court heard the father was a businessman of public standing while his son was somebody who struggles with their gender identity and sexuality. Julie Idowu, prosecuting, said both were well-known public figures, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Jack Gibson, , is accused of blackmailing both father and son.  He was arrested at the Sidney Hotel near Victoria Station in central London on April . Ms Idowu said: Complainant number two is a businessman of public standing. The other complainant is somebody who struggles with their gender identity and sexuality. She said Gibson had videos and pictures of the son he had taken throughout the night in his flat after they had intercourse on two separate occasions. The defendant had been in talks with the media to release the videos and pictures which seemed to be concerning matters that occurred in private. He was found at a hotel when he was arrested. Heaposs already been in negotiations with the press about releasing the bits of evidence he had. He has referred to backing up the evidence. He still has these pieces of evidence to use to blackmail the witnesses in this case. His intention is still to release these to the press. We donapost want the media to out their sexuality or gender. District Judge Samuel Goozee said he needed to know the identities of the alleged blackmail victims but Ms Idowu said they had not even been disclosed to her by the CPS. The judge added: Iaposve made a press restriction order prohibiting publication of the two complainants in this case.

As Chief Nursing Officer for England Ruth May offered her thanks to her “incredible staff”, we speak to nurses around the country who tell of battling the virus... Stuart Tuckwood Critical care nurse Stuart, , from London, has been nursing for six years and moved to work in intensive care during the pandemic. He was inspired to become a nurse after working as a carer and seeing the huge dference his nursing colleagues made. He is now the national officer for nursing at the union UNISON.  Stuart says: “I have to pay tribute to my intensive care colleagues who not only have been treating patients at their sickest but also overseeing the work of nurses like myself who have just stepped intotheir departments.“It is incredibly challenging, skilful work. I’ve had to learn new skills, in an intense environment and you can be wearing PPE all night, which is hard. “I have looked after some patients who are awake and on oxygen, and we are trying to keep them off the ventilators.  “It is scary for them as they are struggling to breathe, and it’s emotionally draining for the nurses having to care for them and keep in touch with their families. I did a sht on another ward last week where people recovering from the virus were being treated. “It was so rewarding to see how our work has helped them to get better.” Zoe Carciente AE nurse  Zoe is one of the thousands of nurses who have joined the profession on the front line of the NHS, weeks before properly qualying. But in the AE department of her local North West Lon­­don hospital, -year-old Zoe is a full team member. She says: “My le changed so rapidly but nursing is what I want to do and I’m not one to panic, so just threw myself into the job.  For students like myself, this is what we came into it for.” The mother of two, who retrained as a nurse after her children became more independent, says that nursing is in her blood. “My mother used to work as an ITU nurse and it was just something I wanted to do myself. “It has been a daunting time but the staff have been so hugely supportive of us.” Katie Kearns Ward Sister Katie, , is in charge of the first ward atthe Royal Marsden Hospital in London to treat Covid- patients.Katie, who has been nursing for eight years, says: “It was daunting at first. The main thing was that my staff were scared and I wanted to reassure them that they would be protected by the hospital, the Trust and the NHS.  I have three newly qualied nurses so I was very aware that they were junior in their careers. “But sometimes they have really been the ­backbone and they have been incredible. “I have always made sure that my staff are looking after themselves as well. “It is dficult when patients get very sick.  For those who have been very poorly and may not live, we have in exceptional cases let a family member come and say their goodbyes and leave.” Katie appreciates the public support, saying: “It really makes you proud of what you do. I love going past people’s houses and seeing the pictures that children have drawn in the windows.” Beth Kimber Head of infection prevention  Beth, , works for Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust and has been instrumental in setting up the area’s ­swabbing and testing regime. She and colleagues have also been testing in care homes. She says: “The residents are high risk but they aren’t scared.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton teams up royal","story":"NewsKate Middleton teams up with Royal Familys secret weapon as Queen asks them to step upWith the Queen self-isolating and Meghan Markle and Prince Harry quitting, other members of the Royal Family have been asked to step up to official duties to help William and Kate Middleton during the coronavirus pandemicShareCommentsByRussell MyersZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY NewsKate and Sophie are very close \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

We just have to do our best to help but by following the rules people can make sure there will be intensive care beds free for when they are needed.” She said the spike in cases was a shock but one of the biggest changes in dealing with the epidemic was the introduction of PPE. She said: “It is very warm and you do feel a bit overwhelmed at times but patient care has not changed. “We have to try to safeguard not only the staff but people outside coming in, so patients cannot get visitors and that has been a challenge. “Our patients are never alone, there is always a nurse with them. “We do video messages to send to relatives and they can send messages for patients. But we treat patients asthey are our own family. They get the same care and the same compassion.” The most moving moment Annmarie experienced since the outbreak began was when their first Covid patient was able to leave ICU. But, sadly, not all patients make it to the other side. She added: “We do what we can to the best of our ability. “To a certain extent, Covid is just another factor in critical care but the numbers of those dying has increased.

Outlining plans yesterday, the Prime Minister said employers must be “Covid-secure”. But it emerged coronavirus-related death rates are highest in the working class. Unison’s Dave Prentis said: “There has to be a safeto work. We’ve got to get this right. If we don’t, more lives will be lost.” Guidance on what businesses can reopen, and how, was given in a roadmap for lockdown exit intended to end confusion. But Labour chief Keir Starmer said “clarity and reassurance” remained in “short supply.” Johnson attempted to ­clary Sunday’s confusing message to the nation yesterday by urging people to start going back to work this weekthey can. But the Prime Minister’s call came as figures showed working-class men have the greatest risk of dying from Covid- – sparking fears the lowest-paid could be forced to put themselves in harm’s way to reboot the economy. And despite his efforts to inspire confidence over the route out of lockdown, the Government continued to face accusations of mixed messaging. Mr Johnson said in the Commons employers must “look after workers” and be “Covid-secure, Covid-compliant”. He told MPs: “Anyone who cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work and sectors allowed to be open should indeed be open but subject to social distancing.” Getting us back to work is a key part of the Covid- Recovery Strategy, in which the Business Department gave guidance for eight settings – including factories, offices and call centres. But the Office for National Statistics said security guards, taxi drivers, carers, bus drivers, chefs and retail assistants have higher death rates involving Covid- than other workers. And as the UK death toll rose by  yesterday to hit ,, union leaders warned of an unacceptable risk to stafftheyto the front line with the pandemic still raging. Unite demanded a public inquiry into “why low-paid workers appear to be at most risk of dying from Covid-”. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “There has to be a safeto work. This guidance should’ve come much sooner. People are bewildered by the confusing and often conflicting messages from Government. We’ve got to get this right. If we don’t, more lives will be lost and there’ll be a second spike.”  RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “This is the Government making it up as they go along in the middle of a pandemic. It’s a shambles and it’s my members in the transport sector whose lives are on the line. The wholeto work policy should be put on hold until safety can be guaranteed.” No’s blueprint to ease the lockdown recommends wearing face coverings on public transport and in some shops – but they will not be compulsory. Advice for offices includes using tape or paint to keep workers two metres apart and erecting screens. For businesses offering takeaways, guidance includes kitchen workstations two metres apart and asking customers to wait in cars. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the safety guidelines “are a step in the right direction”. She added: “People will only feel confidentGovernment and employers act now to make safer working a reality. Getting this right is in the national interest. If rogue employers cut corners it puts us all at risk of another spike and Government must get to grips with the ongoing crisis in PPE as more workers start to require it.” The roadmap also outlines dates on which parts of normal le could resume in England – but Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own plans.  Non-essential shops will not open until June  at earliest and onlybosses can prove they can keep customers and staff safe. Hairdressers, cafes and restaurants will stay closed until at least July , as will places of worship. Businesses trading again yesterday included garden centres and coffee shops, including  Pret a Manger sites. The PM said keeping the “R” rate – the virus spread – below one would help decide the timetable. He said: “Our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous, so at this stage we can go no further than the first careful modications of our measures.” But he continued to face accusations of muddled messaging. No said on Sunday some changes would take effect for employees ing to work from Monday. Yet when Mr Johnson made his TV address, he failed to spell out when the shake-up would come into force. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible And Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday gave conflicting messages on social distancing and s to work. He said rules would be in force from Wednesday, sparking confusion on why the PM announced them on Sunday. Labour leader Keir Starmer told the Commons: “What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and both are in pretty short supply.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen holds six guinness world","story":"NewsQueen holds six Guinness World Records - including one for her bank accountThe Queen has six Guinness World Records, including Wealthiest Queen, most countries to be Head of State of simultaneously, and most longest reigning monarchShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY NewsThe Queen has lots of impressive records to her name \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Senior aides have created a programme dubbed the Royal Task Force aimed at extending The Firm’s public presence. Prince Edward, , and we Sophie, , will take on more duties while the Queen self-isolates. Royal sources have confirmed that the monarch is “more determined than ever towhen the time is right”. But in the meantime she is said to be in constant contact with Prince Charles and Prince William. She has told them that the family “must have a united front” to help the country heal when the crisis is over, sources have confirmed. Since Prince Harry, , and Meghan, , quit their royal roles to move to the US, the family have been working to ensure charities that rely on royal support are taken care of. William, , and Kate, , have been at the forefront of the plan. They have held regular Zoom calls with frontline NHS workers, school staff and pupils of key workers and ious charities. The couple also spoke to Second World War veterans ahead of the th anniversary of VE Day last week. A royal source said: “There is going to be a lot more interaction between the family members while the crisis is ongoing.  “Her Majesty has given instructions that, after a turbulent period for the family last year, now is the time to heal and have a united front and get back to the basics of what the monarchy is for – her sole belief is that it goes back to the basics of duty.” Prince Charles, , Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have opened, via video link, the emergency NHS Nightingale Hospitals in recent weeks. The Countess has been seen more than ever during the crisis, offering tips to other parents on Instagram to help boost morale.  She has also used the  to promote charities and urge people to reach out for help when they need it amid the lockdown. Sophie has helped to publicise advice from the children’s charity NSPCC and the National Autistic Society. Insiders speak of her “natural charm” and “genuine warmth”.  A palace source added: “She is one of the nicest people you could ever meet. She’s incredibly hard working, no nonsense and she really cares about people and the causes she works on. The public has seen that as well and through the crisis she has been seen more and more. That can only be a good thing for everyone involved.” Prince William, meanwhile, has announced a new fund from the National Emergencies Trust’s coronavirus appeal, which has already distributed nearly £milllion to those who are struggling. The fund helps to provide vital supplies and support to those in need. Kate has launched a project called Hold Still in conjunction with the National Portrait Gallery, asking people to send in personal images of the pandemic.

Belly Mujinga, , who had suffered long-term respiratory problems, died in hospital on April  –  days after the alleged assault at London’s Victoria Station. The mother-of-one and an unnamed colleague was with her at the time and was also spat on, and both went on to contract Covid-. Their attacker, who has not been identied, allegedly told his victims that he had the virus. Although the other woman recovered, Belly’s condition deteriorated after she started to feel ill. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here She died just three days after being admitted to an intensive care ward and put on a ventilator. Her husband Lusamba, , and their daughter Ingrid, , never got to say goodbye. Ingrid had one last video call from her mum in her bed at Barnet Hospital before she became too sick to talk. Last night, Lusamba said Belly had asked for a back office job when the threat of Covid- became apparent in early March. But he alleges that her employer Thameslink, which runs services through the capital, insisted that she should continue dealing with customers face to face, before social-distancing rules had been installed. Lusamba, of Hendon, North London, said his we had made her bosses aware of her health issues following an operation three years ago. Belly was diagnosed with the lung condition sarcoidosis, which causes shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. “My daughter Ingrid just does not understand what has happened, how we can never be together again” the former warehouse worker said.  “It’s terrible to lose the person you love so quickly. “We are sure she got the virus from the man who spat on her, and it could have been so easily avoided. “He just shouted at them, ‘What are you doing here ’ and then spat over them deliberately. Belly was so upset and so scared.  “Our doctor had told us that she should keep away from people from three months because she was at risk. It was too dangerous, he told us. “After this happened he called the train company, but by then it was too late, she had already been infected.” Belly and Lusama came to Britain from the Democratic Republic of Congo as political refugees seeking refuge after facing persecution in their birth country. Both had worked hard to get a better le for themselves and their daughter. Belly was a member of the TSSA transport workers’ union, which has reported the alleged attack to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail , for investigation. It believes the £, compensation which will be paid to relatives of health and care workers who die as a result of the pandemic should be extended to front-line transport staff too. General secretary Manuel Cortes said parent company GTR did not treat the assault seriously enough. “Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them,” he said. “However, there are serious questions about her death, it wasn’t inevitable. “As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why GTR didn’t stand her down from front line duties early on in this pandemic.” Angie Doll, Managing Director of Southern Railway and Gatwick Express said: “We are devastated that our dedicated colleague Belly has passed away and our deepest sympathies are with her family with whom we have been in touch with through this very dficult time.

Yet we have also never been more connected – to our neighbours, our families, and to all those experiencing the coronavirus across the world. The virus has turned our lives upside down. But it has also shown how our country can pull together. Want to help you build on this on this, launching an exciting, new, ground-breaking project, Britain Connects – connecting people across the UK with dferent views for a virtual chat. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them  What is it  The aim is to speak to someone you might not usually meet, to find out what they are like and explore what our nation has in common, whatever our political or other dferences. We hope that by connecting people as we reach peak isolation during the coronavirus crisis, we can help bring the country together. With your help, this could be a unique moment of connection – and a positive and meaningful way of marking a one-off moment in global history and all of our lives. How does it work  To take part, all you need to do is fill in this questionnaire here. We’ll do the rest… We will match people across age, across geography, across le experience and across political lines. Whoever we are, we all facing this together. We’ll match you with someone who has dferent views and set up a video meeting on the weekend - May.  What better way to spend the late May bank holiday than by staying in, saving lives, protecting the NHS – and connecting with someone new  Just fill out the survey to get started. What can I hope to get out of it  Last year, the Daily Mirror teamed up with political rivals theand many of Reach PLC’s regional titles to bring you Britain Talks, which asked people to cross the Brexit ide for a cup of tea and a chat. This year, we’re teaming up again to ask people with dferent experiences of le during the coronavirus to meet up using the technologies keeping many of us in touch with our family and friends. We are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team, who helped us build Britain Connects and are studying our project for a paper later this year.“The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,” they say. “This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before.

Boris Johnson has thrashed out a deal with French President Emmanuel Macron which would mean a -day quarantine period onhome can be bypassed in a bid to boost tourism.However, the corridor will all depend on the UK and France having a similar aposRapos infection rating and will likely not come into affect until at least mid-June.A senior government source told The Sun : “There is a lot of work to be done yet, but the PM and the President both believe a travel corridor is possible, and desirable.We’re in a pretty similar situation to France at the moment, so keeping the channel tunnel and airports open to new arrivals shouldn’t increase the risk to us. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   The deal would also include business travel as well as truck drivers. However, until at least June  travel to France requires the completion of a form clarying the reason for visiting.Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said that all travellers entering the UK would be quarantined for  days in a bid to stop re-infection from abroad during his address to the nation on Sunday.But Downing Street later issued a statement saying Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had agreed quarantine measures would not apply between France and the UK at this stage, according to a joint statement. Downing Street issued the statement after the pair spoke over the phone on Sunday.  The leaders spoke about the need to manage the risk of new transmissions arising from abroad, as the rate of coronavirus decreases domestically, it read. In this regard, the Prime Minister and the President agreed to work together in taking forward appropriate border measures. This co-operation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border. No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner.  A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks. In his address Mr Johnson said he would soon be implementing the measure in order to prevent re-infection from abroad. I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission signicantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air, he said.  Some people have criticised the government for not imposing this measure sooner with other countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore already having introduced similar measures. However, Mr Johnson says it is only now that it will be effective. He explained: It is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.While Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: The reason that the measures are being introduced now is because the advice that weaposve always had is that there was little point,any, in introducing quarantine at the border with the R level and the level of, the prevalence of the virus at a high level, particularly above the R level.The PM is expected to give further details on this measure in the coming days.The quarantine measure is one of a set of new rules, intended to help avoid a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections as lockdown restrictions are gradually eased."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast 22c highs","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: C highs to melt chilly cold snap as mini heatwave sSince the weekends C highs the temperatures in Britain have plummeted while a bitter breeze made Monday feel like ato winter.

High pressure moving into the south of England will see temperatures slowly begin to heat up as the week goes on, before peaking on Sunday, according to forecasters. While next week is set to be much drier for many as the calendar moves quickly towards the summer, with lockdown restrictions slowly being eased. BBC meteorologist Ben Rich said high pressure is currently sitting to the west of the British Isles bringing isobars from the Arctic bringing in the unwelcome cold air. But that pressure will begin to sht east and then southwards as the week goes on which will allow some signicantly warmer air to move in, and Brits can expect those temperatures to begin to climb. Much-anticipated hotter temperatures will really take hold by Thursday and Friday with highs of C, before that things will remain fairly chilly with some rain. Parts of Scotland will see daytime temperatures as low as C today and despite parts of England will reach C, that will be hindered by biting winds.  Mr Rich said by the weekend the high pressure will have moved through the north, leaving it exposed to frontal systems, but southerns can expect a lot of dry weather. Some spells of sunshine and at this stage some warmer air starting to waft its way in.  degrees is likely. Further north temperatures recovering a little bit, certainly warmer than recent days but thereaposs more chance across northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland of seeing colder and some showery rain at times.  The forecaster said next week the high pressure will build its way back north meaning dry weather for more of the UK, though rain is likely in the north west.This week has so far seen ato cooler, more springlike weather, following the warm and sunny spells seen during the first half of the bank holiday weekend.Temperatures on Saturday peaked at .C in London, and remained widely into the s for many parts of the UK. Sunday saw maximum temperatures drop by around  degrees across the country, with a cloud front moving southwards - though some southern parts remained warm.The Met Office has said the increased cloud and wind in the coming week is nothing signicant or unusual for this time of year.Some parts of the UK can expect to see frostier mornings. Part of springaposs charm is you can get both types of weather, a spokesman for the Met Office said.

Theyaposve just made an appearance, alongside a wider range of exotic #chocolate bars, so theyaposre well worth picking up next time you pop in for an essential shop! and also thanked @kevssnackreviews for snapping the picture.Kev, who has a snack review Instagram account, revealed that each of the two new bars - the Cadbury Dairy Milk Moro Block and the Cadbury Dairy Milk Crispy Mint Creme - as well as Cadburyaposs Top Deck, retail for £. at the store. Speaking about the Cadbury Dairy Milk Moro Block, he said: These are a must.  He added: The Dairy Milk tastes better quality than our UK version, richer and more like it used to back in the day. The pockets of caramel are lovely and again tastes better than UK Cadbury caramel. The chocolate malt filling gives a rich malty flavour, it’s very chocolatey but with a distinct malted edge. All together it’s delicious! And went on to say that even though he loves mint chocolate, it can be hard to get the combinations right, revealing that the Cadbury Dairy Milk Crispy Mint Creme was not his favourite out of the new two. He said: Here, there’s the creamy Dairy Milk coating a sweet but strong mint flavour creme. Think mint chip ice cream. The crunchy pieces add some nice texture and overall it’s very sweet and minty. I’m not sure this is my favourite so far - I preferred the Moro block. Butyou’re a mint lover this is one you’ll surely enjoy!

Authorities are racing to contain a fresh wave of infections in Seoul, the countryaposs capital, believed to be linked to the gay party district Itaewon. Gay revellers are reportedly scared to be testeda positive diagnosis contributes to their sexuality being revealed. Some are therefore giving  details, the BBC reports. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsays that of  cases identied on Sunday,  are linked to nightclubs and bars in the area. It has also been reported by local media that another man who tested positive visited an LGBT sauna in Gangnam. South Korea has won global praise for its handling of the pandemic and its test, trace and isolate strategy, and only had a handful of Covid- cases before the latest outbreak. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here But amid the fresh surge there are fears LGBT Koreans are too scared to come forward for testing, in a country where homosexuality is often taboo.As of yesterday, officials were still searching for , people thought to have been at nightclubs who they were struggling to contact, thereports.A gay man in his s told the paper that fear of receiving a positive test result has left him feeling suicidal. I feel so trapped and hunted down. If I get tested, my company will most likely find out I’m gay, he said. I’ll lose my job and face a public humiliation. I feel asmy whole le is about to collapse.  The man says that while he admits it was a huge mistake to visit the district amid the coronavirus pandemic, visiting the area is the only time when I can be myself and hang out with others similar to me.In an effort to control the virus, all revellers who visit nightclubs must give authorities their names and contact numbers. However, the BBC reports some of the details have been found to be , making it dficult to track down and isolate people potentially carrying the infection. In an effort to encourage people to come forward, officials now say that tests can be carried out anonymously.

I think that’s why they took to him right away.“I am delighted for him, he’s still very fit and he’ll be looking to add to the games he has played for this football club.“I know he still believes there is a lot more football in Paul McGowan and I think he’s had another excellent season.”The duo arrived at Dens as players in the summer of  and became fast friends, driving up to Dundee from Glasgow every day.Now McGowan’s boss, McPake admits their relationship has changed somewhat from the days when he’d be on the receiving end of a regular verbal volley on the park.“If there were three people around him then he would still take the ball,” McPake added.“That’s brave –people talk about centre-backs being brave because they’ll put their head where it hurts but Paul McGowan is brave because he’ll take the ball in tight spaces and work something.“He very rarely loses the ball, gets you fouls and there is a respect from other teams to him. I’ve found that as a manager, the amount of times I heard ‘McGowan’s a good player’ from other managers last season.“He was great to play with, he would always take it – he could be a pain when you didn’t give him it and the game is going on up the pitch but he’s still standing trying to argue with you!“That’s Gowser. But there’s more than a screamer or a shouter – he encourages people, he helps people out and he’s honest. He’s the first to put his hand up when he believes he’s done something wrong and that’s gone in the modern game. He sets such high standards.“He’s a voice in the dressing-room as well. I’ve played with him but it’s a completely dferent relationship now.#I was his team-mate and his mate but now we don’t see much of each other apart from on the training ground. The dynamics have changed but I know exactly what I’ll get from him whenever he’s on the pitch.“There have been a few times when I’ve thought ‘I’m glad I’ve got Paul McGowan’. Evenhe’s not played you might think there will be a problem, not playing against United or Aberdeen, but he just accepts it and goes and trains.“There’s no sulking and is great to work with. He was great to play with because he’s such a quality footballer and I’m glad I have him at my disposal as a manager. He’s a leader for our club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/5eb11c73375e91.54485355-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"poll how do you feel about nicola sturgeon continuing with lockdown rules in scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon addressed the nation yesterday and said that “coronavirus is in retreat” and encouraged Scots to remain indoors.People from the rest of the UK have been told not to come to Scotland.There were, as of am yesterday, , people who had officially died from Covid- in Scotland, with , people who had tested positive for the virus.Boris Johnson said the UK Government#s “stay home” slogan would be altered to urge Britons to instead “stay alert”, while businesses, unions and police have called for clarity on the easing of restrictions.In Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the only change to lockdown rules were that people could now go outside more than once a day for exercise, #but otherwise, the Scottish Government is asking people to stick with the lockdown rules for a bit longer#.Watch FM @NicolaSturgeon#s message to Scotland about the importance of continuing to #StayAtHome to protect the NHS and save lives. pic FVKDEadjKmdash Scottish GovernmentMay , The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, echoed Ms Sturgeon#s words, and stressed that coronavirus advice in the nation “has not changed”, with people still urged to stay at home.Overall across the United Kingdom, , have now lost their lives to the virus.Mr Johnson#s new #stay alert# coronavirus message was criticised by Labour leader Keir Strarmer as being #more complicated#, after the PM#s plan to ease lockdown was criticised for being confusing.Mr Johnson said the new coronavirus rules are that anyone who cannot work from home #

A shore station, its light flashes every  seconds.It features two lights, one half way up the tower and one at the top.Buchan Ness, at Peterhead, was built on a rock close to shore, joined to the mainland by a bridge.It is the most easterly lighthouse on the Scottish mainland, and has red and white bands,and flashes every five seconds.Established in , it was created after petitions were received by commissioners in  from the magistrates, town councils and harbour trustees to have a lighthouse built on the site.During the Second World War, a drting mine washed ashore and exploded  yards south of the station. No one was injured however three lantern panes were cracked and  other glass panes broke in the tower, engine room and dwelling houses.Rattray Head,  miles further up the east coast, is an unusual lighthouse designed and built by David Allan Stevenson in , and flashes every  seconds.The light was established  years after Mr Alan Stevenson, lighthouse engineer, had first undertaken his experiments.In Fraserburgh, another  miles north, sits the Kinnaird Head Castle and Lighthouse.It was created in the s for the Fraser family, and is the first lighthouse that was built by the Northern Lighthouse Board.It is the only th Century castle in the world with a lighthouse built through it, and is now the site of the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses.The facility is open to visitors and is a short walk from the museum.Lynda said: #There is something about lighthouses which makes them very special, they evoke many emotional responses from people.#There are a number of reasons why I think lighthouses have been taken to the heart of many visitors.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

A favourite walk follows an old drove road, along which herders would drive their beasts to market, either locally or in the north of England. Wide, and partially cobbled, this route allows you to get into a stride, while scanning trees and sky, or field upon field of horses and their winter foals.A drove road like this could be as old as the village, or even older. Hoolet was officially granted permission to hold a market in the early s, so itrsquos possible that from miles around people traded their animals to and from here along tracks such as this. One of the commonest books yoursquoll find in second-hand book shops is A R B Haldanersquos The Drove Roads of Scotland.Regrettably I have lost my fatherrsquos copy, but have a sellotaped edition of my husbandrsquos. First published in , it looks off-puttingly dry and yet it offers a riveting insight into a way of le so long gone as to feel mythical. By way of research, Haldane spoke to shepherds, farmers, crofters and factors to mine them for local knowledge. The result is a testament to the part livestock and their keepers have played in our history.A colourful passage from a Victorian onlooker describes a livestock ldquotryst at Stenhousemuir, where around , sheep and tens of thousands of cattle were gathered. He writes of the tar pots used to mark sold beasts, the cacophony of cattle dealers, drovers, pedlars, gamblers, ballad singers and beggars, and of servants ldquorunning about shouting to the cattle, keeping them together in their particular lots and ever and anon cudgels are at work upon the horns and rumps of the restless animals that attempt to wander in search of grass or water. Such a welter of beasts recalls the great buffalo herds in the American mid-west, and the drama, and danger, of keeping them under control.Did such a multitude of hooves ever thunder past the village  The old track is so tranquil, despite the orchestration of birds, itrsquos hard to imagine its former use. But I find that is the case with almost everything about country le. Books, newspapers and documentaries constantly inform us about tempting rural walks we can take for our health and pleasure, and walking during lockdown has enjoyed a resurgence in the same way as biking. Yet well into the th century people from a hamlet like ours, and all across the country, walked for miles every day: not as a hobby or to keep fit, but because it was their only means of transport.The picturesque village of Denholm, not far away, is the birthplace of the famous linguist John Leyden. As a young man he once walked  miles in a day, just to record the final verses of a song to add to Sir Walter Scottrsquos compendium of border ballads. The shepherd James Hogg would think nothing of crossing the hills of an evening from the Ettrick valley to Tibbie Shielsrsquo Inn by St Maryrsquos Loch, to carouse with friends. Itrsquos a round trip of over  miles. When his household needed provisions from Selkirk, the nearest town, that would entail another -mile jaunt. Presumably a mule or pony was used for such a distance  But even for the four-legged, that is quite a schlepp.Another legendary walker was Thomas de Quincey, a forerunner of the redoubtable Captain Tom Moore. In the s he planned to cure himself of his ldquoopium misery by walking himself fit, but at this precise moment his legs failed him. His doctorrsquos warnings were dire and, fearing thathe didnrsquot cure himself he would be disabled for the rest of his le, he took to the garden of his cottage near Lasswade. Measuring its perimeter, he estimated  laps came to a mile. Starting out cautiously, he gradually grew stronger. Soon he was doing  or  miles a day until, he wrote, ldquoI had within ninety days walked  miles\". While he lived here, his medical student lodger trudged seven miles to Edinburgh University and back every day, so commonplace an occurrence it was barely worth remarking on.Itrsquos easy to look back on the great distances country folk covered with pity as well as awe, but as any serious walker knows, few things are more enjoyable ndash in decent weather ndash than clocking up the miles. There are moments when you feel like a piece of machinery, the cogs and wheels working in unison. Itrsquos also a failsafe way of clearing the mind, and finding fresh inspiration. Whenever my husband is stuck for the next sentence, he heads out. The top of every article or chapter he writes should record the tally of miles walked between first word and last.Itrsquos no wonder so many writers have been walkers. Not all were obliged to tramp the hills and roadside every day but many, like Robert Louis Stevenson, recognised the therapeutic benefits. He didnrsquot want to scale the heights, or keep to a strict and demanding schedule. A steady pace was his aim because, ldquoonce you have fallen into an equable stride, it requires no conscious thought from you to keep it up, yet it prevents you from thinking earnestly of anything ..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-enjoy-cairngorms-comfort-armchair","story":"The hotels, bars and restaurants are quiet, the visitors are at home.

factories where parents once worked or churches where grandparents worshipped.Captured in black and white, and with many showing streets remarkably clear of the traffic that would soon come, some , fascinating photographs of Scottish le taken during the s and s have presented Scots with the ultimate lockdown puzzle.Images taken by staff working for the long-defunct Scottish Development Department have been made available online for the first time by Historic Environment Scotland , along with an appeal to the public to turn detective and help identy the houses, streets and businesses they show.They may have their work cut out: the new online archive showcases rural and urban Scotland, from Highland crofts and Orkney farms to large housing estates in Fe, city tenements in Glasgow, unidentied town centre shops with old-fashioned signs and equally old-fashioned looking shoppers.While some may be easy to locate, others are likely to have viewers scratching their heads over where they may be.As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, head of archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember.ldquoSome show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location.Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff. The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued.The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever.Last year alone, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh, and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom.Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ferguson added: ldquoThese archives give a unique perspective on civic planning in the th century including the development and growth of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while the images of excavations showcase the sites that helped archaeologists unlock the secrets of Scotlandrsquos past ndash from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

Consequently, golf courses, tennis and basketball courts will all be able to reopen from Wednesday.Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and \"ticketed outdoor leisure venues\" - where there is a higher risk of close contact - remain off-limits, however.The reopening of such leisure facilities may only be \"fully possible signicantly later\" depending on the reduction in infections, adds the guidance.Downing Street confirmed that, under the new lockdown rules for south of the border, an inidual could meet with one person who was not from their household in an outdoor setting such as a park, provided the two-metre distance rule were observed.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman explained: \"You could go to the park with your household and, whereas at the moment you would have to be exercising, you can do that for leisure.\"So, you could sit down with members of your family or those of you in the same household, you could sunbathe or have a picnic or whatever.

You cant go out with your household, adding one other person to it,\" he added.Phase two from June could see the phased reopening of nurseries and primary schools as well as non-essential shops, the staging of sports events like football matches behind closed doors and the reopening of some public transport.Phase three, which would occur no earlier than July , could see hairdressers reopen as well as some pubs, hotels, places of worship and cinemas, so long as social distancing rules can be applied.Asked about the warning from Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, that even modest changes could have the potential to risk lives, Professor Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos Chief Medical Officer, said the expert group SAGE was recommending the slight easing because there was a ldquolittle bit of room for manoeuvre given the number of infected cases was falling and the infection rate was already below one.\"We are confident the risk of being outdoors, in terms of meeting people, provided it is with social distancing, is signicantly lower than that of indoors.\"We are confident these quite small changes will not have a material effect, on their own, provided people stick to the social distancing and the rules that are there, on increasing the R beyond where we are at the moment.\"He added: \"We are not claiming there are no risks in this but what we think is that they are very small and proportionate to the advantage of overall wellbeing, exercise leading to good health and sustainability.\"The Government document explains how ministers and officials are examining how to enable people to gather in ldquoslightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.It goes on: \"Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.\"Among the new recommended measures is the wearing of face-coverings.It explains that because of increased mobility as more peopleto work the Government is now advising that people should ldquoaim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.The document points out how face-coverings are not intended to help the wearer but protect against any inadvertent transmission of the disease to others.ldquoA face covering is not the same as a facemask such as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers. These supplies must continue to be reserved for those who need it. Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face-coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.Prof Whitty pointed out how there had been scientic debate across many countries on the efficacy of face-coverings and, on balance, SAGE decided there was evidence of a ldquomodest effect in a person, who had the virus without knowing it for two to three days, being able to protect someone . He pointed out the scientic evidence was not strong enough to make the wearing of masks compulsory. He also stressed wearing face-coverings was not an alternative to social distancing.Last month, the Scottish Government recommended face-coverings in restricted areas but at the time the UK Government did not. However, its experts now believe that wearing them can produce a small but positive benefit, particularly in restricting the transmission from an infected person, who might not be showing signs of having the disease."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10306315.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-germany-infection-rate-continues-rise-lockdown-eases","story":"Latest figuresfrom the Robert Koch Instituteshowthat the coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany is now ., up from . the day before and . on Friday.Mondays figure meansthat every patient is infecting at least one other.

If it exceeds one, the virus could rapidly take off again.That is why the Scottish Government is exercising such care and caution.We announced one change to the rules yesterday. If you want to exercise outdoors more than once a day, you can now do so.But otherwise we are asking you to stick with lockdown for a bit longer - so that we can consolidate our progress, not jeopardise it.Except for essential work that canrsquot be done at home, going out for food and medicine, or for exercise - please continue to stay at home.When you do go outside, please stay two metres from other people - and donrsquot meet up with people from other households.Please wear a face coveringyou are in a shop or on public transport. And wash your hands thoroughly and regularly.These measures are essential for now. But we know they cause harm of their own, so we will not keep them in place for longer than necessary.As the infection rate continues to fall, we will gradually relax the restrictions.And we are already making preparations for that.We are working with businesses to produce guidance on safe workplaces.We are working on the changes needed on public transport.And we are talking to teachers and parents about how and when schools can safely .We are doing all of that carefully because it is vital that when we do ask you toto work or to school, you have clarity about what we are asking you to do and also confidence that it is safe.We are also expanding our ability to test people for COVID-, and trace those they have been in contact with. That will be important to control new outbreaks.On all of this, I will keep you informed every step of the way.I want to make sure that as we take each step on the path to recovery, the ground beneath us is as solid as possible. But I will not keep these restrictions in place longer than necessary.As First Minister, I know the impact this has on all of you. And as a citizen, I miss my family too.But I wonrsquot risk unnecessary deaths by acting rashly or prematurely.So I am asking you please, for the moment, to continue to do what you have been doing so responsibly.I also want to say a special thank you to children. Not being at school, or seeing your friends, or hugging your grandparents is really tough.But you have handled it brilliantly.

Wonderfully, Ma Stewart has taken to the Regenerate class with gusto, though shed port de bras me in the face for telling you, and is having a wonderful time learning a new skill despite being isolated at home.I took ballet classes for more than  years and miss them dreadfully so was thrilled to learn that, on a Friday morning, one of my favourite Scottish Ballet dancers, Bethany Kingsley-Garner, was taking a class \"for all ages\".I made an excuse not to be showing up for the morning work Teams video conference and got my leggings on, dug out my old ballet shoes and was there, feet in first position, ready to go.It turned out that \"all ages\" more meant \"for parents and children\" but you know, I had a wonderful time pretending to be a swan and opening up to the sunshine like a spring flower.Its amazing what the body remembers, even after a long time sedentary. Despite it being a class for tots, I could feel my muscles readily moving back into the old, familiar patterns, my big toe drawing the swirl of a ron de jambe on the floor or arms lting into fth position.Its sad to discover my grand battement are more of an extremely pathetic battement but it seems my right hip is giving me gyp. Perhaps all the sitting, who knows.But a hobbling right hip led to the next new indoor exercise discovery. The near-cult like movement of Yoga By Adrienne. Yoga is another love that has fallen by the wayside as work and le took over.I was looking for some hip opener exercises to help ease the pain, seeking out a little something for my neck, stf from hunching over a laptop at my dining table.There she was - Adrienne Mishler. Apparently shes already an international yoga star with millions of devoted YouTube followers. Who knew  Well, as I say millions of people. And no wonder.Shes perfect in a pandemic. No overly dficult, Instagram focused headstands here. \"Try thisyou can,\" she tells me in a first video, \"Maybe youll manage it, maybe you never will.\"Thats the spirit.My yoga mat has become five feet of safe space, with the soothing sound of Adrienne guiding me into a downward dog.I was becoming accustomed to being physically unambitious but now these online tutorials have sparked me back into action.Im almost sad about being allowed back outdoors, away from the safety of the gentle online guidance of Bethany and Adrienne.Its perhaps ironic that one tiny positive is the rediscovery of long lost movement in a lockdown.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions. They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald."},{"url":null,"title":"public-transport-users-told-face-away-one-another-unable-observe-social-distancing","story":"The guidance acknowledges that \"there may be situations where you cant keep a suitable distance from people\" such as on busier services or at peak times.It says: \"In these cases, you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.\"The official advice goes on: \"The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.\"The Government move comes as yet again there have been pictures posted on social media of people on crowded London Underground trains.Matt Hancock, the UK Government Health Secretary, was challenged about the safety of people being crammed \"like sardines\" on the Tube this morning.He told ITVrsquos This Morning: \"Less than one in six people commute on public transport of course, that figure is much bigger in London. People should avoid public transport unless they absolutely have to use it because it is safer when there is fewer people on it.\"He suggested more people should get on a bike to go to work.\"You say not everybody can cycle, thats true, but lots more people can than do and now is actually a good time to start cycling to work because there is hardly any traffic on the roads so its much more pleasant to cycle than in normal times,\" Mr Hancock said.A key worker has said that social distancing was \"impossible to maintain\" on his journey to work on the London Underground this morning.Terry McCarthy, , a supermarket store manager, took a photo at Canada Water at am and shared it to Twitter with the caption: \"And they try to tell us the tube is at % capacity! This is dangerous and putting lives at risk!\"He explained how his place of work was too far away to walk or cycle to.\"Both the  and the train were busier than what it has been the last few weeks. There were too many people in the carriage and social distancing was impossible to maintain,\" added Mr McCarthy.Transport operators in England are being urged to rearrange, remove or limit seating \"to try and ensure social distancing is observed\".This could include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating.Single users of black cabs and minicabs are being advised to sit in the back left-hand seat of taxis.All transport operators have been issued guidance on ensuring stations and services are regularly cleaned.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, who will make a Commons statement on the guidance this afternoon, said: \"Transport operators and staff have been working hard to ensure that people who need to get to work are able to do so, including crucial NHS workers and all those on the front line of the fight against the virus.\"Alongside the cycling and walking revolution we are launching and clear guidance to passengers and operators published today, we can all play our part by following the advice and reducing pressure on public transport.\"If we take these steps, all those who need to use public transport should feel confident that they can do so safely with the space to maintain social distancing as far as possible,\" he added.Passengers south of the border are being advised to \"avoid using public transport where possible\" and should \"instead try to walk, cycle or drive\".People who do travel should be \"thinking carefully about the times, routes and ways you travel\".The guidance recommends:*keeping two metres apart from others wherever possible*wearing a face coveringyou can*using contactless payment where possible*avoiding rush hour travel where feasible*washing or sanitising your hands as soon as possible before and after travel and*following advice from staff and being considerate to others.The new advice follows the announcement of a pound billion package of cycling and walking investment for England that will deliver a ldquogreen revolution in travel, aiming to ease the pressure on public transport services by helping more people than ever choose alternative forms of travel.This includes pound million for local authorities in England to create pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors.The overall expenditure will produce a knock-on windfall for the Scottish Government of around poundm via the Barnett Formula."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmThe furlough scheme, which pays the wages of workers on leave due to coronavirus, has been extended to October, the UK Government chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve things like the “world-class health service” which they benefit from.He added that, when that time comes, #we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews, care workers and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh a bhaintighearna","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.A bheil sibh eòlach air Gleann Eireachd ann an Siorrachd Pheairt  Tha Uisge Eireachd a’ sruthadh troimhe – sin an abhainn a tha a’ dol tro Bhlàr Ghobharaidh.Tha e air creag os cionn na h-aibhne., seo na chanas an t-Suirbhidh Òrdanais anns an Leabhar Ainmean aca: ‘Aig oir a’ bhearraidh, chithear fhathast tobhta tùir # air a bheil Caisteal na Baintighearna Liondsaidh, anns an robh o chionn nan ceudan bhliadhnaichean, nighean a bhuineadh don chinneadh uasal Crawford air a glasadh a-staigh fad a beatha mar thoradh air breith a’ Phàip #’ Agus dè rinn i – a’ Bhaintighearna Liondsaidh a bha seo Seo agaibh an sgeulachd.

of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere’s only so much looking at a blank page on screen that’s possible before you have to admitdefeat.In the absence of any golf, indeed any sports at all, and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction Hunter, rather than just ‘flogging it’, whatever ‘it’ turns out to be, for a £.I’ll head to Vegas, spin Chumlee a great line about my cousin Donald, and cash in on the great-great-grandmother.Memo to self: check the lineage and silence Bill Lawson.Ach, I might even disappear up to Dutch Harbour for a while and see what the fishing’s like with my old pal, Sig Hansen on the ‘Northwestern’.The Barents Sea looks like a doddle compared to Broad Bay, although the weather might require an extra pair of Damart.I might watch Ricky Gervais’ ‘After Le’ again the first time was a bit ‘misty’ in parts.I recommend it to you.In between I’ll do the odd lottery, online naturally, just to add to the suspense when I get ‘lucky’.Lucky is a relative term.The ‘congratulations, you have a winning ticket’ email is one of the tricks le likes to play on us all in its huge panoply of crushing disappointments, dressed up full of promise.I like to leave it a while before checking, spending the £ million carefully, ensuring the family are sorted before I buy my own train.The accumulated £. may require pooling.I won’t let any win ruin my positive, cheerful, disposition.When it comes to big numbers, the latest book, Matt Parker’s ‘Humble Pi’ doesn’t take long to leave you whistling at how unprepared you were to comprehend something as ‘small’ as a trillion.He was asked once to go onto tv to explain when the UK national debt crept up to this figure.Can#t be far past a billion, right Wrong!He explained it thus.A million seconds is nearly  days.A billion seconds is nearly  years.Ok, so now you’re in the ‘ballpark’, aren’t you Nah.A trillion seconds would take us all to the year .Yup,  years into the future.So how long to the end of the lockdown and ‘things’ get back to what’s being called the ‘new normal’ As long as it takes to guarantee the safety of each and every one of us, especially the most vulnerable, should be the answer, but these are strange times.Don’t count the seconds.Count the sunny days and savour each and every one of them.And yes, I know it’s probably snowing this weekend.It’s peat-cutting season.I wasn’t going to mention the coronavirus crisis, but unfortunately it’s caught up with us in a very real and devastating way.No amount of books, tv and fantasy can hide us from harsh reality.It’s nice to digress, but my thoughts are with the families affected in Skye.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

carried out.Highland Labour MSP Rhoda Grant has asked NHS Highland to start daily testing of all staff and residents at Home Farm.In an email to NHS Highland interim chief executive Paul Hawkins, Mrs Grant also urged that concerns over staff movements at the home should be investigated.Mrs Grant has asked Mr Hawkins: “Did the health board know whether staff had been tested before they were moved in, and whether any contact tracing of staff had taken place to ensure staff brought in were not coming from other homes where patients had tested positive for the infectious disease ” reports.Mrs Grant has called on Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to disclose how all separate bits of government advice had been passed on to care homes by the Scottish Government.She added: “I understand the Home Farm Care Home has weak ratings with regard to infection control – was it identied by Health Protection Scotland as one which might need special attention or guidance before the outbreak occurred  If this is the case, what additional action was taken to protect residents ”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron echoed calls for extra testing.He said: “The focus must be on testing care home workers to reassure them that they are free of the disease and to minimise the chances of care homes being infected.“It’s a sad fact that the proportion of deaths from Covid- in care settings in Scotland has been high and, as testing here has been carried out at a relatively low rate, it is right that there should be a great national effort to improve matters.“I believe it would also help to instil confidencethe number of care workers tested was published regularly and I hope that the Scottish Government starts doing that on a more regular basis.”Meanwhile, Skye councillors are urging NHS Highland and Home Farm operators HC One to communicate information to the local community “on a regular and timeous basis”.Local Councillor Calum Munro said: “Everyone is keen to have regular and informative information about the situation in Portree, good information helps us manage a dficult situation”Councillor John Finlayson added: “It is good to hear about the recent testing results have come back for Budhmor and An Acarsaid showing no cases of Coronavirus in these homes at this time.“We need regular updates so that we and the wider community, who have been so supportive right across the island in responding Covid , receive the honesty and transparency we deserve so that we can all understand what is going on.Councillor John Gordon praised the courageous and kind service that the

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

Chris Branniganis working to support the NHS in planning the delivery of personal protection equipmentand mobile Covid- testing centres.He has had to stay away from his young family in Surrey for the last five weeks, as his daughter Hastisuffers from a rare neuro-degenerative condition requiring her to stay in isolation.Cornelia de Lange Syndromecauses children to seriously deteriorate in adolescence, with symptoms including severe mental health challenges like self-harm, mutism, anxiety and depression.There is currently no cure or treatment, but the family - including mum Hengamehand children Amirand Navid- are raising funds for pioneering research into gene therapy which could give Hasti hope.In January, a goal of £, was set to fund initial research of which over £, has been raised so far.The money will pay to develop a #proof of concept# treatment, which could then proceed to clinical trials.Covid- has halted most fundraising events for now, but Hasti has been able to raise £, herself with a cycling challenge.Mr Brannigan said he is now fighting against the clock to give Hasti, and hundreds of others, a chance as the proposed therapy will not be effective in older children.It could be going a lot betterI#m honest, we#ve had to cancel dozens of fundraising events, he said. But the dficult circumstances make the donations we are getting so much more special.I#ve been away from home for five weeks as it was just too risky to bring the virus home unwittingly while we#re trying to shield Hasti.Being away has been really dficult. We celebrated my son#s birthday last month and it was hard not being there for a proper celebration.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChris and Hasti Brannigan before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChris and Hasti Brannigan before the lockdownHe added: In the past when I#ve been on army operations you at least knew your family was safe, but I don#t want to be the reason I#m putting them in danger.Mr Brannigan has been keeping up bedtime stories with his daughter via video call every night, but explaining the reality of Covid- has been hard.I think she understands the wider circumstances but doesn#t really accept why I need to be away. She asks me every night, #Are you coming home today, Daddy # and I have to say no.He is now hoping the latest measures to ease the lockdown in England mean he will be able to work from home safely within weeks.Once the £, total for research has been reached, the family will face another dficult choice. Assuming the research all comes good we can fund the clinical trials ourselves. They are incredibly expensive though and cost millions of pounds, Mr Brannigan said.The other option is that once we have a gene therapy that we know works and is safe, it#s likely that pharmaceutical companies will come forward to purchase the intellectual property rights and run the clinical trials. That is potentially fraught with peril for us though because we would lose control of the timescale, as they#re under no pressure.Also, the potential is that Hasti wouldn#t be included in the trials despite the fact that we#ve done the hard miles to create the gene therapy ourselves. But we#re doing everything we can to give her the best chance.Further information on Hasti#s story is available at www.hopeforhasti.org.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Stormont Executive is to set up a working group to help ensure the smooth travel of airline passengers during the Covid- pandemic. By Mark BainMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Stormont Executive is to set up a working group to help ensure the smooth travel of airline passengers during the Covid- pandemic.It follows the announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that passengers coming into the UK will be required to isolate for two weeks, although those arriving from France and the Republic would be exempt.But officials in the Republic have insisted a similar exemption will not be reciprocated for people travelling to the Republic from Great Britain.Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney told the Executive#s daily Covid- press conference that Stormont has been working closely with London and Dublin over air travel.Conversations were held last week in relation to how this particular issue would and should be addressed. There is an acceptance amongst all the administrations that there is effectively a common travel area between these islands, that#s the appropriate stance to adapt.However, iniduals who would travel into these islands from abroad will then be expected to accept a two week lockdown and isolation period. We have made the point to the British Government that in circumstances where perhaps someone has travelled into Britain from continental Europe or where who may then travel on to a destination in the  counties that their details are shared with authorities in the south in order to maintain a consistency in their approach to dealing with iniduals who should be adhering to a two week isolation.DUP junior minister Gordon Lyons added: There will be a working group set up to ensure the proper exceptions are in place. It is obviously important that the common travel area is maintained and that will require further conversations with our own government and the Irish Government as well.Meanwhile, in the Republic it has emerged that gardai will be given the power to check up on air passengers arriving from overseas. This could include gardai calling to the addresses of passengers to ensure they are self-isolating for two weeks after their arrival.Strict new regulations are being drafted to make it a legal requirement for anyone arriving in the Republic to self-isolate and give the authorities details of where they will be staying.Using emergency legislation to allow gardai to police the new rules is a key proposal in the plans being discussed by senior ministers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They include Cara Doranfrom north Belfast, who for the past six years has been a receptionist at Belfast#s Merchant Hotel, a casualty of the Covid- crisis and now closed along with countless other bars and restaurants.With no idea when she will be back behind her desk in the lobby, Cara was keen to use her free time to make a dference through volunteering.Now for six days a week she is one of the #soup-er heroes# making deliveries throughout the greater Shankill area to the most vulnerable, elderly and those in need.On a typical day Cara packs her car full of deliveries before heading to around  homes, where people of all ages are isolating from the virus.After a few days of being at home when the hotel closed I just knew that I had to do something during this pandemic, Cara said.With all this free time on my hands, I couldn#t just sit about not helping out people in need. I saw an advert on Facebook that the Spectrum Centre were seeking drivers for soup deliveries and got in touch.It#s contact-free work where I deliver the soup and leave it outside the homes, rap the door and then walk away.Cara says the work has been really fulfilling.Everyone is friendly and very appreciative. Some are quite lonely and do like to have a chat, which is fine, and I do.From a mental health point of view, doing this is a great help as it gets you motivated to get up and go out.If I can help out in any way when this is all over, I will stay involved with the centre, Cara added.Meanwhile, Joan Murphyis four weeks into her stint delivering soup with the same group, having been furloughed from her job at the Movie House Cinema at Yorkgate, where she has worked for  years.I locked the cinema doors for the last time on St Patrick#s Day and it was a really weird feeling not knowing when the projectors would be back on again, Joan said.After two weeks of pacing the floor I knew that I needed to be doing something and started following some community pages on social media who needed drivers for delivery.Giving up a few hours for three days each week really isn#t that much, but you get to know those you meet on the run and your fellow volunteers.I#m loving being a part of this as I#m getting a lot out of it and it gives your week some structure too. Plus I#m getting to know parts of Belfast I had never been to before.Tens of thousands of food packages are also being delivered to those who are shielding, the financially vulnerable or people who may be experiencing dficulties physically accessing food.Numerous local voluntary groups are involved, including Cregagh Community Association in east Belfast, and it#s where Joanne Snoddenhelps to deliver  food and essential items parcels every Friday.The mum-of-two was a children#s play worker with Venture Kids after school club and was keen to help others in whatever way she could.It gives me a reason to get up, dressed and get out there, Joanne explained.We put the parcels together in Mount Merrion Church and then normally ide the runs up so you take about six each.Last Friday when I dropped off a parcel with one wee man he just burst into tears he was so happy.My daughter was in the car at the time and she asked me why he was crying, so I had to explain it was because he was thankful as he can#t get out himself.This has also been a chance for her to learn the importance of helping others.Elsewhere Maura O#Brienfrom Glengormley was previously an administrator with a construction firm for over three years before being furloughed on April .Now she is using her free time to do shopping for an elderly couple who are self-isolating after registering with the Volunteer Now website.It#s a chance to give something back because initially I felt a sense of guilt that I was still being paid to do nothing whilst others are working hard on the front line, Maura said.I phone the couple every week, get their order for groceries the next day, do the shopping and then leave it on their porch.At this stage I know their shopping list better than my own.They are a lovely couple and you could easily sit and talk to them all day on the phone.I#m glad to be doing this as I can#t get to see my own parents back in Co Tyrone at the moment.You#d love to be able to do more but every little helps.I#d urge anyone considering doing something to help others so just get out there and do it, she added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tomorrow marks both International Nurses Day and the th anniversary of Nightingale#s birth. Her image and a message of thanks will be projected from Parliament on to her place of work, St Thomas# Hospital, while similar projections will happen at the British Embassy in Rome and the Italian Federation of Nurses. Thousands of former nurses have come out of retirement to help the health service deal with the coronavirus outbreak and thousands of students are also helping by working in extended clinical placements.Health Minister Robin Swann said: International Nurses Day is particularly important this year not only because it is the th anniversary of Florence Nightingale#s birth, but because of the exceptional work of nurses in our response to coronavirus.I want to thank each and every one of our incredible nurses who are on the front line in the battle against the greatest public health crisis of our time.I know how much the public#s support and the clapping that has been ringing out from doorsteps every Thursday has buoyed our health and social care workers. It would mean a great dealpeople once again showed their gratitude by shining a light for nurses this Tuesday.First Minister Arlene Foster said: How fitting it is that  has been designated the Year of the Nurse and Midwe, because this is the year that we will remember the enormous contribution of our nurses and healthcare staff in the fight against Coronavirus.Florence Nightingale#s dedication, skill and transformative care of patients is synonymous with the values and expertise so evident in the modern day nursing profession in Northern Ireland.This Tuesday, on International Nurses Day, let us recognise their incredible dedication, their professionalism, and their enormous personal sacrice for the good of us all.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said: Our nurses are a shining light. While this emergency situation has brought their contribution to the fore, we must recognise the importance of their role in caring for us, and our families, throughout our lives.When we come out the other side of this crisis, one of the positives we can take from it is ensuring that our nurses and other health and social care staff get the recognition they deserve.A range of local landmarks, monuments and council buildings will be illuminated blue, the colour of the nurse, tomorrow evening.Professor Greta Westwood, CEO of the Florence Nightingale Foundation, said: Florence Nightingale, herself a trailblazer during her career, would have been proud at the way nurses have followed in her footsteps as pioneers and leaders in the fight against the pandemic.

Peter Marley has been using the restrictions on movement to work on a series of portraits.#Sociable Distance# is the working title of his special project, an ongoing series of photographs captured during the Covid- pandemic.He explained how he has been using his daily walk to make images that create a time capsule of this unusual period in which we find ourselves.I#ve been making portraits with friends, neighbours and strangers, all from a responsible distance, he said.And it has been a great way to stay connected to a community whilst documenting the much quieter streets of Belfast.Peter , from Glenarf, Co Antrim, is married to -year-old Zjena, a costume designer who is originally from Croatia. They are expecting their first child.He normally works in the TV and film industry, but as that has come to global standstill he has turned his hand to this innovative challenge.To date his series comprises around  pieces and has gained momentum over the last few weeks as people have started to learn of his unique project.But although he suggested that he may hit , he stressed that he never really works with a target in mind, adding: That adds more pressure to how I work and makes it more goal-orientated as opposed to being an organic process.Peter said: I respond to people getting in touch with me but I also chat to neighbours and strangers to give the project a little spontaneity.It allows me to meet people who aren#t in my immediate friend circle or extended neighbour group.A few would also be the unemployed film community, it#s almost like checking in on them, just to have a chat, and then quite a few of them would be strangers who got in touch with me after exposure of the project online, or strangers I found in their garden enjoying the sun or at the doorstep.Having worked on portrait projects before, Peter said the idea for this one came from him checking in on friends who where nearby but hadn#t really had anyone to chat with.I#ve done similar things to document changes going on around the country or strange events whenever they pop up, he said.So this was almost to create a time capsule for something that doesn#t happen too often where people are instantly changing their day to day habits.Everything like shopping has gone from a daily convenience to a weekly extravagance.People have been very responsive and very quick to change their habits, from getting coffee on the street to preparing at home. Even thought the portraits were a way of making sure friends and family were okay, it was also a way of documenting how quickly our local community had changed.Hopefully that will be a record for .Perhaps the most striking thing for Peter has been the positivity of the people he has encountered on the way.There is an undercurrent of concern and worry but beyond that people are generally looking out for each other, he said.Some are running errands for their older neighbours. There#s a real compassion within the community.It#s warm and fantastic to see. If I had been told to imagine a dystopian future where people were wearing masks I would never have thought it was going to be so polite.Peter said that once the series is complete he hopes to hold an exhibition locally and produce a photobook of his work.My projects tend to culminate in an isolated photobook of portraits, he said.But this time I#ve also tried to include street photography just to give a wider context.And because of the phenomenal weather we#ve been having the portraits have an almost too positive a hue so I#m including deserted places, a lot of the signage relating to Covid- and the amount of discarded plastic gloves to give it a wider context for  and quarantine - otherwise it#s just a lot of people having barbecues.The main thing is to document what#s happening during lockdown and create a record of it.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before.

She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Dermot Morrow will taking part in Australia, Lee Kennedy in Canada, Rory McEldowney in New York and Jenni Ross-Boyle was promoting it from outside Buckingham Palace.All runners will be following routes as close to their homes as possible to follow the social distancing guidelines. The times and distances are logged and passed back to Karen and Brian Oacuteg for totting up the progress.“Yeah, everyone is involved now, but it is only the senior teams who are running through the night, we want to keep it as safe as possible. Everyone  will be running from .am and finishing up around .pm,” Karen continues.At the time of publication, the club had raised pound,.“We have been doing very well. At the start, we have set the target of two grand and weve more than doubled that with a week to go.”Looking ahead to this weekend, the club is appealing to as many as possible to get involved.“Its a case of the more the merrier between the hours of am to pm, you dont have to be from Kilrea –you want to run on behalf of someone who died from any chest, heart and stroke related issues. If you dont want to run, you can walk or jog,” Karen concluded.All the proceeds are going towards the NI Chest, Heart and Stroke, a cause in the clubs thoughts.Last June, they lost U manager Brian Calvert to a sudden heart attack and also prominent clubman Tommy Donaghy recently passed away. googletag.cmd.push All donations, no matter how small are greatly appreciated.

The vast majority of the people across the UK have taken the official advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. googletag.cmd.push People are hungry for accurate information about how to protect themselves, but following the official advice and ignoring the swirling mass of uninformed conjecture, opinion and speculation is not always easy. However, there are ways to identy who to trust, and who to ignore. Similarly, there are ways to identy the small but persistent group of unscrupulous iniduals who have decided that they want to use the pandemic to try to make financial gain through fraud. There have been a lot of examples of  information and attempts at fraud. For example, holding your breath for  seconds is not a test for coronavirus, gargling water for  seconds is not a cure and phone masts cannot cause coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push There have also been comments and suggestions from people claiming to be medical experts who are simply not. Fraudsters will use any opportunity - including the current pandemic - to try to trick people out of their money. There have been examples of fake texts claiming to be sent from the Government alerting people they have received a fine for breaking social distancing rules. Some people and even businesses have been tricked into paying for protective face masks and hand sanitizers from companies that don’t exist There have also been messages from criminals sending messages to trick people into thinking they are getting genuine offers of financial support from the government. At the same time, hackers are stepping up attempts to access people’s networks and steal their log in details and passwords. However,you take sensible precautions, you can quickly spot signs of fraud and identy the facts from the fiction. Sharing the right information could save lives.

Ensure you are using the latest software, apps and operating systems on your phones, tablets and laptops and update them regularly. Andyou get an unexpected or suspicious email or text message, don’t click on the attachment or message. Don’t be afraid to challenge messages and messengers. It’s okay to refuse or ignore requests for your money or detailsyou are suspicious - only criminals will try to rush or panic you. The police and banks will never ask you to withdraw money or transfer it to a dferent account. Neither will they ask you to reveal your full banking password or PIN. You can check that requests are genuine by using a known number or email address to contact organisations directly. Andyou think you have fallen victim to a scam, then contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. You can report suspicious texts by forwarding the original message to , which spells SPAM on your keypad. SHARE CAUTION Be careful what you share, because things are not always what they seem online.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Foyle Martina Anderson said several caravan owners have spoken to her about having to pay fees despite not being able to use their caravans. “It was the right decision to close caravan parks, given the obvious dangers of people staying together in such close proximity during this pandemic, said Ms Anderson. “It is however unfair to expect all caravan owners, many of whom have seen their incomes affected, to continue to pay a pitch fee while they have no access to their caravan. googletag.cmd.push “Park owners need to take into account the circumstances that many caravan owners are facing during these dficult times. “They should therefore consider reducing or waiving annual and partial fees given that owners are unlikely to be able to access their caravans during the summer months at least. “Rather that park owners collaborating to force caravan owner to pay their site fees regardless of the impact of this deadly pandemic, they should be uniting in their call on the Irish Government to put financial support in place to ensure that neither caravan owners or park owners are penalised as a result of this pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Over the last month, hundreds of messages of support have flooded into local SuperValu and Centra stores, as customers pay tribute to the huge efforts local retailers have been making to keep food on people’s tables right across Northern Ireland. These heart-warming messages have lted the spirts of hardworking local retailers and their teams, as they work tirelessly to keep shelves stocked and queues moving. Now, SuperValu and Centra are planning to pay this positivity back. The retail brands are asking customers in Derry to nominate their local store hero – the people that are going above and beyond to help their local communities during the Covid- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push For every nomination, SuperValu and Centra will donate pound to their long-standing charity partner, Action Cancer. With fundraising events cancelled and Action Cancer retail shops closed as a result of the Covid- Pandemic, the charity needs to raise vital funds, so it can provide le-saving cancer prevention, detection and support services to those most in need as soon as services can get back up and running.  Launching the new initiative, Desi Derby, Marketing Director for SuperValu and Centra in NI said: “Our frontline workers are going above and beyond and doing a fantastic job – making sure shelves are stocked, delivering to those in need and ensuring customers stay safe when in store. googletag.cmd.push We have been overwhelmed by the dferent messages of thanks and appreciation that have come in from our customers whether on social media or via our customer services team and so we wanted to recognise this in the first instance. “Those same frontline colleagues also work tirelessly every year to raise money for Action Cancer and asked how we could do more when social distancing prevents the normal fundraisers such as in-store cycles and coffee mornings. So, we decided to bring the recognition of our colleagues and our commitment to support our charity partner together. We are now asking customers to take the time to nominate the person in your local store that has made a real dference. Andat this time of crisis, when our charity partner Action Cancer is seeing a substantial drop in income, being able to help support them too is extremely important to us.” People can nominate their local store hero on the SuperValu or Centra Facebook page or by emailingsupervalu.localhero@musgrave.ieor centra.localhero@musgrave.ie.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information.In particular they want to hear from anyone who was in the Church Avenue area during the early hours of Monday morning and witnessed any suspicious activity.Police also want to hear from anyone who knows the whereabouts of the missing Peugeot car.SEAFORDE ndash A Seaforde woman has been appointed to chair Northern Irelandrsquos conservation

that as chairwoman she wants to make the council more open and has invited the public to contact the council through its secretariat.ldquoIf people want to contact us with their ideas they can do so by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs Browne, who has an OBE for her work in the commercial environment sector, said: ldquoThe statutory duty of the council is to look after nature reserves, such as the Quoile Pondage and other areas of natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair,

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down. The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains the best solution for the local area.Confirmation that Phoenix Gas is carrying out the work in the heart of the resort when it is anticipated that there will be less traffic, has been welcomed by two local politicians, South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said he appreciates that for many, the ongoing roadworks across East Down ldquohas been a complicated time, but is pleased that the company is now able to carry out additional works in the Newcastle area, much earlier than planned.Cllr Devlin said that while many aspects of le are currently dficult

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help.

We’ve been able to make a lot of changes that will be very positive and I think will become embedded in practice after this is all an awful memory. It’s incredible how the red tape has disappeared and has been replaced by a ‘can do’ attitude throughout the ious levels of the service.”What struck me most about her response was that it was very similar to what I’ve heard from others over the past few weeks. Indeed, I’ve been both surprised and heartened by the ‘can do’ attitude of so many of those who’ve found themselves on the frontline for weeks on end. For years we’ve taken these people for granted always expecting them to be there when we need them and then being surprised when we realise how much they’ve always been doing for us on a daily basis.It is worth bearing in mind – because it says a great deal about pre-crisis attitudes – that just a few months ago criticism of the NHS, of waiting lists, of missed appointments, of infections acquired during hospital stays , of suddenly cancelled operations, of crowded A and Es and of consultants not being available for months on end, was re. An increase in home working is an almost inevitable consequence of the coronavirus pandemic \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It took a crisis of this magnitude to make people realise the value of the NHS and it took a crisis of this magnitude for politiciansto realise how brilliantly, speedily and bravely the NHS was able to rise to this challenge. In a column for the News Letter a couple of weeks ago I expressed a fear that a key lessonfrom the crisis – the need for specic changes and increased funding for the NHS – would be forgotten once people believed le had ed to normal. Let’s be honest, there’s not much point in clapping todaywe cop out of the economic consequences tomorrow is there  Sadly, I still think that’s what’s likely to happen.I think it’s also likely that increasing numbers will remain working from home full-time. A lot of businesses have realised that it’s not necessary to have people driving, bussing, cycling or getting a train to work, just to sit in an office for hours on end. A computer or laptop works just as well at home. Meetings are easily arranged through Skype and Zoom. Staff can work in a way that suits them best. Flexi work becomes easier, not least because offices don’t need to be kept open from am to pm. Computer technology has already created paperless offices and it was almost inevitable that peopleless offices wouldn’t be far behind.What we’ve seen across the world since January has been the test-driving of a new way of running businesses and running our personal lives. Again, it has been heartening to see how well we’ve all adapted how so many of us have realised that it is possible to do things dferently and maybe even do them better. I was listening to an interview with someone who has spent almost four hours every day commuting to an office in the centre of London to sit at a computer at a desk because, “well, that’s just the way it has been done for years. When this ends a lot of us, with the firm’s blessing, will continue to work from home”.There is an advertisement on the back of last week’s The Economist: ‘Tradition is history. Disruption is the law of tomorrow. The rules of business and society have changed. % of jobs that will exist in  haven’t been invented yet. How will you embrace the opportunities  Discover what you can do with the law of tomorrow, today...’. I’m old enough to have already seen a huge change in working and types of work in my letime and I’m now going to see another huge change. People shouldn’t be scared. Societal upheaval is normal following a great crisis or change . This health crisis has already made us reassess a number of the fundamentals of our everyday lives and how we live them. So yes, there will be consequences and changes: in how we live our lives and in how we work. Our welfare state – with the NHS at its heart – is probably the single most important consequence to follow the VE Day celebrations in . As a nation, we knew that we wanted change.Certain types of crises can be predicted and war-gamed. It’s absolutely certain, for example, that there will be new economic collapses, political upheavals and pandemicseach of which will result in sweeping changes and new ways of doing things. There may even be a world war . All of these eventualities can be thought about, computer-modelled and tested. What we cannot test is the psychological impact on the millions of iniduals who will bear the brunt of the impact.But even the experts didn’t predict that the two minutes silence on VE Day would happen under lockdown conditions. No one had war-gamed that possibility. Anything and everything can change: and change without warning. For young people that’s the most important lesson to take from this crisis.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Wersquove got the capacity to do it.Matthew went on to describe the atmosphere at Llandough Hospital.ldquoWersquore both in Penarth and wersquove lived here all our lives. Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We’ve seen some retailers doing delivery numbers they thought they’d be doing in eight years’ time.“But there’s a big, big thing here - there are people out there, disabled, elderly, and we’re asking the public to think before they click. Quite simply, delivery slots should be for the most vulnerable in society.”Instead the public should either get their own groceriesor get click-and-collects.The whole surge means that “here in Northern Ireland our retailers are hiring proportionately... some are permanent contracts, some are temporary”.He said they were “hiring for attitude, and training for skill” - meaning people with few qualications can still find roles in the supermarkets.He also said that “one of the laziest  narratives out there is that retailers are making a killing”. Rather, their margins have been squeezed by people buying cheaper ‘own brand’ goods instead of treating themselves.Lastly, he voiced “pride” in how day-to-day staff are handling themselves in the crisis, adding there is a “zero tolerance” approach to people shouting and becoming confrontationalasked to socially distance themselves.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
