However, less grisly numbers from the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine suggested a 50 per cent rise could lead to 4,000 per day. It came as ministers revealed teenagers could be offered jabs as authorities battle to bring the outbreaks under control, with one pharmacy in Sefton offering walk-in jabs for anyone over 20 today. Ten million vulnerable Britons are also being fast-tracked for their second Covid dose over fears the new strain could spark a deadly third wave.And the Independent Sage group today said: \u0027In the light of the new variant, we consider that any increase of mixing in indoor spaces (whether domestic or commercial) to be highly inadvisable, particularly in areas with already proven high levels of B.1.617.2. \u0027Accordingly, local directors of public health should have the discretion to determine when the relaxation of measures can safely occur. \u0027Additionally, indoor commercial spaces should only be allowed to reopen if they can maintain adequate social distancing and have proper ventilation, with a priority program of inspection developed in co-operation with the Health and Safety Executive.\u0027Earlier, top infectious disease expert Professor Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, warned the June end of lockdown will be \u0027in doubt\u0027 if the variant causes a surge in serious illness, threatening to send the Government\u0027s unlocking plans into chaos. Ministers are so far resisting calls to slow the roadmap, insisting the current vaccines roll-out is able to cope. PHE Covid variant expert Professor Nick Loman, from Birmingham University, said the Indian variant\u0027s effect on vaccines is \u0027not particularly concerning\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Under fives forgetting play toys shoes early learning workers say","story":"Share this article \u0027Proper funding would enable the targeted interventions needed to improve children\u0027s personal, social and emotional development alongside their physical development, which many respondents noted have suffered as a result of being cut off from their friends and opportunities to play and explore.\u0027Given the proven link between investment in early years and better educational and social outcomes, especially for the most disadvantaged children, a failure to invest now would be unforgivable.\u0027On Friday, the Department for Education (DfE) encouraged all state schools in England with a reception class to apply for resources and training as part of its £8 million early years catch-up programme.It is hoped the scheme will raise the outcomes in Reception-age children\u0027s early language, communication and speech skills.Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said: \u0027We know the first years of a child\u0027s life can be the most formative, which is why this Government is making it a priority to make sure all children have the best start in life.\u0027Speaking and communicating with confidence sets a child up for success in life, so it\u0027s vital that we support children to grow in confidence with these skills - especially those for whom English is not their first language or who have been more isolated during the pandemic than their peers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"US Navy pilots saw UFOs coast Virginia frequently got used them","story":"Share this articleFormer Navy pilot says flight crews observed UFOs off Atlantic Coast \u0026quotevery day for at least a couple years\u0026quot - CBS News2 Navy Airmen and an Object That ¿Accelerated Like Nothing I¿ve Ever Seen¿ - The New York TimesWill The New York Times Ever Stop Reporting on UFOs? | WIREDOpinion | Even if You Think Discussing Aliens Is Ridiculous, Just Hear Me Out - The New York TimesPentagon Report Details ¿Difficult to Explain¿ UFO Sightings"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a1e5582f4afcd4b36a6d373d9fce09c643f4a3/0_2811_3731_2239/master/3731.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c834b8e434b857c96a126bae63b4ee9c","title":"newcastle united v manchester city premier league live","story":"On Scott Carson’s debut: ““We are incredibly happy for him,” he says. “He is an important player for us. He is a real leader and today was an exceptional day to let him play.” On his hat-trick hero Ferran Torres: ““Incredible numbers and goals in his first season in the Premier League,” says Pep. “He is so young and clinical. He is a guy brought as a winger but maybe we have to think as a striker. He is a good player.”“Overall our attacking play was good on the counter attack and we just weren’t quite good enough on the night. The biggest compliment I can pay them is that it’s difficult to set up against them. There are large periods where you don’t get a kick because they’re so good in possession.” “I try to improve day by day and also try to learn from my team-mates and my manager. I try to keep improving and getting ready for the Champions League final.” Newcastle were unlucky not to double their lead when Jonjo Shelvey thumped a free-kick off the woodwork, but soon found themselves behind after Joao Cancelo and Ferran Torres scored in quick succession. Just before half-time, Joelinton restored parity for Newcastle after VAR interceded to give them a thoroughly deserved penalty for a Nathan Ake foul on the Brazailian. Newcastle won another penalty in the second half for a Kyle Walker foul on Joe Willock, who pulled rank on Joelinton and took the spot-kick. It was saved by surprise debutant Scott Carson but Willock was quickest to the follow up and put his side ahead again. Newcastle’s hopes of victory were cruelly dashed by another two sublime strikes from Ferran Torres, who scored his first Premier League hat-trick and walked off with the match ball. Even though they’re losing, that policy has been remarkably successful and yielded great idends: a corner that led to a goal, two penalties that led to goals and a free-kick that led to Jonjo Shelvey hitting the post, among other dangerous attacks. Thomas Tuchel will be watching with interest. They almost doubled their lead when Jonjo Shelvey thumped a free-kick off the cross-bar, only for City to respond with a quick-fire double courtesy of a deflected Joao Cancelo shot followed by an audacious flick from Ferran Torres. The last word of the half went to Newcastle, however, with Joelinton winning and scoring a penalty that was awarded on the back of yet another excellent attack on the break from the home side.

She added: “What extra measures are they going to put in place to safeguard us?”Though Johnson did not announce a local lockdown for Bolton, Greenhalgh fears that the district could still be subject to tighter restrictions. He said: “Yes, our rates of the Indian variant are going up, but while hospitalisations remain low and all evidence points to the effectiveness of the vaccine , the administration’s message to Government is ‘do not lock us down.

And our hospitality is left struggling again, and on its knees. “More targeted vaccines please and allow us to re-open.”  “But they don’t change the assessment of step three... the overall numbers across the country remain low and quite flat. “What we’re saying is that the public need to be aware of this variant.”He adds that in a few weeks we will know a lot more.  He adds that he realises today’s conference is “slightly disappointing” due the recent news of the new variant, as well as it posing “a real risk of disruption to our plans”. “But it is also possible that we could still be on the right track.”He added this is why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised and there are “very strong aims” to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant.The response will include surge testing, mobile testing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be “targeted new activity” in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites.He added it is important that people in the areas seeing spikes recognise there is an “extra risk, extra disruption, a threat of disruption to progress caused by this new variant”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/314c712bc13a9f4048b8118c96d02056f2281967/0_440_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c06557c05e2824d53c56d5c2617cbdf9","title":"from using unexpected tools to practical prepping advice how to nail diy with tiktok","story":"As a man of cineastic pretences, I own a projector – or a “big telly” as I like to call it – but since moving, it’s been languishing in a box. Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

The San Diego Humane Society’s law enforcement ision confirmed it was conducting the investigation of Cox, who has made several appearances at lecterns with his ursine companion, Tag, wandering behind him. The stunt has drawn condemnation from animal rights groups and state lawmakers. “Gone should be the days when wild animals were treated as toys or props,” said People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, adding that “dangerous wild animals” should not be part of publicity grabs. Ben Hueso, a San Diego Democratic representative, said a 2019 law barring the use of most animals in circuses should apply, in “spirit”, to Cox’s campaign. Cox defended the treatment of the bear. “Every care was taken to ensure Tag’s comfort and safety with the approval of several government agencies. California needs beastly change and that may ruffle some feathers of leftwing activists,” the campaign said in a statement, sticking firmly to Cox’s animal theme – he has positioned himself as the “beast” to Gavin Newsom’s “beauty” and is demanding “beastly” behavior via website, voteforthebeast, and his Twitter account, @beastjohncox. Tarrio, based in Miami, Florida, was approved for an initial loan of $7,750 on 30 March, and a succeeding loan for the same amount on 16 April. The loans were issued to Henry Tarrio, an anglicized form of his name which he has used on other occasions. The Proud Boys began as an organization protesting against political correctness and boosting their idea of masculinity and grew into a rightwing group that embraced street fighting. Earlier this year, Canada named it as a terrorist entity. It is seen as having played an important role in the 6 January attack on the Capitol in Washington DC. In the loan documentation, which was obtained by the news non-profit ProPublica, after a Freedom of Information Act battle with the Small Business Administration, Tarrio is described as an independent contractor, working in the “Security Systems Services” industry, but the document names no associated business entity. Additional information provided to the  by ProPublica shows that the street address on the loan application is associated with both Tarrio and one of the LLCs for which he is named as an officer in Florida state records. Those records show Tarrio as an officer in a number of inactive LLCs, including “SPIE Security LLC”, “Fund The West LLC” and “Proud Boys LLC”. In a questionnaire he completed for the Ballotpedia website in the course of an abortive 2020 congressional run, Tarrio described himself as the proprietor of “several companies that were involved in the surveillance and security industry”. However, Tarrio was not found to be a licensed security officer in a search of Florida state records. Speaking of the atrocities that Palestinians face, she questioned the US government’s “unconditional support” of Israel. “The fight for Black lives and the fight for Palestinian liberation are interconnected,” said Bush, a former Black Lives Matter organizer, who spoke about a Palestinian American Ferguson activist. In a New York Times op-ed, Sanders urged politicians to recognize the human rights of Palestinians. The Vermont senator’s appeal comes after Biden said “Israel has the right to defend itself,” following a conversation with Netanyahu this week.  Sanders drew parallels between the Black Lives Matter movement in the US and the struggles of Palestinian activists: As my colleague Erum Salam reported this week, Palestinian activists say they are heartened by the support of progressive politicians, like Sanders:  Trump had announced the order at last year’s Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore.

Cheney was ousted as House GOP chair and replaced with New York representative Elise Stefanik over her refusal to endorse Trump’s “big lie” that the election was stolen from him.  “It was a vote based on policy, based on substance and in terms of the kinds of policies he put forward that were good for the country. But I think it’s fair to say that I regret the vote,” she told ABC’s Jonathan Karl.  Cheney also said that House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who spoke with Trump on 6 January, should testify before a commission on that day’s events. According to representative Jamie Herrera Beutler, a Republican of Washington, McCarthy asked Trump to call off his supporters. Trump reportedly responded: “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” Cheney has been defiant – doubling down on her position that loyalty to Trump is not the best way forward for the party. Critics are dubious of her rhetoric the sanctity of elections, however, given her unwillingness to vote for or support legislation to prevent voter suppression.

Gohmert is not alone in his defense of those who stormed the Capitol. Republican representatives have downplayed the attack, saying that it was not an insurrection. David Cicilline, a Democratic representative from Rhode Island, has started to push for the censure of three other House members who have denied the severity of the attack. The attack on the Capitol led to five deaths and millions of dollars in property damage. Despite strong sentiments from some Republican House members, the chamber’s homeland security committee agreed to a bipartisan commission that will analyze the happenings of the insurrection and provide recommendations on how future attacks can be prevented.Tanden, a longtime ally to Hillary Clinton and president of liberal think tank Center for American Progress, received criticism for tweets attacking members of both parties once Biden announced she was his pick to lead OMB. Multiple Republicans and Joe Manchin, a key moderate Democratic swing vote, said they would oppose her nomination. Tanden withdrew from her nomination in March following the backlash.  One of Tanden’s duties as a senior adviser will be to launch a review of the US Digital Service, which provides IT services to federal agencies, according to CNN.  “We encouraged customers to follow the guidance of health officials, including, as appropriate, CDC guidelines that advise customers who are fully vaccinated are not required to wear masks while shopping,” the company said on its website Friday. Employees will still be required to wear masks.  Some states such as New Jersey and New Jersey still have their mask mandates in place, but state leaders have said they are reviewing their policies after the change in guidance.More than $500m in the bill will go toward measures to improve security on the Hill, including new fencing, security sensors and cameras in Capitol buildings and offices. The bill also allocates funding for a “Quick Reaction Force” and body cameras for Capitol police officers.  “The needs are urgent, so it is imperative we swiftly pass this legislation to protect the Capitol and those who work and visit here,” said House appropriations chair Rosa DeLauro, who introduced the bill.  Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector, has pleaded guilty to paying a 17-year-old girl for sex, introducing her to others who also “engaged in commercial sex acts” and providing her with drugs. Other people involved were not specified in the documents, though Gaetz is allegedly one of the people who was involved with the girl. Gaetz has denied the allegations and said that people are trying to “recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends”.  Greenberg also admitted to other crimes, including identity theft and defrauding the federal government. He faces 12 years in prison, though the justice department could file a motion for a shorter sentence if his cooperation results in the prosecution of others involved. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said he believes an infrastructure should cost between $600bn and $800bn at most, meaning Republicans and Democrats have a lot to negotiate over in the coming weeks. Republicans are expected to offer up a counter proposal next week. Stay tuned for more live updates. Gavan Fitzsimons, a business professor at Duke University, told the Times that copycat posters are likely trying to get potential voters to subconsciously associate the candidate with Ocasio-Cortez.  “What happens cognitively is it shines a light in your head,” she said. “Essentially what they are doing is borrowing from all the work she has done on the progressive side of the Democratic Party”.  Scott Wong, the reporter, said that Nick Dyer, a spokesperson for Green, approached Swalwell and said, “Biden says you can take off your mask”. Swalwell apparently responding, “You don’t tell me what to fucking do!”  Commenting on the confrontation, Swalwell said he “told the bully what I thought of his order” and “I regret I wasn’t more explicit”.  The incident speaks to the tension between House Republican and Democrats that have been taking place of the last few days as Republicans criticize the Democrats for keeping mask requirements, while Democrats point out that many Republican members have not been vaccinated. Greene confronted representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday, shouting questions at Ocasio-Cortez about why she supports antifa and Black Lives Matter, which she called “terrorist” groups.  “You don’t care about the American people,” Green reportedly shouted. “Why do you support terrorists and antifa?”  Reports say Ocasio-Cortez, who was walking when confronted by Greene, turned around once and threw up her hands in an exasperated motion in response.  CNN also uncovered a since-deleted video of Greene taunting Ocasio-Cortez in February 2019, talking through a mail slot on the representative’s door.  “You need to stop being a baby and stop locking your door and come out and face the American citizens that you serve,” Greene said through the slot as associates around her, which included a conservative livestreamer who took part in the Capitol insurrection, laughed.  At one point in the video, Greene calls Ocasio-Cortez “crazy eyes. Crazy eyes. Nutty. Cortez,” and mispronounces her last name.  In response to the provocations, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN that Greene is “deeply unwell”.  Ocasio-Cortez’s office said that she has asked House leadership to take steps to ensure that Congress is “a safe, civil place for all members”. ’s Oliver Milman has more in a new report on a young Republican congressman who’s telling his party that the issue is nonpartisan.

High schools and colleges across Lancashire are being advised by directors of public health to keep face masks in class until June 21 due to the spread of the “variant of concern”. Bolton and Bury councils are asking secondary schools and colleges to keep face coverings in place until further notice following a surge in cases. A government spokesperson said: “The prime minister has set out the measures needed to tackle the new variant of concern. “In line with our plans published earlier this week to address variants of concern in education, we have also agreed with directors of public health that face coverings will remain in place in Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Lancashire and Sefton. “We are continuing to work closely with local authorities in these areas.”Tarrio, based in Miami, Florida, was approved for an initial loan of $7,750 on 30 March, and a succeeding loan for the same amount on 16 April. The loans were issued to Henry Tarrio, an anglicised form of his name which he has used on other occasions. PPP loans were first issued under the Cares Act in 2020, under the Trump administration, as a stimulus measure to an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. In updated guidance published on its website, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the named visitors can attend two at a time or separately. The visitor figure does not include babies and pre-school children, so young families can visit a care home without exceeding the limit, as long as they do not breach rules on indoor gatherings. To limit the infection risk, care home residents can not have more than two visitors in a day, PA reports. Residents with special care needs may chose to nominate an essential carer as one of their five visitors. The carer will be exempt from the two visitors-a-day limit. Named visitors should be regularly tested, wear appropriate personal protective equipment and maintain social distancing, the DHSC said. Physical contact should be kept to a minimum, it said, although visitors and residents can hold hands as long as they are aware of the increased risk of Covid-19 transmission. Other close physical contact like hugging is still banned. Brazil has registered more than 15.5 million cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 432,628, Reuters reports. Bogota’s mayor echoed that warning, saying the capital had on Thursday reported its second-highest number of new cases and highest number of deaths since the pandemic began. “I don’t know what more to say, to warn, to beg, to plead,” Claudia Lopez said in a Twitter message late on Thursday that urged people to stick to social distancing rules. Lopez later announced she was infected and would self-isolate. The pressure on ICUs in the capital “is worrying”, the government said on Thursday, adding that patients would be transferred by air to other cities. It brings the overall tallies to 2,377,995 infections and 220,159 deaths.  Shortly after the vaccine became available, UK health officials advised that the second dose should be given 12 weeks after the first to allow more people to get protected by a first dose early on.  In a new paper seen by Reuters and expected to appear on medRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers found that among 175 people ages 80 to 99, those who got their second dose at 12 weeks had antibody responses that were 3.5 times higher than those who got it after three weeks.  Antibodies are only one part of the immune system, and vaccines also generate T cells that fight infections.  The peak T cell responses were higher in the group with a three-week interval between doses, and the authors cautioned against drawing conclusions on how protected iniduals were based on which dosing schedule they received."},{"url":null,"title":"academic on 154 000 salary with no work to do accuses president of maynooth","story":"Maynooth University president Prof Philip Nolan, who is also chairman of Nphet’s modelling group on Covid-19.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe The Portobello Plaza in Dublin is being closed this weekend and gardaí will be mounting an operation to prevent large crowds gathering there over the weekend.Dublin City Council last month urged people to stop gathering at the plaza to drink as antisocial behaviour and littering had been an increasing problem, with many residents complaining to the council and Garda.In recent weeks gardaí have stepped up patrols in the area and confiscated alcohol being consumed in public. However, the council has now decided to close the plaza this weekend. The decision will be reviewed next week, it said.Portobello Plaza is located in Dublin’s south inner city on the banks of the Grand Canal and has proven a popular gathering location since the pandemic resulted in pubs being closed.The council said it “regrets” the decision and urged people not to come to the plaza as a Garda operation would be in place to keep it closed and clear.“Dublin City Council is very aware of the importance of public spaces in recent times but some behaviour at this location in recent weeks has been completely unacceptable. Up to a thousand people have congregated in the area on recent weekends, without due regard for Covid-19 restrictions,” it said.“The associated antisocial behaviour is having a hugely detrimental effect on both the local community and the environment,” it added, explaining it had consulted with the Garda, public representatives and local residents.The plaza was due to close early on Friday until Monday morning.However, Liam Ryan, owner of the Lower Deck pub, which faces onto the square, said the measure threatened local businesses who benefit from people using the space.Takeaway pintsHe said pub staff have served takeaway pints from the door of the premises following requests from local residents to do so, adding that his relationship with people living in the area was very good.“We only serve for five evenings a week, for three or four hours, and if it’s too busy we just close up,” he said.“The problem would be very limited if there was enough portaloos put out, it’s as simple as that.”Local Labour councillor Kevin Donoghue said that while there were problems with ongoing antisocial behaviour, notably public urination, he did not support the closure and has suggested the creation of a space that could be closed at night.The council said it was illegal to drink alcohol in a public place under city council bylaws, adding there would be increased Garda enforcement in Portobello this week and that “anyone found consuming alcohol outdoors in a public space may be fined”.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the issues around Portobello were as much about antisocial behaviour and littering and people drinking on a public street, which is against the law. “The fundamental advice we’re giving people is meeting outdoors is much much safer than meeting indoors,” he said.Traffic arrangementsMeanwhile, new traffic arrangements to facilitate outdoor dining and provide additional space for pedestrians are being trialled in Dublin city centre this weekend.Under the arrangements, which are in place from 6am on Saturday until 11pm on Sunday, there will be one lane of traffic on Merrion Row serving traffic from Kildare Street.Traffic from St Stephen’s Green East will be erted via Hume Street and Ely Place, where the direction of the traffic will be reversed. Traffic from Merrion Square seeking to head into the Stephen’s Green area and car parks will be erted via Pembroke Street and Leeson Street. Redirected bus route information is available on the Dublin Bus website.The arrangements are being trialled to facilitate outdoor dining, the council said.“The decision to proceed with the trial was made following a recent public consultation that received almost 2,400 submissions, with 93 per cent of respondents in favour.”The council said if the trial is successful a design can then be finalised in the coming weeks which would allow for accessible footpath extensions on both sides of Merrion Row to facilitate outdoor dining this summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots new dup leader is on traditionalist paisleyite wing of party","story":"Edwin Poots has defeated his constituency colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, by 19 votes to 17, to succeed Arlene Foster as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Video: Twitter@edwinpootsmla Edwin Poots is a strong opponent of the Northern Ireland protocol. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireEdwin Poots was, quite literally, raised in the DUP.After his election as leader on Friday, he reminded reporters that his father had been one of the party’s founder members he joined the DUP as a teenager following the killing of the Ulster Unionist MP Robert Bradford in 1981.He is also steeped in its religious elements, and is on the traditionalist, Paisleyite wing of the party. He is opposed to the decriminalisation of abortion in the North and has courted controversy over his views on homosexuality and evolution – he is a creationist who believes the Earth was created about 4,000 years ago.As minister for health he tried to maintain a ban on gay men giving blood which had been lifted elsewhere in the UK, a ban later found by the high court to be “irrational”, and also opposed same-sex couples being allowed to adopt children.CoupGiven his family connections, it was unsurprising, then, that Poots has long harboured a desire to lead the party, and was one of those rumoured to be moving against Arlene Foster long before she was deposed in last month’s coup.In the video message announcing his candidacy on social media, the minister for agriculture said he was a “proud Northern Ireland man. I love this people and this place, and it faces many challenging times”.Certainly he comes with plenty of experience a DUP member throughout his political career, he has been an MLA for Lagan Valley since 1998 and held several ministerial portfolios, including culture, health and, currently, agriculture.He is also a strong opponent of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Irish Sea border, and tried to prevent the construction of infrastructure for carrying out physical post-Brexit checks at the North’s ports in his capacity as minister.His traditionalist credentials could play well among those who opposed the softer line taken by Foster, though the Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister has posited that his facilitation of the port checks could undermine this.Yet as his eventual acceptance of the legal requirement to facilitate the checks demonstrates, he is also a pragmatist as minister for health he reached a cross-Border agreement on children’s heart surgery which led to sick children from the North being treated in Dublin, and he has proven himself capable of working with Sinn Féin – something which will be required.He began his political career as a member of Lisburn city council.

File photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinNational Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) official Prof Philip Nolan has admitted that describing the Lidl antigen test as “snake oil” was “not my finest moment in pandemic communication”. Nphet’s head of modelling’s comments on Twitter last Saturday drew a sharp rebuke from Harvard epidemiologist and immunologist Prof Michael Mina on Sunday. “For an advisor to your government - you don’t appear to know what you are talking about” with regard to rapid tests, Prof Mina replied to Prof Nolan. “The comment adds nothing of benefit and further sows confusion. You should be ashamed of your demeanour here.”In response, Prof Nolan used Twitter to tell Prof Mina that he had “inferred a great deal about my knowledge and motivation from one tweet”. In a long Twitter thread, Prof Nolan said the criticism of his original tweet was “fair enough”, but he wished to provide a few points of clarification and response.He said his “snake oil” comment was not a general point about antigen tests, but about the “uncontrolled and unsupported sale of antigen tests by a supermarket chain, and their (one hopes tongue-in-cheek) response to advice from @CMOIreland not to use them, as a negative test might give false reassurance that you are free of infection.” At a Nphet briefing last week the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan warned that people might buy sausages, charcoal for the barbecue and a box of antigen tests, to which Lidl Ireland responded: “Weekend Super Savers! Pick up a pound of sausages, charcoal for the BBQ and antigen tests for €31.” Prof Nolan said Ireland had prompt PCR testing so “it is hard to see the value added by self-administered antigen testing”. He added that Nphet “fundamentally disagreed” with the literature cited by Prof Mina in favour of home antigen tests. “Fundamentally, we disagree on the recasting of a known limitation of antigen tests (poor sensitivity) as specificity for the infectious state,” he said.“The claim that antigen tests approach 100 per cennt sensitivity for those who are transmitting (and the infections they miss don’t matter because they don’t transmit) is contested and our interpretation of the evidence differs from yours.“We are concerned that antigen testing is likely to miss a significant number of infectious cases. This assessment of the evidence is not ‘confused’ or ‘simply wrong’, it is a valid and careful evaluation, and we are not alone in the conclusions we have drawn. “We do not have great difficulty in differentiating infectious from post-infectious cases with careful public health investigation, and the detection of the latter gives important information in tracking sources and networks of transmission. “The greater concern is the limitations of antigen tests in detecting the presymptomatic infectious state, and the uncertainty about their actual sensitivity, in the field, in detecting symptomatic infection.“We are using antigen tests where they add value. They have been used in the management of outbreaks to give early insight into the scale and pattern of the outbreak. They may have value in detecting (re-) emergent disease in high-risk and congregated settings. “We are looking at a variety of other settings and contexts where antigen testing will be useful, based on international evidence and the outcomes of pilot validation in our own context.” Prof Mina also stated comments by the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly criticising antigen tests made him feel “sorry for Ireland”. He added: “It’s about time that they invite someone who actually can explain to them why they are misinterpreting the Cochran review and all of the science behind rapid tests. We’ve written about it extensively. They are simply wrong on this.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the cork fishmonger who met the queen i think there was a sense we crossed a bridge","story":" Pat O’Connell meets Queen Elizabeth at his fish counter in the English Market in 2011: “There comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’.”Looking back on his moments with Queen Elizabeth in the English Market, Cork fishmonger Pat O’Connell says the reception she received marked Ireland’s growing maturity and its willingness to view Britain in a new light.“We are influenced by history and we won’t forget history but there comes a time when you have to say ‘It’s time to move on’. And at the end of the day, we have more in common with Britain than what separates us,” he says.The encounter between the two was perhaps the apogee of her visit a decade ago this week, where she broke into a smile of genuine warmth as O’Connell quipped about calling an ugly monkfish, “the mother-in-law fish”.Deteriorating linksBut that was then and this is now. O’Connell is an astute observer of politics and is in no doubt that Anglo-Irish relations have deteriorated since, spurred by Brexit and everything that has happened since.He puts the blame at British prime minister Boris Johnson’s door: “In many ways, I think Boris is a mini-Trump. He doesn’t speak the truth and he is more interested in himself than his country and he’s sold a pup in a lot of ways.“He said it wouldn’t hurt Britain to be out of Europe but I think it’s created huge difficulties for Britain. And there will be more to come because I think the devil is in the detail of that deal and we are only seeing the start of it.”However, he finds grounds for optimism in the British visitors that used to call to his stall in the English Market prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and will do so again once it lifts.“We’ve always had a lot of British people coming in but, after the queen’s visit, they were a bit more relaxed about it. Again, like ourselves, I think there was a sense with them we had crossed a bridge and that can only be a good thing.” How is Brexit affecting you?

In keeping with tradition he rarely intervened on political issues.An unlikely friendship with Michelle Obama no doubt helped his image. In 2016 he was pictured in a warm embrace with the first lady. Two years later Bush was caught on camera surreptitiously passing a cough sweet to Michelle Obama at John McCain’s funeral. She subsequently described Bush as a “wonderful” and “funny” man.The death of George HW Bush in 2018 also served to bolster the standing of the Bushes, as the country contrasted the reign of previous Republican presidents with the chaos of the Trump presidency. “He looked for the good in each person, and he usually found it,” George W said of his father at his funeral in Washington National Cathedral, as Donald Trump looked on dourly.PortraitsBush jnr’s rehabilitation has continued with the publication of a new book by the former president. Out of Many, One: portraits of America’s Immigrants is a collection of portraits of 43 immigrants who have made the United States home.Bush, an amateur artist, has painted each of the iniduals, their portraits accompanied by a short text telling their story. They range from well-known names like Madeleine Albright, the former Democratic secretary of state who was born in Czechoslovakia and Austrian-born former governor and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, to lesser known figures.These include Philip Alier Marchok, a Sudanese refugee who came to the US in 2001, and Paula Rendon, a Mexican immigrant who helped raise the Bush children in Texas. Also featured is Northern Ireland former golfer and current broadcaster David Feherty.The aim of the book, according to the former president, is to reveal “the humanity behind one of our most pressing policy issues and the countless ways in which America, through its tradition of welcoming newcomers, has been strengthened by those who have come here in search of a better life”.The notion that Bush would wade into such a contentious issue as immigration is not as subversive as it may seem. During his political career Bush successfully reached out to the Hiic community, correctly assuming that the Republican party needed to make inroads with Latino voters in the rapidly-ersifying state of Texas if it wanted to have a political future.In recent media appearances to promote his book, Bush has been asked to weigh in on the current state of the Republican party. In an interview with NBC’s Today show last month, he described the party in its current guise as “isolationist, protectionist and, to a certain extent, nativist” – his strongest criticism of his own party since leaving office.He urged Republicans to tone down the rhetoric on immigration, describing his position as “border enforcement with a compassionate touch”.Political dynastyThe former president is making his most strident political interventions as a member of another political dynasty close to the Bushes is coming under attack. This week saw the purging of Liz Cheney from her leadership role in Congress.As the daughter of Dick Cheney, who served as vice-president under Bush, she has been a passionate defender of her father’s foreign policy decisions and espouses the closest thing to a Bush doctrine in the current Republican party. That neo-conversion of Republicanism seems to be on the way out, as the party digs into its anti-interventionist, nativist Trump credentials.Nonetheless, while Bush is enjoying something of a renaissance as his party tears itself apart, it’s not all plain sailing. A new Slow Burn podcast is re-examining the events that led up to the ill-fated invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan under Bush.The 43rd US president’s new book may be topping the New York Times bestseller list, but his role in starting America’s endless wars will never truly be forgotten.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

Bolton’s infection rate has doubled in the past week and currently sits at 152 cases per 100,000 people – the second highest in the country after Erewash in Derbyshire, whose own spike has been linked to an outbreak in a secondary school.The Bolton cluster of infections is due to the Indian variant of concern which Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has said he is anxious about and which could lead to more local restrictions being enforced.The Rumworth area of the town, which has a large Muslim community and where 43.1 per cent of the population is classed as black and ethnic minority, is a particular hotspot and there are fears that Eid may further accelerate the rise. Umar says some people have been put off being vaccinated during Ramadan (when Muslims fast) over the past month because of concerns over any side-effects, while others remain hesitant. “Some people are scared of taking the vaccine,” he admits.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, police and local health officials have this week publicly cautioned against any mixing between households over Eid. On the eve of the festival Dr Niruban Ratnarajah, chairman of NHS Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group, said “we would urge people not to lose sight of what we are trying to achieve in Bolton.The current spike is being driven by young people – the rate of infections for 10 to 14-year-olds is 244 new cases per 100,000 people, while for 15 to 19-year-olds age it is 223 – both more than 10 times the national average.While around 90 per cent of those aged over 65 in the borough have had their first jab, among the younger generation locals feel the public health messages are not getting through – particularly around mask-wearing and social-distancing.“The youngsters around here aren’t taking it seriously,” says Pradip Patel, 29, who works at a local branch of Sainsbury’s.As well as refusing to stick to Covid guidelines, Mr Patel, whose family arrived in Lancashire from India, says local people travelling between the two countries before a ban was imposed last month will have accelerated the spread of the new variant.Bolton has also proven itself something of a hotbed of Covid denial during the pandemic. Last September Yasmin Qureshi, Labour MP for Bolton South East, warned that some people in the area believed the virus was a fake, government-constructed concept and as a result were refusing to adhere to social-distancing guidelines.The idea of Covid being a hoax is voiced by several young people I encounter who insist they have no intention of being vaccinated.Alongside surge testing this week to determine the extent of the spread of the Indian variant, a bus has been parked in the grounds of the Essa Academy vaccinating residents with the Pfizer jab on a first-come-first served basis. Staff on site say they have been vaccinating 2-300 people a day.Mr Burnham and others have called in recent days for all over-16s to be given the jab to ease the surge in cases. A local NHS spokesperson insisted the criteria for those at the vaccine bus remains only for people aged 38 and above in line with national guidelines, however the  spoke with a number of younger people queuing up.Among them was Izhar Ulhaq, a 31-year-old sales assistant who had only recently returned to the UK from Pakistan before the country was added to the “red-list” last month.He said he had contracted Covid in Pakistan in January and fallen seriously ill before eventually recovering. “I am really happy to get my jab,” he said.The rising number of cases has yet to trickle down into hospitalisations and deaths.In fact, there has not been a single death reported from Covid-19 at the Royal Bolton Hospital in the past two weeks, where overall 648 people have died since the start of the pandemic.To break what has now become a depressingly familiar cycle, Bolton now knows it is in a race against time.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis israel riots jews arabs hand netanyahu political lifeline","story":"It is Israel\u0027s greatest security crisis in years, a tragedy for Palestinian and Israeli civilians that has already claimed dozens of lives and threatens to destroy what is left of the Middle East peace process. But for one man at least, the crisis in Gaza and mixed Arab-Jewish cities inside Israel has an undeniable silver lining. At the start of this week, it looked like Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s number was finally up.After weeks of talks, opposition parties - including the Arab Ra\u0027am - were about to muster a majority in the Knesset, finally overcoming the Likud leader’s political dominance and potentially ending his 12-year stint as prime minister.Then, tensions in east Jerusalem exploded, riots broke out in mixed Arab-Israeli towns, and Hamas fired its biggest rocket barrage from Gaza to date.Suddenly, a coalition between Arab and right-wing Jewish parties was politically impossible.On Thursday, Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina party and the probable prime minister of the “government of change,” bailed out of coalition talks. According to Israeli media reports, he is now speaking to Mr Netanyahu about entering a Likud-led government instead. Mansour Abbas, the leader of the Arab Ra’am party, confirmed talks would be frozen until the Jewish-Arab violence tearing through mixed cities abated.Netanyahu was on the ropes at the beginning of this week. the opposition parties were poised to muster a majority,” said Anshel Pfeffer, the author of the biography Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.  Netanyahu\u0027s preoccupation with his own political and legal problems is part of the reason why he has not reined in Israeli police\u0027s heavy handedness in Jerusalem, and part of this rapid escalation of the crisis can be explained by that preoccupation.He is under a huge amount of criticism in Israel especially over the breakdown of law and order within Israel in mixed Jewish-Arab towns, he added. That said, there is a silver lining for him here.The “government of change” was a creative arrangement even by the standards of the Knesset, where no party holds an absolute majority and knotty coalition building is the norm.It would have seen Mr Bennett, a fire-breathing right-winger who over the years has been in and out of coalition with Mr Netanyahu, enter a power sharing agreement with Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party.But to make a majority, they also needed the backing of the Islamist Ra’am party - making the small Arab party an unusual kingmaker in Israeli politics.No one is saying Mr Netanyahu engineered the current crisis for his own benefit. And the crisis is far from an unalloyed boon.Many Israelis are furious with him over his perceived mishandling of the crisis so far.   Mr Lapid has said Mr Bennett is wrong to quit the talks and promised to continue trying to build an alternative government - although it is unclear how he can now do so. Mr Bennett, of course, has never made much secret of his own prime ministerial ambitions, and he could well come back to talks with Ra’am when he thinks his voters will wear it. And none of this makes Mr Netanyahu’s greatest headache go away.Despite periodic delays and postponements due to Covid, his trial on corruption charges that began one year ago continues. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"child tarpaulin aid workers price list exchange food shelter","story":"Charity aid workers have a price list of sex acts to exchange for food and shelter, experts have warned.Sexual abuse by humanitarian workers is “systemic” and discussed so openly that translators are even used to negotiate deals, a conference at King’s College heard on Friday.Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development select committee, said there is evidence of a “known exchange rate” for aid such as making a child “available” in return for tarpaulins for shelter or women having to exchange sex for employment.The Labour MP for Rotherham warned that a blind eye has been turned as it is assumed aid workers are “good people” who are “above reprimand” and the recipients of aid are “seen as people who ought to be grateful”.Ms Champion said: “If you are a woman in a humanitarian crisis desperate to get food for your children and the person standing there who is able to give you that food says ‘you can have the food, but this is what I want in exchange’, who wouldn\u0027t do that for their children? “How would you know that that wasn\u0027t the rate of negotiation to get that food for your children?“I\u0027ve heard across different humanitarian crises that there’s almost a known exchange rate. If you want the aid, if you want a tarpaulin, then your child needs to be made available, if you want a job then you are expected to sleep with the person who’s able to give you that job.”The MP said she had heard evidence from the Democratic Republic of Congo that “it was so normal that women were expected to have sex for jobs” that translators were “negotiating the deal” between them and UN officials.She said charities needed to follow the example of the Catholic Church in facing up to and addressing years of abuse within their organisations.The Sexual Exploitation of Women and Children by Aid Workers conference was told the abuse had been known about for more than two decades.But despite focus on the sector in the wake of the Oxfam sexual abuse scandal,  new research by King’s College has found that under-reporting and “cover-up by officials” have contributed to the fact that its true extent is not known.Jessica Toale, who carried out the literature review, found data from the UN since 2017 “shows that allegations against UN staff, related personnel and implementing partners is consistently higher than those against the military and police contingents of peacekeeping missions”.Research from Liberia estimated that, at the height of the humanitarian crisis, around 58,000 women had engaged in transactional sex with UN workers, she said.Around 60 per cent of the perpetrators have been identified as local staff or contractors, the study found.Ms Toale said: “Sexual exploitation is more prevalent than sexual abuse, and this most often takes the form of exchanging food for sex for food and basic items including sanitary pads, tarpaulins for shelter or employment  opportunities.”But she warned that there was no consistency to the data or obligation on NGOs to publish reports of abuse.Asmita Naik, a former UN worker turned consultant, said the “reason we know so little” is that “there is a vested interest in not looking into this amongst the very type of groups that would normally be profiling human rights issues”.Her concern that there was a “moral assumption” that peacekeepers are “doing good” was backed by Ms Champion, who said there was not enough safeguarding as it is assumed that those on the ground are “doing it for all the right reasons”.Ms Champion called on the Government to do more to ensure transparency and protect whistleblowers because many of the NGOs are funded with taxpayers’ money and “we have an absolute duty to make sure that it is spent in the most appropriate way”.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has already made any transactional sex by itsworkers a gross misconduct issue, but is under pressure to ensure the same rules apply to all organisations that receive Government money.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"learning live variants humanitys next big test","story":"The Indian variant is the real deal. There is still much to be learnt. But a concerning picture is emerging from laboratory studies and real-world observations about reduced vaccine effectiveness, higher transmissibility and potentially even more severe disease.A laboratory study from University of Cambridge scientists, led by Professor Ravi Gupta, concluded that the Indian variant (B.1.617) has “modestly reduced” susceptibility to antibodies generated after vaccination. But, most importantly, the vaccine still appears largely to protect from severe illness and death even if people can get moderate disease. A German and two Indian lab studies have reached the same conclusion.The ability for the variant to infect vaccinated iniduals has also been confirmed by cases in vaccinated healthcare professionals in India, as well as in Singapore, where five of seven infected iniduals in the Changi Airport cluster were fully vaccinated.While most of these cases have been mild, the Indian Medical Association claims that nine of 194 doctors who have died during the current outbreak were fully vaccinated. This claim remains unverified. As the vaccines were never thought to be one hundred percent effective, this could relate to the sheer number of cases in India. Overall, severe cases among fully vaccinated people is extremely rare.There is also evidence that the specific “variant of concern” (B.1.617.2) is transmitting faster than the Kent variant. It has spread to more than forty countries and will most likely become the dominant global strain. India has had millions of new cases, and tens of thousands of deaths, over recent weeks.Sage modelling indicates it is 30 per cent more transmissible. Public Health England have found 1,313 cases as of yesterday, more than doubling in a week from 520. Most of these cases are in London and the north west. More broadly, the UK has experienced a 12 per cent increase in cases over the last seven days. If the Indian variant grows unencumbered at the current pace there could be millions of cases in the UK within three months.It is also possible the new variant causes more severe disease – though this finding is the most speculative. A hamster study found that the Indian variant causes more inflammation compared to other variants. This finding is yet to be replicated in humans, although case reports from Indian hospitals paint a worrying picture. Put together, the variant complicates hopes that the pandemic will shortly be over. The virus will be with us for many years to come thanks to continued variants and large unvaccinated populations across the world.The Indian variant presents a good learning opportunity for how we respond to mutations over the coming years. We should be careful not to panic. Now that we have effective vaccines and the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system is small. The Government must resist the urge to pull the lockdown trigger. The alternative is living the rest of our lives under house arrest for months every year.But nor should we be complacent. The Government is right to bring forward second vaccinations for vulnerable people and surge vaccinations for all ages, including school children, in areas with new clusters. This should go some way to reducing the spread and reduce the risk of death. Young people in particular have strong immune responses within a week to the vaccine. There is also a need to maintain strong border controls from countries with high case numbers to avoid the threat of importing new variants.Overall, the best approach is to ‘Go South Korea’: extensive surveillance and genomic sequencing combined with rigorous testing, tracing and isolating. Preparing regular vaccine boosters and variant updates will be needed, as well as developing the next generation of vaccines that are less susceptible to weakening from mutations.This can follow our approach to the flu. The World Health Organisation advises on regular vaccine updates based on surveillance of the most prominent strains. Manufacturers then update jabs using a previously approved methodology that is known to be safe and effective from earlier trials. The vaccine is bought straight to market after quality testing. This ensures we can have an annual jab, that saves thousands of lives, without a lengthy and unnecessary randomised controlled trial (RCT).This approach is not foolproof. Thousands of people still die each year from the flu. The same risk will continue from Covid-19. Not everyone develops a strong immune response after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. There will be a continued risk to life from the virus reaching iniduals with a poor immune system – be that because of age or medical condition. Humanity now faces long Covid. There is unlikely to be a moment of total triumph against the virus. Instead, we will have to reach a very British compromise: keep calm and muddle through.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off

imperial measurements","story":"Oxford University has suggested imperial measurements should be decolonised over links to the British Empire.The mile, inch, yard, pound and ounce are “tied deeply to the idea of the Empire” and their presence in the curriculum could change, decolonising plans by Oxford’s maths, physics and life sciences faculty suggest. Undergraduates have been recruited (on living wage) to conduct extensive research this summer, alongside scholars, into how Oxford’s science curricula can be made less “Eurocentric”. They will draw up proposals for lecturers to implement any recommendations in syllabuses, in a drive to “ersify” maths and science courses.The plans, seen by The , advocate a cultural shift in teaching so that Oxford students\u0027 learning is broadened so they understand the “global historical and social context to scientific research”, and assess “historical work revising older narratives of scientific progress”.It acts on a pledge by Oxford’s vice-chancellor to embed teaching on colonialism into courses following last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, and is among a raft of decolonising overhauls currently underway on campuses across Britain.It comes despite Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, in February warning the “so-called decolonisation of the curriculum” mirrored the Soviet Union and was “censoring history”.The Government also announced in this week\u0027s Queen\u0027s Speech that universities will face fines for silencing students and academics, under new free speech legislation to combat “rising intolerance” on campus.One new curriculum addition to be considered in Oxford’s eight-week decolonising project, is “history of modern measurement, which is tied deeply to the idea of the ‘Empire’ and Imperial standardisation”.Another, for maths courses, is “ancient Chinese number theory – particularly the Chinese Remainder Theorem”.In biology, “economic plant collecting in colonial Brazil (1500-1800)” could be investigated for addition to the curriculum this autumn.Imperial units of length, weight and volume could be given historical context in Oxford\u0027s physics curriculum, which currently includes modules on classical mechanics, condensed matter and fluids.The system of units were officially introduced in the 1824 British Weights and Measures Act, and by 1826 were widely adopted across the British Empire and Commonwealth.However, Imperial units have a longer history, born out of the so-called English Units, a combination of Anglo-Saxon and Roman systems of measurement which included variations of feet, inches and yards.Since the colonial period many countries shifted to metric units of measurement, such as metres and kilograms, but some African and South Asian nations still use limited forms of imperial units, including gallons for volume.Following pressure from students angered by George Floyd’s death in the US last summer, Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Prof Louise Richardson, committed to a “ersity fund” for teaching resources to shake up curriculums, saying it was “an area that is frequently overlooked”.Protests saw Oriel College launch an inquiry into a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes on its facade, and Prof Richardson vowed to ramp up decolonising efforts. “Many departments in social sciences have begun work on making their curriculum more inclusive and adding erse voices to it,” she said.“This includes steps such as integrating race and gender questions into topics, embedding teaching on colonialism and empire into courses, changing reading lists to ensure substantial representation of a erse range of voices, and ensuring better coverage of issues concerning the global South in syllabuses.”The campus “decolonising” drive, often focused on the humanities, is increasingly sweeping the sciences.Two faculties at Sheffield University have named Sir Isaac Newton, the founder of modern physics, and Charles Darwin as figures who may need historical context when their theories are taught because of apparent ties to the Empire.An Oxford spokesman said: “The university supports the ersifying STEM curriculum project, which is looking at how curricula might change to acknowledge questions of ersity and colonialism.We value the input of students into this work all recommendations arising from the project will be referred to departments to consider next steps. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The

Critics are now calling for sweeping changes to Britainaposs electoral system, amid fears voters are being ignored over and over again. Taking the results of just county, unitary and metropolitan councils which held full elections, the Tories took % of the overall vote, but this was enough to win % of the total number of seats up for grabs. In one area, Staffordshire, the party secured more than eight out ten seats, despite claiming % of votes.Across England, Wales and Scotland, Boris Johnson ’s party won , seats - and a clear majority of over % of the seats in  out of  councils.Meanwhile, Labour took a % share of the vote, and  seats - % of the total number of seats contested.The Lib Dems secured % of the votes and won  seats, while the Green Party won just  seats, despite winning a % vote share. Another % of voters cast their ballot for an independent candidate, or one of the fringe parties, such as Reform or UKIP. These candidates picked up a combined total of  seats - % of the total number up for election.  However, campaigners have long been making the case for Britain’s “First Past the Post”voting system to be scrapped, in favour of a proportional voting system . Under PR, the number of seats each party wins would match the share of votes received. That would still have meant a clear victory for the Conservative Party. But instead of holding , seats, the Tories would have won , -  fewer than the party picked up on election night.That would give the Tories a clear majority of % of the seats in six councils, rather than , and % of the seats on Worcestershire County Council, with one seat still currently vacant.  Under PR, Labour would have picked up an additional  seats, taking the party to a total of , and numbers of Lib Dem councillors would be swelled by , giving the party to  seats. But the Green Party has the most to gain. Under PR, the party would have won  seats - that adds up to  more Green councillors than were actually elected.However, many of the independent candidates who stood on a local  would not have secured enough votes to gain a seat. Evenall votes cast for independent and fringe party candidates were lumped together under one banner, they would have won  fewer seats. The Electoral Reform Society has relaunched a petition calling for England’s voting system to be changed. It says that under the current voting system, ballots not cast for the winning candidates in each ward go to waste. It believes PR would be a much fairer system and would allow more people’s voices to be heard. Dr Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the Electoral Reform Society, said: “Behind these figures are thousands of voters being ignored - often election after election. “These one-party-takes-all outcomes are a deadweight on our democracy, with voters feeling silenced or taken for granted. When a party can get near % representation on a fraction of the vote, something is clearly wrong. “People will look at these outcomes and think – how can this be fair  It isn’t, and it’s time for change. “The broken, winner-takes-all voting system used for England’s councils creates local one-party states that too often seem immune from challenge.  “Voters deserve fair, proportional representation, something that’s impossible under First Past the Post.” Proportional representation means any voting system where the number of seats a party secures matches its share of the vote. However, there are a number of dferent PR systems which can be used. While FPTP decided the outcome of all council votes across England, elections to the Welsh Senedd, Scottish Parliament and London Assembly all used a proportional voting system known as the Additional Member System . With this system, voters have two ballot papers. On the first, voters are asked to use a cross to mark the candidate they want to be their constituency representative. The second ballot is a list of political parties standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies.  However, Home Secretary Priti Patel has already unveiled plans to switch all future mayoral elections in England to a FPTP system. Ministers are pressing ahead with changes after Labour won  out of  mayoral posts contested across England. Meanwhile, the constituency vote retains the First Past the Post system to elect constituency MPs, but the regional vote uses proportional representation to elect additional, regional MPs. It’s aim is to provide a proportional parliament, but also keep a single local representative. However, the Electoral Reform Society sees the “Single Transferable Vote” system as the “gold standard”. Under this system - which is used for local elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland - each elector marks their ballot against their most preferred candidate, but then also marks back up choices. If their first preference is eliminated , their ballot is transferred to a back-up selection, rather than being discarded.The Electoral Reform Society petition, calling for changes to the voting system, can be found here.

But the Government needs to explain why India was put on the travel red list two weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were – despite being the source of the iant. We are now paying the price for the failure to protect our borders. It’s anti-social What will it take for social media companies to accept their social responsibility  The tech firms have failed to tackle racism, bullying and discrimination online. Now we learn they are allowing people with eating disorders to be bombarded with adverts for diet supplements and weight-loss apps.  The companies claim they remove the advertisements as soon as they are notied. This is the same poor excuse they use when it comes to abusive or racist content. What they refuse to admit is their algorithms are specically designed to maximise profits without regard for social consequences. Given their revenue, they could easily afford to do more to police their s to prevent people being exploited, trolled or abused. They refuse to do so because they care more about money than morals.

Chemo and radiotherapy can really damage your chances of becoming a natural birth parent. I remember, my younger brother Sean needing to go to St Mary’s in Manchester when he was just  to ‘supply’ some of his sperm. The fact that he didn’t drive yet and our mum and dad had to take him absolutely broke my heart in two. I hated that he was so bloody young and the fact that mum and dad knew what he was going to be doing in that room, it felt so utterly s***. Poor Sean. I’ve spoken with ladies who have been left infertile, or without a womb or oies to create a little human. It’s just so unfair - and the treatment is barbaric in some ways.  Before Ivy, I had miscarried with my first ever pregnancy at  weeks.  weeks probably sounds early to some people, but I had literally known from week  and was delirious with excitement. Trying to contain myself when it came to telling people and buying things and eyeing up new prams. But then one day at work, sitting at my desk I felt it My teeny tiny human was gone already. It’s awful to go through this and yet so many of us do without ever really talking about it. When we fell pregnant again months later, the joy I’d had the first time round was definitely still there, but it was tinged with a big dark cloud of fear, in case it happened again. Thankfully, Ivy was born perfectly healthy in spite of my cancer diagnosis just two weeks earlier. Because we had to move pretty quickly to have my mastectomy and bring Ivy’s birth on early, we weren’t given an option to freeze any of my eggs - plus we wouldn’t have qualied for financial help as we already now had a child.  To be honest, another baby wasn’t important to me in the slightest at that moment in time, all I wanted was to live so that I could love the baby I already had. Plus, my labour had been horric and I remember telling Michael “I’m glad I can’t have any more because I am never going through that again!!” Before long though, I had that yearning for another baby. I missed Ivy’s kicks in my tum and the peachy fuzz of a newborn babe. Trying again for another baby was scary but I’ll save that conversation for another day. Ultimately though, we decided we were too scared to get pregnant again as my breast cancer had been fuelled by my pregnancy hormones. I couldn’t bear to go through nine months of fear and then potentially my cancer ing so we decided to do something we had always talked about - adopt!  After a pretty long process, we were finally approved in November . In January  whilst waiting to be matched with a little boy, my cancer came back and this time, I was told it was no longer curable. Obviously, I refused to accept that and after a second opinion, more treatment, surgeries, diet changes etc, I somehow got to ‘no evidence of disease’ and although I still have an incurable diagnosis, we’re hoping that by staying on lelong chemo, the bugger won’t come back! So we were given the flippin’ go ahead to adopt!!! We were finally matched with a baby boy who was literally our light at the end of the most terrying tunnel. Something we had been told was no longer possible WAS possible - I still pinch myself now! Some of the things I’d really like to try and get across to anyone reading this is the language used around adopted adoptive families. I spoke with Adoption UK recently and some of the terminology used around adopted families is just not okay. Here’s a few we’ve encountered: At least you didn’t have to go through labour!Some women would do anything to experience a natural birth, myself included. It’s hard not to make light of it sometimes, i know. But instead, you could simply congratulate them as you would any other new parents.Send him back!This is unreal. Can you imagine year child hearing this and feeling a sense of not belonging or feeling as though he doesn’t belong. If you feel the need to say something about their behaviour, just go with whatever you would say to a child who isn’t adopted - easy!My sister’s a weirdo, I think she must be adopted!So many of us are guilty of using this phrase and it’s clearly not meant as an insult - but think about how an adopted child overhearing this might feel  “Am I a weirdo  Am I strange  Is that why I was put up for adoption ” There are so many scenarios they could have going on in their little heads, so just try to keep it at “my sister’s a weirdo.”His birth parents didn’t deserve him anywayWe have heard this so many times - it doesn’t make us mad, we just hate the idea of Bill feeling somehow ashamed of where he came from. When strangers are passing judgement on the people that brought him into the world, it can bring a sense of stigma with it. We never want him to feel like his birth parents were bad people - and that he’s ‘lucky’ to have us. We’re bloody lucky to have him!Can we see some photos of his birth parents.Nope! They’re very private to us. We know how easy it is to judge a book by its cover. People might try to see similarities in his birth parents or think they look a certain way and therefore - they judge! This is something we never want Bill to experience, so the photos are for our eyes only, thank you very much.There are so many reasons children are taken into care but what we learned in our training was that almost every single parent doesn’t want to give their child up.And that is heartbreaking, no matter what the circumstances are. For a parent to have a child taken from them is horric. We obviously have to look at the bigger picture and remind ourselves that it was in the best interests of the child. Just because a birth parent can’t look after a child, doesn’t always make them bad people. They could be too young, or have learning dficulties which prevent them from taking good care of their baby. They could be a product of their environment addicted to drugs or alcohol, violent, homeless. So please try not to wonder too much about the background of our children, because all you need to know is, he’s our child and we love each other.

Doctors warned Jes Dean, , that she could have been left blindshe hadnapost sought medical attention after reacting to a home kit. She said she was left with aposcrusty caterpillarsapos and a swollen face oozing liquid after skipping the test. The mum is now encouraging others to always follow the order to carry out one so they are not at risk. Jes, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: Four days after I did my eyebrows I woke up and all my head, eyelids and eyebrows were swollen - I felt absolutely awful.  The following day my eyebrows were weeping a lot, it felt tight on my head and I felt really, really run down. It was horrendous looking at myself in the mirror. It just didnapost look like me, it was like my face was deformed. My eyebrows are matted around the scabs and theyaposre sticking out in dferent directions. The crusty matted caterpillar look wasnapost one I was going for. I can feel the scabs want to come off but theyaposre pulling all my eyebrow hairs out with it. Iaposm trying my hardest not to touch it and Iaposm using pure aloe jelly on it. I think Iaposm going to be left with hardly any eyebrows at all after this.  The beautician said she thought would be fine to use a tiny amount of Eylure Dybrow permanent tint for brows without a test. Jes, who is mum to Jaiden Dean, , Marlee Dean, nine, and three-year-old Logan Dean, said: Iaposm really allergic to hair dye. When I was younger my friend dyed my hair and my face swelled up and it burnt all my scalp, it was horric so Iaposve always kind of stayed away. But then I just thought aposoh itaposs only a little tiny bit of tintapos I didnapost even leave it on for the recommended amount of time it was literally two minutes. I cleaned the area and then put on literally the tiniest little bit onto my eyebrows and two minutes later I wiped it off and that was it. It came up in little tiny bumps and was a tiny little bit itchy but nothing major.  For some reason, I just thought Iaposd be fine but I wasnapost, it was completely irresponsible and stupid. Days later, thataposs when it got really, really bad. After using the tint on April , Jes said she woke up with a grossly swollen face on May - leaving her requiring urgent medical help. After speaking to , she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance over concern that her symptoms were worsening. There she was assessed and prescribed steroids, antibiotics and antihistamines and sent home to heal. Now she has watched in horror as her matted eyebrows clump together with the aposthick and crustyapos scabs and drop off - leaving her concerned they may not grow back.  Eylure said they always state on their packaging that a patch test must be carried out - hours prior to any form of dye application, evenaposyou are a regular user and have previously patch testedapos.Describing the ordeal, Jes said: I didnapost get out of bed for three days, I slept on and off in the dark away from any bright lights or noise.I just felt awful, I was drained of energy and I couldnapost really open my eyes and concentrate on anything.On Wednesday I rang the doctors as I wasnapost getting any better. My eyebrows started feeling hot and tight, they were weeping a lot and I just felt really, really run down.I had no energy and I felt really weird, not myself. My heart rate and temperature was raised and the worry was that any infection might leak into my eyes.They were weeping yellow and white liquid and I had thick scabs. It was crusty all around my eyebrows, it was awful.The surgery referred me to  and they said because it didnapost happen straight away and it was getting worse after such a long time that they needed to send an ambulance out that took me to AE.There they gave me antibiotics, steroids and antihistamines and after a few hours I went home.Now slowly on the path to recovery, Jes is extremely self-conscious of how she looks and fears her eyebrows may fall out and never grow back.Jes said: I feel awful looking in the mirror seeing myself like this. I went out for lunch with the kids and two little children came up to me and said aposwhataposs wrong with your eyebrows apos I told them I burnt them, I was so self-conscious.When I went to AE I ended up putting my face mask over my eyebrows because I didnapost want people to look at me, itaposs just embarrassing and I should know better.The beautician is now urging everyone to always patch test before doing DIY eyebrow tints.Jes said: I wanted to share what happened to make people aware so they donapost go through what I have, itaposs definitely not worth it.Since sharing this Iaposve had so many people saying aposoh now I realise the importance of doing patch testsapos.Iaposm qualied, itaposs what I do, I knew Iaposd have a reaction but I just did not expect this at all, especially as it was only on for two minutes.Donapost even take the risk of not doing a patch test as you could end up with no eyebrows.You can actually die from this, a serious allergic reaction is not something to be messed around with.At AE they said I could have gone blind because it was so close to my eye, itaposs just not worth it.An Eylure spokesman said: We always advise that a patch test must be carried out - hours prior to any form of dye application as stated on our packaging, evenyou are a regular user and have previously patch tested.

Hellen Hetherington was walking down a stone stairway hand-in-hand with her new husband when he suddenly lost his footing. She fell too and ended up at the bottom of the steps. Hellen had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulance and missed her own wedding night. Her lawyers claim she suffered the injury because the exterior staircase was not lit. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  However, the owner of the stately home denies liability and the events company involved says the fall was a “pure accident”. Details of the case have emerged after papers were filed at the High Court. In the claim lawyer Wanda Szcygiel, acting for Hellen, wrote: “She waited for her husband before continuing to walk towards the marquee at the same time as her husband. “First the claimant’s husband, then the claimant fell almost at the same time. The claimant fell to the left. The claimant’s husband fell to the right. “The steps were inadequately lit and could not be seen, causing the claimant to fall as she could not make out the beginning of the stairs.”  Hellen’s accident happened in June  during her wedding reception at -year-old Sennowe Park - a historic country pile in Norfolk. The huge Edwardian country house was built in  by Thomas Albert Cook, who was the grandson of travel agency pioneer Thomas Cook. After enjoying her wedding and reception in the grounds of the stately home she and her husband retired to the bridal suite before midnight. They were on the way back to the marquee when she fell while descending stone steps connecting two terraces. Hellen, who works as head of procurement at a farmers’ buying group, initially needed round-the-clock care when she was recovering.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  She claims she is still suffering ongoing effects from the injury, which has impacted her ability to drive. In the court claim she blames both Sennowe Park and booking agent Softley Events for what happened. However, estate owner Charles Temple-Richards and the events company deny being at fault. In its defence to the action, Softley Events’ barrister Jamie Clarke argued an account given by Hellen’s husband proved the fall was an accident. Mr Clarke said: “The claimant’s husband explained in a calm manner that he had been holding the claimant’s hand whilst they were walking down the steps when he suddenly lost his footing and fell forward, adding that it was fortunate that he was very fit and in good shape as he had been able to roll and avoid a serious injury. “However, when he missed his footing, the claimant’s husband pulled the claimant down with him and she fell to the bottom of the steps. “Neither the claimant’s husband nor anybody  at the time made any reference to or criticism of illumination of the steps or of any other aspect of the condition of the steps as being a factor or factors in the alleged events. “The claimant’s husband’s account at the time describes a pure accident that was not attributable to any external factor.” Barrister Thomas Banks, for Mr Temple-Richards, said the steps were over  years old and were a “period feature” of the house. He said: “The claimant was aware of the steps, having been up and down them several times, and they were clearly visible as the claimant approached them. “It is specically denied that the steps were unlit. Suitable lighting was in place.” The case reached court earlier this month ahead of a full trial of the claim at a later date.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMarriageWeddingsStately homesWedding dayAccidentsCourt case"},{"url":null,"title":"couples sick anxiety after upmarket","story":"NewsCouples sick with anxiety after upmarket wedding venues ghost them post-lockdownEXCLUSIVE: Couples who had planned to tie the knot at Northop Hall Country House Hotel in Flintshire, Wales and Durker Roods hotel in Huddersfield claim they dont knowtheir big days will go aheadmirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY NewsHayley Clarke and Declan Armitage want to cancel their wedding following the treatment \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Happy couples have told The Mirror theyaposve been left fearing their long-awaited big days wonapost go ahead at venues that are part of luxury hotel chain bigdaywedding. Anxious customers claim theyaposve bombarded the company with emails, calls and texts trying to confirm their weddings are still on, only to be stone walled. Bigdaywedding - the public facing part of the hotel chain - has told The Mirror all weddings will go ahead as planned from June, but many nearly-weds are sceptical. Staff members were let go after the first lockdown, one former worker reported on Glassdoor, raising questions about how the operation will start up again by next month. Fed up with her calls being ignored, one bride-to-be claimed she visited one of the hotels and discovered an upstairs ceiling had collapsed when she looked into the seemingly empty building.Has lockdown spoilt your wedding plans  Email webnews@mirror Irate couples have now hired lawyers and started looking into the business. The warning signs have left people such as Carrie Hornby convinced sheaposll be out of pocket and left waiting even longer for her wedding. The -year-old, who says she has paid £, so far and planned to get married at Durker Roods hotel in Huddersfield, had to move her wedding to July  due to the lockdown. She claims she contacted the company in April to ask a question, only to be blocked first on her personal WhatsApp and then her work number the following day. Carrie says then spent days writing multiple letters, making phone calls and sending emails trying to speak to an employee, before deciding to cut her losses and cancel the wedding. When she finally got through to someone she claims she was told the money she had paid was non-refundable. The impact has been quite devastating, Carrie told The Mirror of the uncertainty surrounding her wedding. We didnapost sleep for days. I was so upset. I really have not handled this very well. Weaposre not rich people. We need that money. We canapost afford to lose £,. While Carrie has been told the wedding can go ahead, she says she does not trust the company due to what she sees as a lack of communication, care and honesty. We feel really betrayed. Itaposs a horrible feeling, to be ghosted and ignored is awful, she added.  Hayley Clarke now also wants to cancel her wedding which was to be at Northop Hall Country House Hotel in Flintshire, Wales. She claims she kept trying to phone the company only for her calls to go dead after she was blocked by her wedding planner. I have changed to another venue because I have lost all faith, Hayley, whose great-aunt died after the original wedding date was pushed back, said. We have had to dip into our savings because I do not want to delay my wedding again. Along with partner Declan, , the -year-old says she is now thousands of pounds out of pocket. Alarm bells started ringing for another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, when she had to move her wedding from May to August and did not receive an updated contract from bigdaywedding, she claimed. Similarly frozen out by the company, the -year-old says she visited Northop Hall and found a sign on the door announcing the property management had changed hands. The phone lines are not ringing through to the wedding planner and the hotel, the emails are bouncing back and I have also tried to contact the apparent new wedding planner, she said. Currently I have had no contact with the venue or wedding planner or the owners. I feel like both hotels have sold us a dream and the reality is far from it.  The physicianaposs associate, who says she has not had an updated contract confirming the rescheduled date, added: I even took a trip to Northop Hall to seeI could speak to anybody there and literally the lights were on in the hotel but nobody was home. When I went to Northop after I found out about the change in ownershipthe grounds are maintained, but in the front upstairs room you can see the ceiling has collapsed.Just shy of a hundred people have joined a Facebook page to share similar complaints about the bigdayweddingThey have banded together to hire a lawyer and call on the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate. A spokesperson for bigdaywedding said: The hotels are reopening in June and everyone will get their wedding as planned and those who’sdates could not be honoured due to Covid restrictions will or have been offered alternative dates. Our wedding planner has quit so I have now stepped in and I am in the process of contacting all the brides and grooms to put their minds at rest.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMarriageWeddings"},{"url":null,"title":"diana statue event must bring","story":"NewsDiana statue event must bring William and Harry together or nothing will, expert saysPrince Harrysfor his mum Princess Dianas memorial in the summer is said to be in serious doubt - but an expert says its the one thing that could see the brothers come togethermirrorShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsUnveiling Dianas statue is the only thing that can bring Harry and William together, a royal author has claimed \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The two brothers are said to have come up with the idea of a statue to commemorate their mum three years ago, before the rt that now seems to keeping the family apart. The statue would be unveiled during a memorial in the summer to commemorate Princess Diana on what wouldaposve been her th birthday on July . But doubts were raised over whether Harry wouldfrom his home in the US for the memorial as the two brothers have grown increasingly distant since the Sussexes explosively announced they would be quitting their lives as senior royals last year.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Things then got worse when Harry and Meghan gave their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey from their Calornia home in March. But according to royal author Duncan Larcombe, the statue is the only real thing that could bring the two once-close brothers together.He told The Sun : “The plan for the Diana statue, William and Harry hatched up in happier times. I think it goes back three plus years. “If that statue unveiling doesn’t bring them together, nothing will. “When the boys were sitting down hatching that plan, it would be utterly unthinkable to both of them that they’d have a falling out and it would make things awkward. While it was reported that Harry organised a summit for clear-the-air talks following Prince Philipaposs funeral, others claim they never went ahead as he is understood to have flown back to the US just two days later.  That while members of the royal family wanted to make sure their focus was on supporting the Queen at such a devastating time. The funeral for the Duke of Edinburgh on April  was the first time the brothers saw each other again since the bombshell interview, which was watched by  million people since first being aired in March. During the chat, Harry and Meghan sat from their home £.m home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, as they accused the royal family of racism and of being insensitive to mental health issues.They said a senior member of the royal family - which was later confirmed to be neither the Queen or Prince Philip - had raised concerns over their son Archieaposs skin tone.Meghan,  and who is expecting the coupleaposs second child, also claimed The Firm had failed to give her the support she needed when she sent suicidal while pregnant with her son, now two.

Former DSI John Bennett, of Gloucestershire police, was the man given the daunting task of piecing together Fred and Rose West’s decades of evil as the bodies began to pile up at  Cromwell Street in . But in his  memoir on the dreadful case, now retired detective Bennett revealed Mary was in their thoughts from the moment Fred first appeared in court as he had covered her disappearance as a junior cop himself decades earlier. Mary, , vanished on January , , while waiting for a bus in Gloucester and no trace of her was ever found. This week detectives have been scouring a cafe she used to work in hope of finding her body after a new tip-off. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Little did young frogman Bennett, who searched for her in the freezing waterways of Gloucester realise, but he would come face to face with her suspected killer Fred West years later. And it is a theory he did not discount during the investigation – the problem was evidence. Co-authored by BBC journalist Graham Gardner his memoir gives a blow-by-blow account of the investigation from Bennett’s perspective. In it he painted a picture of Mary as an innocent girl snatched cruelly from le.  “It soon became apparent that this pretty girl, who measured around ft in, was slim with blond, shoulderhair and came from a well-respected local family, was just a normal teenager of the time. “She had the occasional under-age drink with friends of her age and often went to the local Pop In cafe ...but otherwise she did what her parents asked her. “She was thrty and spent her pocket money on make-up and stockings. There was no reason for her to go missing that night and every reason for not to.” At the time DCI Bennett had little doubt Fred was involved but Fred refused to admit to it so the team set about trying to force his hand.  The book explains: “Bennett was in no doubt that Mary Bastholm was not one of the nine found at Cromwell Street but her disappearance was similar to that of Lucy Partington and possibly some other victims. “Yet the investigation had revealed that Fred West had worked in Bristol Road where she disappeared and the Pop in and the cafe may have been a regular haunt for both of them. “Certainly the media had latched on to this and made it the basis for speculation connecting West with the cafe, her disappearance and the victims. “Bennett accepted they might well be right for the theory had been discussed in briefings, but there was no evidence yet and they already had enough on their plate.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  “Her disappearance had to be looked at, but only to make sure they hadn’t missed any glaring connections.” The book reveals the investigation team finally decided to take West to the road where Mary disappeared and challenged him on it. “He was taken to a nearby allotment he had used, a ploy to seeit jogged his memory about other possible victims. “Then he was driven along Bristol Road where Mary Bastholm was last seen, her disappearance was raised but he denied all knowledge of her and remained indferent.  “There was no flicker of recognition, no outward sign he might be lying.” While DCI Bennett and his team knew they were under pressure to excavate the cafe back then there simply wasn’t the evidence to justy it. It remained unsearched until this week thanks to ‘new evidence’ from a documentary film crew. At the time West’s son Stephen claimed his dad confessed to him he had killed Mary but a weary Bennett concluded he could not trust fantasist West dismissing him at that point in the probe as a “chameleon.”  Gloucestershire Police said forensic assessment work would continue until Monday, before a more “considered decision” was made as to the extent of excavation. Police also defended the decision in  not to excavate the cafe, as there was “insufficient evidence” the teenager was buried there. West was charged with  murders, but took his own le in a Birmingham prison before his trial. Rose West was convicted of  murders in November  and is serving le.The Cromwell Street Murders: The Detective’s Story is available online and published by The History Press.

First time buyers Jackson Higginbottom and his partner, Holly, have finally had an offer accepted after battling to get a foot on the housing ladder for years.They had been gazumped several times, but finally struck a deal in a location that would traditionally have been way out of their price range, Cornwall Live reports.They later discovered that the seller of the house in Sennen, Cornwall, had rejected two huge offers - because he wanted to keep the house affordable for local people in the area, who are typically on lower wages.  Jackson said: As soon as you see somewhere you like… it’s gone. When you’re talking houses out of our price range, then fair enough. But when it’s first-time buyer prices, and they’re going like that, you can’t help but think, ‘for God’s sake’. It’s obviously locals after that, can’t people give us a bit of a chance  Jackson, a surfer, said when he saw the house in surf-mecca Sennen he instantly rushed to the bank to put in an offer - for the exact asking price. But he never expected it to be accepted, so was shocked to receive a call saying that the house was his. He continued: There’s us thinking we’re really stretching to offer that asking price. We don’t even know the guy, but he has done the bloody decent thing and turned away these offers. For us, we’d paid a higher deposit and took a while to get everything sorted as first-time buyers. He had seven months to hold off from tourists and wealthy cash buyers. Jackson said he was was incredibly grateful, but “amazed” to see just how hard it is to secure a home as a first time buyer in Cornwall. He added: It shouldn’t even be a story - ‘couple grows up and buys a house when they’re  in their local area’. But clearly it is. It feels like you’re being kicked out of where you grew up, to sum it up. We’re both surfers, we both want our kids to grow up here too. We’re outdoors people, we don’t want to go to the city and live that le. To have our upbringing and then find that we can’t afford to live here is horrible. Most of us never have any chance of living here.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFirst-time buyersproperty news"},{"url":null,"title":"indian covid variant areas highest","story":"NewsIndian Covid iant: Areas with highest number of cases - how many are in your region New figures show cases of the Indian coronavirus iant are soaring, with the highest totals in London and the North West of England as the country prepares to ease its lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-headlines--warning-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:UOsznw,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Have you tested positive for the Indian coronavirus iant  Email your story to webnews@mirror.  Given the rapid spread in some areas, the Government is facing calls to consider postponing the planned easing of most Covid restrictions in England in June.Local lockdowns  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out local lockdowns being necessary to contain the spread of the virus, admitting the Government was “anxious” about the iant. Surge testing has been launched in  areas, including Bolton, Formby and parts of London, while increased genomic sequencing and enhanced contact tracing are among other measures being used to prevent the spread of the iant, the Government said. The Government is also considering bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection.  Data from PHE shows a rise in cases of the Indian iant from  to , this week in the UK, with the agency saying cases were “rising in the community” and it was assessing the impact and severity of the iant. Three types of the B.. iant, first detected in India, are circulating within the UK, and it is B... that is spreading fast and causing concern. London and the North West have reported the highest number of cases of that strain, which the World Health Organisation has classied as a iant of global concern. In London, the proportion of confirmed and probable cases caused by the B... iant has surged to just under  per cent, while it is . per cent in the North West.  About a quarter of the  total cases in London were people who had travelled. In the North West, where there is widespread community transmission, the proportion of travellers among the  cases was much lower . The number of cases linked to people who had travelled to the UK from India soared in April, figures show. How many cases in your region  Here is a regional breakdown of the PHE data :London - North West - East - East Midlands - South East - West Midlands - South West - Yorkshire and Humber - North East -  In Bolton, which has one of the highest case rates of the iant in the country, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR Covid testing has been offered to , residents.

A vaccine bus has been set up to increase uptake among those who are eligible and a rapid response team of  nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has been sent in Surge testing has been deployed in Sefton, Merseyside, after cases of the Indian iant were confirmed in the Formby area, with anyone over  who lives, works or studies in the area urged to take a PCR test. Measures have also been brought in where, including in parts of London. Variant aposmight be dominantapos in two regions In a tweet, Professor Christina Pagel, a mathematician and professor of operational research at University College London, said the iant might already be dominant in London and the North West, based on the PHE figures and using S gene detection as a proxy.  Professor Pagel, a member of Independent Sage, added: I thinkwe just know too little about B... except that itaposs spreading rapidly and the risks are quite high. Dr Robertson, a coronavirus modeller at Loughborough University, told the Mirror that experts cannot be certain where the iant is becoming dominant as it takes time for conclusive sequencing of samples. He added: B... cases appear to be rising in North West England and London and cases have been detected in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, and Sefton. Some of these cases can be traced back to travellers, but many appear to be due to transmission within the community.  On Thursday, Professor James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, warned the Indian iant should be viewed as a country-wide problem, telling BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.” A PHE report published late on Thursday suggests the transmissibility of the Indian iant is similar to the Kent iant and may be slightly higher. Cases of the Indian iant are also growing at a faster rate than for the Kent iant. It is too soon to predict whether the Indian iant could overtake the Kent strain and become the dominant iant across the whole of the nation. Dr Robertson said: We saw that the Kent iant - B... - became dominant in the new year, and we are seeing signs that some areas are now having cases dominated by B....  It’s finely balanced. The so-called secondary attack rate is very similar between B...and B... . Basically, we need more time and more data to be more certain. But the high numbers of cases and the high levels of transmissibility mean that it is certainly possible for B... to become dominant – although there may be other iants that emerge that also compete. Dr Robertson said PHE is doing an excellent job collecting and analysing data, and surge testing is helping to gather better data. The Government on Friday said Boris Johnsonaposs June  lockdown road map easing – when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted – was still on track despite the latest figures. Dr Robertson said the Government must be cautious as any risk-taking could increase the likelihood of tougher lockdowns at a national or local level down the road.  He added: With all unlocking decisions, it is a balance of risk and reward – the rewards of being able to meet people indoors more easily but the risk of that causing increased transmission and case rates increasing. “We are in a dferent position to late last year. Much of the population is now vaccinated but by no means all. The virus will find the most vulnerable and will causes cases to be found. The question is how many of these cases go on to be hospitalised and die. It is a real risk, and one that only the Government can take. But taking that risk does mean that the potential for reintroduction of more stringent lockdown measures, either at a local or a national level, increases. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the Government was “anxious” about the iant and “there is a range of things we could doas he refused to rule out the possibility of local lockdowns. Despite the spread of the Indian iant, Mr Johnson said there was “nothing that dissuades me” from easing England’s lockdown on Monday or the further steps towards normality on June . But he added “there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do themthat is the advice we get”. Nadhim Zahawi urged people in the  areas of England with spread of the Indian iant of concern to follow local health advice, get tested and isolatethey test positive. Askedthe June  road map easing – when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted – could be put on ice, Mr Zahawi told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that this Monday’s reopening of indoor meet-ups “is still on”. When pressed on whether the plans for June  could be paused, Mr Zahawi said on Friday: “The way we don’t have to do that is by everybody doing their bit, by taking the two tests a week, doing your PCR test in those areas, and to isolate, isolate, isolate. “We have got to break the cycle of infection, because one of those big tests was infection rates have to be suppressed, and the other big test is iants. “If those cause a problem, then the tests will fail. The four tests have to be met for June .” Mr Zahawi said the seven-day rolling average figures for infection show a . per cent rise, but hospital admissions are down by . per cent. “That is good news because it tells you that the vaccines are clearly working in terms of hospitalisation and severe infections… but the infection rate is what is concerning, which is why we have to surge test and then isolate,” he said. Figures compiled by PA show that  per cent of Englandaposs  local areas have seen an increase in coronavirus infection ratesin the seven days to May . Bolton in Greater Manchester has the highest rate, with  new cases in the seven days to May  – the equivalent of . cases per , people. This is up from . in the seven days to May .

That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing.

Yet the Kray twinsapos self-styled legend is also one of celebrity pals, sex scandals and a turbulent home le. A new Britbox documentary, Secrets of the Krays, has lted the lid on Reggie and Ronnieaposs rise to fame, charting the beginnings of their criminal empire through to their eventual arrest and imprisonment in .Speaking to The Mirror this week, their cousin also revealed the shocking tale of their upbringing, including their awful dad who abused their mum and threatened to maul her with acidshe ever left.It set the thugs on a path to violence that saw them clash with Londonaposs sadistic gang lords, before befriending serial killers as they faced a le behind bars. From claims of an incestuous relationship to Reggieaposs baffling friendship with EastEnders star Shane Ritchie, here we look back at the wild le of the notorious gangsters. aposCigarette punchapos and gut-wrenching murder Running their crime syndicate from Bethnal Green, the Kray twinsapos violent reputation helped them keep a tight grip on power. While Ronnie was regarded as the more apospsychoticapos brother, Reggie was no gentleman either - reportedly having a sure-fire way to break a jaw in one hit. Dubbed the aposcigarette punchapos, it would see him offer his victim a fag before striking as they opened their mouth, leaving them writhing in pain.  The Kray syndicateaposs toughest rivals were the Richardsons, who were considered the most sadistic mob in London, with a penchant for pulling teeth out using pliers, cutting off toes with bolt cutters and even nailing their victims to the floor. When Ronnie shot dead a member of the gang, George Cornell, at the Blind Beggar pub in March , it sparked a chain of events that would eventually lead to the twinsapos imprisonment. A year after Cornellaposs death, the pair killed Jack aposthe Hatapos McVitie, whose gruesome death went down in infamy.  McVitie was a minor member of the Kray gang who had failed to fulfil a £, contract paid to him in advance to kill a rival. As punishment, he was lured to a basement flat in Stoke Newington, on the pretence of a party. After he entered, Reggie pointed a handgun at his head and pulled the trigger twice, but the gun failed to discharge. Instead, Ronnie held McVitie in a bearhug and Reggie stabbed him to death with a carving kne – pulling out his liver, which later had to be flushed down the toilet. In March , the Krays were sentenced to le imprisonment over the two murders, with a non-parole period of  years - the longest sentences ever passed at the Old Bailey for murder. Cooking with Moors murderer in jail The brothers were kept apart in prison, with Reggie first sent to HMP Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight and Ronnie locked up at HMP Durham, where he spent spells in solitary confinement for fighting with guards. Here, Ronnie is said to have struck up a sick friendship with Ian Brady, the notorious Moors murderer who killed five children with Myra Hindley in the s. In a letter to a penpal, Brady wrote: “Ronnie Kray and I did the cooking at Durham A Level Security Wing, in the s after three riots there.”  The convictsapos bond appeared even more twisted after it emerged the Krays had also befriended Ann Downey, whose daughter Lesley Ann, , was abducted, raped, tortured and killed by Brady and Hindley. Discovering a stash of letters after Annaposs death, son Terry said: “They are not the kind of letters you would expect from criminals like the Krays. “Everyone knows how vicious the Krays could be. Maybe mum was trying to find out more about Brady in prison. Over the decades, the brothersapos time in jail proved nearly as eventful as their le on the outside. Reggie later claimed to have become a born-again Christian, while Ronnie got married in Broadmoor to a former topless kissogram girl. Brothersapos aposincestuousapos relationship Unusually for their era - and even more so in the criminal underworld - Ronnie was openly gay, while Reggie was rumoured to be bisexual. However, biographer John Pearson caused a stir when he revealed a shocking secret about their sex lives - claiming the pair had at one point engaged in an incestuous relationship. Speaking to The Sun, John said: “Homosexuality was nothing to be proud of in the East End.“But as they became more and more notorious, Ronnie became quite shameless about it. “According to Ron, in the early days they had sex with each other, because they were terried about people finding out.” While Ronnie came out to his family and had a number of boyfriends, Reggie repeatedly denied that he was bisexual.Yet Laurie OaposLeary, a childhood friend of the Krays, told theit was an open secret between the brothers.I would say that Reg fought the fact he could also be bisexual more than Ron, but I knew of his affection for quite a few young male teenagers with whom he kept company, said OaposLeary. Ron would goad Reg when he went out with women and tried to influence Reg with his own appetite for young men. aposAwfulapos dad threatened mum with acid The Kraysapos cruel streak is said to stem from their turbulent upbringing, which saw them clash with their abusive dad.Cousin Kim Peat told The Mirror that their father, known as Old Charlie, would regular beat their mum Violet and threaten her with acidshe ever left. “He was an awful man,” Kim said. “He was horrible to Violet – violent from day one. They married in  when she was  but had to edit her date of birth as she was expecting her eldest son, Charlie. “Old Charlie gave her black eyes, bloodied noses. That’s where the twins’ violent streak came from. He saidshe ever left him he’d throw acid in her face and no one would look at her again.” She added that the monster only stopped abusing Violet when Ronnie threatened his father. “Ronnie was  when Old Charlie punched Violet in the nose, she said. “He ran downstairs, punched his dad in the nose and said, ‘If you ever touch my mother again, I will effing kill you’. Old Charlie never beat her again.” Pals with the Mafia... and EastEndersapos Shane Richie The twinsapos celebrity status was cemented at the funeral of Reggie, who died from cancer in October . Among the wreaths from mourners were displays from famous admirers including The Who singer Roger Daltry and pop star Morrissey.  There was also a wreath believed to be from the American Mafia - next to a photo of Manhattan was the message: In deep respect, from your friends in New York. The thugs had a string of A-list stars in their contact book, many of whom were business associates as well as pals. In , Frank Sinatra was said to have hired  bodyguards from Krayleigh Enterprises, which was the Kraysapos protection company. Meanwhile, painter Lucian Freud reportedly racked up more than £, in gambling debts to the twins, even wriggling out of an exhibition opening in fear of them showing up and demanding their money.  Perhaps most bizarrely of all, though, was Reggieaposs apparent friendship with EastEnders actor Shane Richie.

She was only  when she disappeared from Gloucester city centre on January , . She was last seen at a bus stop and was believed to be going to her boyfriendaposs house for a game of monopoly when she disappeared. There has been no trace of her since.Retired news reporter Alan Watkins, , has now spoken out to claim he was never asked by police for a follow-up statement after telling them he was the last to see Mary on the day she disappeared, GloucestershireLive reports.He spoke as police began investigating the Clean Plate Cafe in Southgate Street since Friday, May , after being alerted by an ITV crew making a documentary on serial killer Fred West. The crew found “possible evidence” of human remains by using aposground-penetrating radarapos and snfer dogs and alerted the police. Mary worked at the cafe, then known as the Pop-In cafe, as a waitress and West was a regular customer. The former solicitor of West’s we, Rose West, has alleged that Mary was the couple’s first murdered victim together. There have also been claims that West lay a basement floor in the building of the cafe, but police denied this in .  Mr Watkins, then a young reporter who was in his early s, claims to have seen Mary while he was waiting at the bus shelter on the opposite side of the road at about .pm. The dad-of-two said: “I saw this girl on the other side of the road and she had a bag. It was reasonably well lit but very dark. It had just started to snow, not heavily but it was snowing. So you get the flurries of snow going across.” The man remarked that she looked like she had hurried to the bus stop. Mr Watkins went on to say a grey van pulled up beside her bus stop - although admitted that articial lighting could have changed his perception of the colour of the vehicle.  “Somebody spoke to the girl,” he said. “And I didn’t take too much notice, I was thinking about where my bus was. “Then I looked across and I saw the back of the van drive off and the girl wasn’t there. “And that I think was when she was picked up by her killer or killers.” Recalling the young girl he saw, the -year-old is positive she was the same Mary Bastholm in a photo circulated in appeals to find her. Mr Watkins thought nothing of it until the following morning, when his news team were handed an appeal by police to find her. He worked for a news agency called Hyett’s Agency, based in St Michael’s Square, the neighbouring street to Cromwell Street where West lived. His agency provided articles for ious publications, such as the Birmingham Post and The Mail. During the morning press conference with police, he recalls how the missing girl was discussed and then how they moved on to other topics. “We were so curious because there were so many people involved looking for her that early after she disappeared,” said Mr Watkins. “I held back after the conference was finished and spoke to Inspector Arthur Merrett who was in charge of the press conference that morning and told him what I had seen.”  He said the inspector responded “very interesting” but that was the end of it as “he didn’t seem to be wildly enthusiastic to know any more”. Mr Watkins said: “Now for whatever reason, I was never asked to make a statement. I was never questioned by CID [Crime Investigation Department]. It just died with that report I made to the police. “I thought it was strange at the time and I still think it’s strange -odd years later. I still find it frustrating.” A spokesman for Gloucestershire Constabulary said: Currently we are focusing our efforts into investigating the potential evidence found by a production company specically related to the disappearance of Mary Bastholm. After we have completed this work we will review whether any other activity or enquiries are needed. The statement went on: During the course of the investigation into Mary Bastholmaposs disappearance over  dferent lines of enquiry were pursued.Following a complete review of the missing person file during the West inquiry, over  people were interviewed.The force initially said in a statement that forensic teams will be carrying out a major crimes investigation at The Clean Plate for “number of weeks” while they search for human remains. The forensic team is using geophysical survey equipment in the cellar to carry out assessments and they have not yet made the decision to carry out an excavation. They will make a “more considered” decision regarding the extent of the operation on May .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnITVFred WestDocumentariesSerial killersCrimeTeenagers"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice A Met Police officer has been found guilty of assault over clobbering a Wetherspoons drinker over the head with his baton in an aposunprovokedapos attack. PC Jack Wood, , denied assaulting Jake Smith, , who suffered a gaping gash to his skull on January  last year in Romford, Essex. He and colleague PC Archie Payne, , were convicted over striking Mr Smithaposs friend Scott Rooney, , who was grabbed by the throat and thrown to the ground. Mr Rooney, a railway engineer, claimed he was the victim of an unprovoked attack after trying to take a picture of PC Wood and his officer number. CCTV footage of the incident was shown to the court in London today. Mr Smith suffered two wounds to his head, .cm and cm ineach, as well as cm of bruising to his chest wall, the court heard. Both officers denied the charges against them.  Defending PC Wood, Robert Morris argued Mr Smith and his friend were binge drinking for ten hours and then aposrugby tackledapos other punters outside the pub. He told District Judge Nina Tempia there was aposno case to answerapos and claimed the officer had only acted as legally permitted to stop the bust-up. Mr Morris said: By the time that PC Payne and PC Wood were running towards the group, Mr Smith was on his feet and was aggressively moving towards the group. Not on his back, unable to defend himself. His actions were plainly to rugby tackle an inidual who was at some distance.  Not content with that, Mr Smith throws himself against a woman who was not involved in either group and who seems to have wandered into the melee and she is then knocked to the floor. What is plain, is that any reasonable person entering that situation would have reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Smith has committed offences of assault and affray. Mr Morris said PC Wood did not run into the fracas with the baton in hand, telling the court instead he took a measured approach and acted proportionately. The counsel told the courtthe police officer had sat back and done nothing he would have been criticised, and denied that he had immediately gone in to strike Mr Smith with the baton. He continued: In my submission, Mr Wood entered the affray properly, used force that he was permitted to use and the struggling only stopped when the baton was used. Prosecutor Nicola Shannon told the trial at City of London Magistratesapos Court there had been an argument between Mr Rooney and another punter, prompting two security guards to ask them to leave. She said they stayed for one more drink but, upon leaving, realised the man they had clashed with was outside with a number of others. The group was between the pub and the bus stop that Mr Rooney, who lived locally, needed to get to.  So the pair asked PC Wood and PC Payne, who were outside the pub on patrol, to escort them to the bus stop past the group, the court heard. Ms Shannon continued: The officers declined to do so, telling the grouphe was their friend itaposs not their responsibility to help, and ed to their patrol duties. Mr Rooney was attacked by the group... but shortly after that PC Wood ran into the scene, came behind Mr Smith, raised his baton and inflicted between three to four strikes. The prosecutor said while Mr Smith had his back towards the officer PC Wood appears to go from right to left with the baton held above his head in an overarm motion brings it down towards Mr Smith.  PC Payne is seen on the footage making a aposkicking motionapos at Mr Smith while he was on the ground. While PC Payne and a colleague had their body-worn cameras activated, PC Wood did not activate his until later, said the prosecutor. After Mr Smith was treated in an ambulance the officers ed to arrest him for affray, but the charge was later discontinued, the court heard. PC Wood, based at Romford Police Station, was convicted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Mr Scott and one count of assault by beating against Mr Rooney.  He will next be sentenced on  June at Westminster Magistratesapos Court. PC Payne, formerly based at the same station, was convicted of one count of common assault against Mr Rooney. He was ordered to pay a total of £, in compensation and court costs. Judge Tempia told the court her judgment was PC Wood did not use reasonable force. PC Wood had smashed Mr Smith twice on the head - despite the officer claiming he aimed for the shoulder, the judge continued, adding: I find all the civilian witnesses credible. Itaposs very clear to me that Mr Rooney was acting reasonably and calmly when he was asking for PC Woodaposs number, he had his arms behind his back. I also find that Mr Rooney did not have Mr Payne in a headlock.The judge told PC Wood he didnapost have to punch Mr Rooney at all, and I do not believe he used lawful and reasonable force to assist Mr Payne.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore Onpolitan PoliceCCTVCCTV footageCourt caseWetherspoons"},{"url":null,"title":"palace sources slam harry meghan","story":"NewsPalace sources slam Harry and Meghan as nothing ever appears to be their faultPrince Harry told Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast that he wants to “break the cycle” of the “pain and suffering” of his upbringing with his own kidsmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News ReporterLaura Harding:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video royal-biographer-says-brainwashed-prince-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:TvjkeIGm,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

One source criticised the Sussexes, saying Harry giving an interview to actor Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast wouldnapost help matters amid a rt between the duke and his family, including his older brother Prince William.What did you think of Harryaposs interview on the Armchair Expert podcast  Join the conversation in the comments section below.The source told the Daily Mail: They appear to be making careers of talking about their previous ones.It is not helpful. Palace insiders also noted nothing ever appears to be their own fault, the report added. Royal biographer Angela Levin accused Harry of being incredibly rude and said the interview was ruthlessly cruel towards the Queen, who is grieving following the death of her husband. Ms Levin told Good Morning Britain: He is being incredibly rude again - nobody minds what he does, he just seems to lash back at family in the most unpleasant, disloyal way.Thereaposs also sort of nonsense there, or potential nonsense, because he says Meghan told him to get help, but when I interviewed him atin  I asked him aposAre you going because Meghan suggested it, has she persuaded youapos, and he said aposAbsolutely not, she had nothing to do with it, it was Williamapos. She suggested Harry gave an interview too soon after Philipaposs funeral. Senior royals, including the Queen, Charles and William, have already been back at work. Ms Levin said: Thereaposs a lack of understanding of anyone aposs position - poor Prince Charles, who as we saw when the funeral took place was absolutely devastated, and the Queen at  bravely went to open Parliament, but you could tell it was not the same Queen.

Harry, who is expecting a daughter with we Meghan and is already father to son Archie, aged two, compared his le to “a mixture between The Truman Show and being in a zoo”. Speaking on the podcast, he said: “There is no blame. I don’t think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting,I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on, basically. “It’s a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say ‘you know what, that happened to me, I’m going to make sure that doesn’t happen to you’.”  He added: “It’s hard to do but for me it comes down to awareness. I never saw it, I never knew about it, and then suddenly I started to piece it together and go ‘OK, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his le, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he’s treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids ’ “And here I am, I moved my whole family to the US, that wasn’t the plan but sometimes you’ve got make decisions and put your family first and put your mental health first.” He compared living under scrutiny as a member of the royal family to the  film The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey as a man oblivious to the fact that his entire le is a TV show, and to being an animal in a zoo. He also revealed that he met up with his future we in a London supermarket in the early days of their relationship and the couple pretended not to know each other. He said: “The first time Meghan and I met up for her to come and stay with me, we met up in a supermarket in London, pretending as though we didn’t know each other, texting each other from the other ends of the aisle. “There were people looking at me, giving me all of these weird looks, coming up to say hi or whatever but there I am texting her whilst we’re shopping, askingthis is the right thing and she’s replying ‘No, you want the parchment paper’. “It was nice with a baseball cap on looking down at the floor, walking along the street and trying to stay incognito. “Not sure how many times I’ve done that, trying to walk down the street and stay incognito is like ‘whoa signpost, someone’s dog’, it’s amazing how much chewing gum you see and how many shoes. “So living herenow I can actually lt my head and I feel dferent, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that.” The podcast follows Harry and Meghanaposs bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which was watched by tens of millions of people in March. The couple claimed a Royal Family member made a racist comment about their unborn son and the institution did not offer help to Meghan when she was in poor mental health.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRoyal FamilyPrince HarryMeghan Markle"},{"url":null,"title":"poor dog ends up looking","story":"NewsPoor dog ends up looking like Frank from Shameless after DIY home makeover goes wrongLeft with less than an inch of fur on his body, but a full, unruly head of golden fur on his head, poor Crusty has now been compared to scruffy alcoholic Frank Gallagher from the hit Channel Four series ShamelessmirrorShareCommentsByDanielle EltonNilufer Atik:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video dog-left-looking-like-shameless-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:cLsKZI,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

After all, just like his human owner, he’d had to forego his usual haircuts during lockdown too. But the unlucky mutt was left looking like a much ruff-er version of himself after the said owner decided to give him a DIY groom at home instead. Left with less than an inch of fur on his body, but a full, unruly head of golden fur on his head, the poor doggie has now been compared to scruffy alcoholic Frank Gallagher from the hit Channel Four series Shameless.  Photos and video footage of Crusty before and after his unfortunate makeover were posted on TikTok and quickly went viral, with .million views. Owner and poster @crustydog shared her attempt at a DIY groom with a caption that read: “Don’t attempt to groom your dog in iso.” The footage prompted tons of comments from Tik Tok users, remarking on who and what the unlucky animal now looks like.  One said: “That’s not a dog. That is a rat.” Another asked: “Is that a chicken ” A third commented: “Like when a looney tunes character gets burnt somehow lmaooo.” Others likened Crusty to a television star… but it wasn’t exactly a compliment.  One user joked: “Bahahahah ure dog looks like Frank from Shameless,” referring to the tramp-like main character in the series played by David Threlfall, and renowned for his shaggy, unwashed hair. “Okay but why does the dog look like Frank one Shameless.” said another. Other users, felt rather sorry for Crusty. “Until his hair grows back the humane thing to do is remove all mirrors from the home,” said one. Another added: “Dude grooming is so much harder than they make it look.” Crusty’s owner must be relieved dog groomers are now finally being allowed to reopen properly. During lockdown, groomers were only allowed to groom for welfare and not aesthetic purposes.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFrank GallagherChannel ShamelessViralDogsTikTokAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"popular man 20 took life","story":"NewsPopular man, , took le after struggling with domestic abuse he suffered as childMarc Palin was rushed to hospital after being found by people walking in a country park in Farnworth, Bolton on May  last year but sadly passed away just hours latermirrorShareCommentsByKit Vickery:,  MAY NewsPopular footballer Marc Palin,  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors had to tell his devastated family he would be severely brain damagedhe lived.But Marcaposs condition worsened during the night and he sadly died in the early hours of May , reports the Manchester Evening News.A hearing at Bolton coroneraposs court heard that the former Breightmet Wanderers AFC player had lived a dficult le.  Jenner Palin, his mum, wept as the court heard of the horric ordeal Marc’s father had put the pair of them through. The youngster watched on in horror as his dad brutally attacked his mum, stabbing her  times when he was just three years old. Whilst his mum recovered from her injuries, Marc was sent to live with a foster family in Cleveland, where he was subjected to abuse of his own, which was revealed years later during a counselling session. Marc reported the abuse to police, who told him that they couldn’t pursue any convictions because there was insufficient evidence, it was said. He was left “devastated” by the decision, the inquest heard, sparking a struggle with depression.  Assistant coroner Simon Nelson said on Thursday Marc had “opened a can of worms” by acknowledging the abuse, struggling to deal with the incident and feeling like no one believed him. Marc struggled to manage his mental health for years, being prescribed antidepressants and starting counselling in , before stopping this treatment a short time later. Karen Dalley, a mental health liaison practitioner at Royal Bolton Hospital, saw Marc just over  hours before he tried to take his own le. She said: “He expressed a lot of frustration about past trauma, his experiences in foster care, and frustration around the outcome of the investigation. “He said he felt empty inside but he was very specic in saying he didn’t want to end his le because he didn’t want to cause his parents any distress.

I think this was long standing and he wanted help - he was optimistic about his future.” Mrs Dalley spoke to Marc’s step-dad, Brian Palin, arranged to get a course of antidepressants prescribed and set up several referrals with mental health support groups who could help improve Marc’s wellbeing. Tragically, Marc continued to struggle, and made the decision to take his own le the next day. He left his family home in Red Lane, Breightmet, for the final time just after .pm. Recording a conclusion of “suicide whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed”, Mr Nelson said: “If only he would have been with someone,he had been able to verbalise those thoughts we may not have been here today. “I think that the events from his childhood have been a catalyst and the primary reason for him acting as he did. “I don’t believe he would have taken his own le had he not been so grievously affected by these events. “He was only  when he died but you have spoken about some very fine qualities. “You mention how caring he was, how he fought for the underdog - all very impressive traits which I hope he will be remembered for for many a year.” Samaritansoperates a -hour service available every day of the year.

Please reportyou see it and do not approach. It was being unloaded at Sandford and escaped. In Tesco Express area. Officers were also seen tending to a woman outside the Tesco Express shop on Hurricane Way, Woodley. Paul Breeds, who lives on Victor Way, said: My we saw it run down the road. I went over to Tesco Express and thataposs where I took the picture. It had worked its way around there.  Just after I took the picture, it ran towards me and I had to dodge out of the way. It missed butting me by about  inches, but even from there you could sense the power of it. I imagine itaposd be similar to being hit by a car. Most of the police I saw were PCSOs and they were doing a sterling job of warning people to keep clear. Jodie Louise Fox said she saw the cow getting knocked down by the police.  Eyewitnesses reported the strange sight along Victor Way and Hurricane Way in Woodley last night. The farm animal - described as angry by onlookers - then made its way another two miles to the A in Winnersh towards the M. Police closed the road in a bid to round it up. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: Officers were called yesterday at about .pm following reports that a cow was loose on a road near to the AM in Wokingham which was causing a signicant danger to motorists.Officers attended the scene, closed the road and attempts were made over a period of time to contain the animal. The cow then moved to a residential area of Woodley. Despite efforts of both the police and the farmer to whom the animal belonged, the cow could not be safely brought under control. The spokesman added that the animal became increasingly distressed and charged at a woman, leaving her minor injuries, before attacking a police officer and vehicles. Officers subsequently used a police vehicle to stop the cow and prevent it from charging towards other members of the public, the spokesman said. After all other options including tranquillisation were precluded, the cow was humanely euthanised at the scene by a private company. This decision whilst not taken lightly, was necessary to limit the suffering of the animal, to prevent further injury and to ensure the safety of the public. The injured Thames Valley Police officer has since been discharged from hospital and is recovering at home. We understand that there are some distressing videos circulating on social media relating to this incident, however we would like to reassure people that these measures were necessary and were only taken due to the need to protect the public, and were carried out in a way to minimise suffering to the animal.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCowsAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"receptionist 25 infected leg toes","story":"NewsReceptionist, , had to have infected leg and toes amputated after hot tub partyLauren Briggs, from Essex, was rushed to hospital after contracting meningococcal septicaemia at her friends house in January - where doctors removed her leg and toes while battling to save her lemirrorShareCommentsByCally BrooksJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsLauren said she was shocked when doctors explained her dip in the hot tub was the likely cause \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Lauren Briggs, , woke up at her friendaposs house unable to breathe in January after spending the evening having fun. She was rushed to hospital thanks to a quick-thinking pal, where she was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia. The le-threatening blood infection occurs when bacteria in the blood multiplies uncontrollably. Doctors battled to save Laurenaposs le and were forced to amputate her right leg below the knee and her toes on her left leg. The GPaposs receptionist, from Corringham, Essex, has now been left wheelchair-bound. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  Lauren said she was shocked when doctors explained her spell in the hot tub was the likely cause. She said: The night before, I had been in my friendaposs hot tub and doctors told me I may have contracted the infection through a small cut on my foot whilst in the hot tub. Hot tubs are filled with bacteria so itaposs likely that could have been the cause. I went to sleep that night feeling a bit nauseous but my friend found me in the early hours of the next morning gasping for breath on the floor.  The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital wondering what was going on. I was put on le support and was completely dependent on the machines for  hours. My feet were jet black they did multiple skin grafts from my left thigh to rebuild my feet but in the end, they couldnapost save my right leg or toes and they had to be amputated to save my le. Laurenaposs mum, Tracey, , added: I went straight to the hospital when I found out what had happened and when I arrived, I didnapost recognise my own daughter because she was so swollen and blue. I thought they had taken me to the wrong window when I saw her I fell to the floor and begged God to save her and not to let her go.  Sheaposs my only child - sheaposs my baby and doctors told me it was unlikely she would survive longer than  hours. They would regularly take Lauren down to theatre to clean the feet up and check everything and on this one particular day, she was in there all day and I knew something must have been happening. When I found out about the amputations, I dropped down on the floor again because I knew how this would impact her quality of le. She was discharged on April  but her le is completely dferent - it used to be just the two of us living together but now she has to stay in specialist accommodation that can cater for her wheelchair.

Bolton and Bury councils are asking secondary schools and colleges to keep face coverings in place until further notice following a surge in cases. The advice comes after the Government confirmed that it will remove the face mask requirement for pupils in England from Monday, when more indoor mixing is allowed when restrictions are lted further. A school leaders unionapos said it supported the schools which were planning to extend the use of face coverings among pupils beyond next week, adding that they are best placed to make the call.  MPs and parents have raised concerns about face masks in class disrupting pupilsapos learning and wellbeing since they were introduced in March, but unions and scientists have called for them to remain in class for longer to ensure pupils, staff, parents and the community are not put at risk of infection. The Indian iant of coronavirus has been detected in Bolton, Greater Manchester, as well as in Blackburn, Lancashire, and Sefton in Merseyside, which have all seen rates rise rapidly. The directors of public health from Lancashire County Council and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council are advising schools and colleges across the county to keep face masks in place until June . Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, Lancashire County Councilaposs director of public health, said: This is a very tough recommendation to make at a time when the restrictions are set to ease nationally on Monday May . But the increase in prevalence of this iant in the North West means we need to take some prudent steps to help reduce its spread.  Wearing face coverings in schools and colleges for a few weeks longer will help to contain this and ensure the iant doesnapost take hold. This is vital so we can build on the good work to keep levels of infection, hospital admissions and the numbers of people becoming seriously ill low. A letter from Bolton council to parents said it was asking schools to retain the use of face coverings, as per the current arrangements, until further notice. Bolton is the area with the highest rate of cases, with  new infections in the seven days to May . The letter, from the councilaposs childrenaposs services and public health directors, said: There have been instances where young people attending school or college have contributed to the spread of the virus. We believe it would be irresponsible to wait until we have higher levels of the newer iants of Sars-CoV circulating before we act.  A similar letter has been sent from Bury council to parents advising face masks to be retained in class and the council said all secondary schools and colleges in the area are following the advice. Julien Kramer, interim assistant director of education and inclusion at Bury council, wrote: We have made signicant progress in reducing cases of Covid-, there is a risk that this progress is undermined by the spread of this more infectious iant. Widespread transmission of this iant would risk slowing down or reversing the progress we have made towards removing restrictions on meeting family and friends and reopening businesses. I am sure that you will understand the need for caution at this time. Children at secondary schools in Selby, North Yorkshire, are also being advised to continue wearing masks beyond next week due to high transmission rates. Local director of public health Louise Wallace said: In consultation with education colleagues, we have therefore taken the common sense approach of suggesting schools consider continuing to use face coverings in those geographic areas where the Covid positive rates are highest. Seftonaposs public health team has also advised that masks should be worn in schools beyond Monday in areas which are currently experiencing outbreaks. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: We are aware that some schools are intending to extend the use of face masks among pupils beyond Monday. We back schools in the decisions they make. They best know their context and how their parents, staff, and pupils feel about the issue of face masks and they are therefore best placed to make a call on how to respond to the Governmentaposs guidance. There is also provision in the Government guidance for local action committees to reintroduce the use of face masks for pupils on a temporary basis in response to localised outbreaks, including iants of concern, and for decisions to be made by local directors of public health. There is clearly a great deal of concern about the iant which originated in India and the situation is obviously going to be fluid in the immediate future with regards to face masks.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationHospitalsSchoolsSecondary schoolIce skatingSarsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"top 20 things brits dreading","story":"NewsTop  things Brits dreading as restrictions ease after Covid slow lane leA study by Virgin Media commissioned to launch its free virtual assistant service, found Brits used to living in the slow lane with many anxious about le ing to normalmirrorShareCommentsByAlice Hughes:,  MAY NewsLe may be slowly getting back to normal but it could be overwhelming for some people\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Researchers found  per cent are now used to living in the aposslow laneapos and  per cent are not looking forward to le picking up pace again from Monday . Just over three in want to keep a balance of aposme timeapos and social plans as restrictions continue to ease. And  per cent of the , people polled went as far as to say they havenapost missed having a diary full of events. It also emerged that while  per cent are excited about getting their social le back,  per cent are anxious and  per cent feel nervous. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  A third are not looking forward to being in busy, crowded spaces in the near future and  per cent donapost want the pressure of making small talk. Instead, more than three in  would like to ease back into a busy social le post lockdown slowly rather than all at once. And one in six are stressed out at the thought of the amount of le admin and organisation that comes with multiple plans. A spokesperson for broadband provider Virgin Media, which commissioned the research to launch its free virtual assistant service, said: There are clearly mixed feelings about le after lockdown as we accelerate towards a post-restriction world.  After more than a year spent staying connected with loved ones online and socialising virtually, weaposre approaching another sht with many feeling overwhelmed by the growing number of social plans and le admin that come with it. And while adapting a new busier routine, almost a fth admitted theyaposd happily keep socialising virtually after lockdown with some video call get-togethers. The research reveals people have spent just under six hours rearranging events since March  so itaposs no surprise  per cent feel they would benefit from having a personal assistant to help ease them into a faster-paced routine.  The study also found  per cent arenapost looking forward to not being able to make appointments and bookings at venues like restaurants and bars. Since April th,  per cent have struggled to get an outdoor reservation and had to make an average of five attempts before they could make a booking, leaving them frustratedand disappointed . A further  per cent admitted they will find it annoying having to book in advance rather than making spontaneous plans in the future.  The average adult already has three social events booked in for May and is expecting to spend £ per month on average at social events this upcoming summer. Despite upcoming plans,  per cent have found not going out during lockdown relaxing, with almost one in five not looking forward to no longer having restrictions as an excuse to not see people. More than half of those polled via OnePoll have told a white lie in the past to get out of plans, with fake illness , tirednessand having to workamong the top excuses. Events people have tried to get out of with an exaggerated version of the truth include socialising with colleagues , friendsapos birthdaysand dinner with the in-laws .  Virgin Media has teamed up with TV personality Tom Read Wilson to provide a series of lockdown lting le hacks, including a virtual assistant service and an online tool to help people say no when they need to. Tom said: Itaposs important to remember to pause and practice the art of moderation when reconnecting with loved ones and adjusting to a busier routine - the last thing we want is social burnout. And for those who need a bit of assistance wriggling their way out of unwanted plans or simply want to continue to embrace the joy of missing out, they can head to my apospolite decline generatorapos for some inspiration on how to say no with grace.  Virgin Mediaaposs spokesperson added: Everyone will have a dferent approach to adjusting to le after lockdown with a fth of those surveyed saying they will continue to socialise virtually on some occasions. So whether theyaposre out and about meeting friends, catching up with family online, or sat solo on the sofa, weaposre helping the nation bounce back however they choose. Top  things people are not looking forward to when restrictions continue to ease . Being in busy or in crowded spaces e.g. bars. Waiting in queues. Wearing a mask. Spending lots of money. Getting public transport. Making small talk. Not being able to use the lockdown restrictions as an excuse to not see people. Not being able to get an appointment   booking e.g. at pubs, restaurants, hairdressers. Talking about lockdown. Commuting. Constantly feeling tired.

Or that is what he’d have the world believe following an interview this week. In a podcast, he told American actor Dax Shepard that only by moving , miles to the US west coast has he been able to break free from his “genetic pain”. Quite how much “genetic pain” his words cause those with whom he actually shares his genes – his brother, his father, the Queen – cannot be imagined. But certainly his new family we Meghan, friends Oprah Winfrey, James Corden and Gayle King have nothing but pride for his new-found “honesty”. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Over here, Harry’s words, spoken with new American upspeak, put him at the centre of a new outrage.Just as his family comes to terms with Prince Philip ’s death, Harry fired: “When it comes to parenting,I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on.”Piers Morgan, who quit Good Morning Britain after a row over Meghan’s Oprah chat, was incensed: “How many more times is this spoiled brat going to publicly trash the dad who’s bankrolled him his entire le ” For someone who fled the UK to get out of the limelight, Harry has been carrying out an extraordinary number of interviews and public appearances.  Less than a fortnight ago he received a standing ovation after giving a speech at the Vax Live concert in Los Angeles. The dust is yet to settle on his Oprah interview which left the royal family feeling scorched, which quickly followed his prime-time chat with James Corden. Some might feel his personal outpourings are best kept to the privacy of a therapist’s office. Yet his fans agree it is only by distancing himself from his family and talking about his “trauma” that he is going to be able to become a good father to his two-year-old son and soon-to-be-born daughter.  For all the sense of duty we have seen from our Queen, Charles and William, their family situation has been unusual at best. Dysal at worst. Among the palaces, privileges, titles, land, jewels and fortunes handed down there have been unwelcome traits too. Harry grew up the son of a woman who suffered bulimia and mental health disorders. Traumatised by her parents’ acrimonious orce and custody battle when she was only seven, she was haunted by her mum Frances leaving the family home for a le with lover Peter Shand Kydd.  Close friends said the experience left Diana feeling needy and fragile. She was plagued with insecurities, suffered bulimia and is said to have attempted suicide. A similar pattern of marital disharmony scarred her sons. Prince Charles had an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now Harry’s stepmum. Diana believed it went on throughout the marriage.  Harry was sent to boarding school at eight, Eton at  and joined the British Army at . His parents separated in a blaze of publicity when he was eight and both admitted adultery on national television. He lost his mother aged . Harry’s relationship with his father has suffered. Charles stopped taking his calls after he fled Britain and their reunion at Philip’s funeral was said to be frosty.  The broken father-son bond also repeats that of the previous generation. Charles was forced by his father to go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the s and hated its toughening-up exercises, like a daily run and cold shower. During world tours, the Queen and Philip left Charles with nannies for months. They were so emotionally and physically distant, reunions were celebrated with pecks on the cheek and formal handshakes.  Harry can now see some of his dad’s parenting was just learned behaviour. He said: “I started to piece it tog-ether and go, ‘OK, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his le, I know it’s connected to his parents so that means he’s treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my kids ’” This does not question the royal family’s service to our nation, but it does question what it must be like to grow up in it. Perhaps, as Harry suggests, it was a cycle of genetic pain. Psychologist Dr Pam Spurr says: “A person can successfully make a complete break from it by having an emotional and physical break, and not seeing their family. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. Sometimes that allows them to clear the slate and rebuild a new foundation.” Harry has chosen to uproot, but whether he is right to share his pain publicly is a dferent manner. He is at risk of turning the royal family into a posh episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show. Charles would not answer questions about Harry’s comments on Friday. Prince Philip said in : “I’ve never discussed private matters and I don’t think the Queen has either. Very few members of the family have.” Harry is breaking the cycle. Many of us Britons, particularly the older generation, will never be able to forgive anyone for airing dirty laundry. Younger people seem more forgiving. And let’s not forget this is Mental Health Awareness Week when people are encouraged to discuss feelings. However we cannot know how the feelings of the Queen, Charles and William have been affected by Harry’s emotional outpourings – or whether those feelings can ever be repaired.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyMental healthParenting"},{"url":null,"title":"up five visitors allowed per","story":"NewsUp to five visitors to be allowed per resident in care homes from MondayThe change comes as the nation moves into the next phase of its lockdown roadmap, the Department of Health and Social Care said, with named visitors allowed to attend two at a time or separately in updated guidancemirrorShareCommentsByTess de la MareJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe change comes as the nation moves into the next phase of its lockdown roadmap \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

To limit the infection risk, care home residents may not have more than two visitors in a day. Residents with special care needs may chose to nominate an essential carer as one of their five visitors. The carer will be exempt from the two visitors-a-day limit. Named visitors should be regularly tested, wear appropriate personal protective equipment and maintain social distancing, the DHSC said.

The centre at Hirshmanaposs Chemist in Sefton, Merseyside , is near Formby, which has seen a rise in coronavirus cases with the Indian iant detected.Yesterday it was announced that surge testing had been rolled out to parts of Sefton, Merseyside, after cases of the India iant of coronavirus were found. In a bid to protect its population, the jab rollout is being extended to over-s in the town way ahead of the national schedule, Liverpool Echo reported.A member of staff at Hirshman Pharmacy in Ainsdale confirmed the vaccination centre began taking walk-in vaccinations from pm today. The move comes after the area saw a surge in positive tests in the last week, which resulted in the closure of a pub and multiple schools sending classes home to isolate.Have you got your hands on a jab today in Sefton  Email webnews@mirror Some parts of Formby in Sefton have seen the number of positive cases rise by five times in just a week. Seftonaposs response to rising infections came after David Greenhalgh, the leader of Bolton council, hinted that the UK government would give permission for surge vaccinations in certain areas. He is one of a number of local leaders who had asked ministers to let them vaccinate all over-s in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly. “This is an issue of capacity but we have had very, very constructive talks and certainly all the soundings are that they are looking to progress that as soon as possible, he said,reported.  Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi has told people living in Sefton, as well as Bolton, to get tested so the India iant outbreak could be controlled. He said: We need to work together, those viewers from Formby and Bolton where we are surge testing we can all play our part. Those people need to do two tests a week, thenyouaposre positive do a PCR test. Weaposre doing the surge testing and in Bolton weaposre doing the door to door testing as we know that works. The vaccination programme, genome sequencing, and please isolateyou test positive, thataposs the only way we break the cycle.  The response comes amid growing alarm surrounding the India iant. Four people have now died after contracting the mutant strain, Public Health England announced. The latest total was announced on Friday amid a surge in cases and urgent measures to halt the spread of the mutant iant which has been spreading rapidly in some areas. Cases of the B... iant have more than doubled in the UK - from  to , - in a week as lockdowns are eased.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus vaccineAndrew MarrPriti PatelEducationPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"we should praise prince harry","story":"NewsopinionWe should praise Prince Harry for being brave enough to speak out - it will do so much goodPrince Harry spoke openly and honestly about the struggles hes faced and the therapy hes had on Dax Shepherds podcast, Armchair ExpertmirrorShareCommentsByPolly Hudson:,  MAY NewsopinionHarry is now living in the US with his family \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Globally.He knows this, has wrestled with it, but in giving an interview to podcast Armchair Expert seems to have finally worked out how to use it to his advantage, for the greater good.On Dax Shepherd’s podcast – which I haven’t missed an episode of for three years – you get the polar opposite of every celebrity interview you’ve ever heard.This is not fluffy, light, blatant promotion of whatever project they’re publicising, trotting out tired old anecdotes and cliches about how the cast and crew became like family. On Dax’s podcast, people get real. As the host says, by way of introduction, “I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment.” Harry being brave enough to go on this show, where there is nowhere to hide, and speaking openly about the struggles he’s faced, the therapy he’s done, is simply wonderful. Talking about mental health issues makes them less taboo, and allows those battling them to know that they’re far from alone. Anyone wondering whether they’re making a fuss over nothing, beating themselves up thinking they should be able to cope because others have it worse can listen to a literal PRINCE admitting to finding le hard sometimes, and give themselves a break.Harry is a fantastic advert for therapy, not just because he credits it with helping him so much, but just in his whole manner. He’s relaxed, content, at ease. He’s aware of the realities of his le, and is determined to keep all that he has learned and experienced in the forefront of his mind as he parents his children. Listening to him chatting, laughing, being so honest, you get the sense that this is a man who used to have the weight of the world on his shoulders, and now, after some undoubtedly challenging work, has been relieved of that burden. So much of Royal le is about service, and although Harry is taking a dferent, much more controversial route, there can be no doubt that he is still very much providing that here. This interview will have helped many, many people, and will do for years to come.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryRoyal FamilyMental healthTherapy"},{"url":null,"title":"woman 20 who shed 9","story":"NewsWoman, , who shed  stone in lockdown quits job and becomes personal trainerDora Mancini Newton, from Glasgow, only joined the gym after her husband suggested she tag along during his visits but is now switching from her career as a computer technicianmirrorShareCommentsByCarla Jenkins:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDora shed nine stone after learning to love the gym \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. Dora said: My journey over the past year and a half has been amazing. I have loved every minute of it and the hard work has been worth every single bit. Watching my body changing and watching the scales going down has been amazing. In total I have lost nine stone. I have had an amazing support system behind me including family and friends. [I] couldnapost have done it without there motivation and support. Dora, from Glasgow, said her journey started before lockdown when she decided to join a gym with her husband. The pair signed up to get rid of the stresses of their family-run business, she said.  Dora explained: It was not my idea to start the gym at all as Iaposve always been quite scared to join a gym and always been self-conscious of my weight. But my husband decided he wanted to join to help with mental health and stress he was under. Anyone who knows us knows as a couple we do everything together - eat, sleep, work ,live, socialise...so naturally I decided to tag along.

So I approached a personal trainer called Scott Atkinson who transformed my outlook, drive and canapost thank him enough. He has been amazing and trains both my husband Kyle and I. At the start of my personal training, I did full body workouts with a mix of cardio and weight training included.  It was nothing too intensive anda movement or exercise wasnapost for me or I didnapost like it it was changed instantly to something I was comfortable with. Unfortunately then lockdown hit - and the gym closed. But Dora managed to source some equipment at home so she could keep up her training. She added that, prior to her new diet, one of her worst habits was overeating. But she has now learnt to eat in moderation and control the calories. Dora said: My diet didnapost change at all at the start as Scott wanted to see my eating habits. I also suffer from a lot of food allergies so couldnapost eat foods that you would typically eat on a aposdietapos like nuts, fruits and certain vegetables.

Dora said that her regular training actually became a crutch for her and husband Kyle throughout lockdown, when their small business was forced to close during a time she described as dficult.

Claire Waldron has decided to put the three bedroom home she owns in Magheraboy, County Fermanagh on offer to be won.Whoever bags the lucky raffle ticket, which cost £ a piece, will bag themselves a semi-detached property boasting brand new appliances, stylish furniture and a huge garden area, the Irish Mirror reported. The -year-old bought the three bedroom house in  and moved in that year when her daughter was just nine. Now,  years later, Claire is raffling off the family home to raise money for her favourite animal charity, The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .  Claire says that before the pandemic she got a new kitchen in, all the new furniture, I did up my bedroom. It hasn’t been used much, no family parties of course, so it’s ready to go. “The reason I’m doing thatisI haven’t found somewhere to live after the raffle I’ll have to worry about storage and removal and it’s just a hassle. You can buy furniture anywhere.” Along with a fully furnished home, Claire is even leaving £, to the lucky winner. “I’m sure people will want to paint it their own way, she said.  I’ve got a few complaints about tiles at my front door. I have had emails saying ‘I don’t like your tiles, I’m not buying a ticketapos. “Everyone’s got their own personal taste, that’s why I’m giving €,as well, for people to be able to put their own mark on it.” The raffle will see  per cent of ticket revenue donated to the ISPCA, after Raffall, the raffle hosting website, has taken commission. “ per cent out of , ticket sales, it works out at about €, or €,,” she explains. With  days left to enter, there are over , raffle tickets sold so far. As support grows across social media and the ISPCA soon to get on board with advertising the fundraiser, Claire hopes to reach her goal of , tickets sold by October.“I’ve had contact with them , I’ve had to sign letters to say that this is kosher and that I am going to donate the money… so theyaposre going to get on board and start sharing it on their Instagram page, which will help, she continued.For the self-proclaimed “crazy dog lady,” choosing to donate to the ISPCA was a no-brainer. “There’s no actual rescue centres in Sligo, she said.  There’s Leitrim animal rescue which is the next county over and then there’s North West which covers Mayo… So the ISPCA has been covering all the trouble that the countyhas had. “I thought I’d pick them. They’re pretty central. They cover the whole of Ireland and they need the funds. Just like any other rescue centre.” Claire has run Walkies Doggy Daycare, a boarding and dog-walking service since  and says looking after animals is her “bread and butter.” “My daughter has three dogs and I have two dogs so there’s dogs everywhere, she said. Her daughter is expecting her first child this summer and Claire has plans to move into a smaller home with plenty of room for more canine activities. “It would be nice to move somewhere closer to my daughter, mind the kid and mind dogs, the mum said. On leaving her home she says: “I do love my house but I want more garden space, more land, shed units or an expansion so that I can have more dogs.” As well as expanding the “doggy daycare,” Claire is planning on fostering and adopting more dogs when she has the space to do so.  “The amount of people that got dogs during Covid is crazy. They’re all going to be going back to work this year or maybe next year, the rescue centres are going to be full and theyaposre already full to capacity.” “There’s no rescue centre in Sligo and I just want to be able to do something, animals are my le.” When asked of any plans for choosing potential new properties she says she’s not allowing herself to become attached to anywhere yet, “properties are being snapped up because everyone wants to get out of the city,” she explains. “I’m not getting my hopes up or setting my heart on anything until the end of July or August, when I know what the raffle situation is.” She says that raffling her house to raise money has been keeping her busy over lockdown. “I was bored s**tless. During lockdown, I really wanted a project, Claire said. “You have to be on social media all the time, posting stories, you have to keep the house clean, posting pictures, answering the phone.” And she isn’t alone. Raffling houses online has become a new fad with tickets being sold for a chance to win houses across the country. Claire was first inspired by a house raffled off in Waterford. Since then there have been houses raffled in Kilkenny, Wexford and one currently being raffled in Donegal. While some people are selling their homes via raffle in a bid to make a profit, others like Claire are donating proceeds to charity. “The family in Donegal are doing it for Beaumont , Claire said.

Brianna Walton, , feared her seven-month-old kitten Gracie could be sick, after she started losing huge clumps of fur. The cat lover, from Maine in the United States, was fostering two adult cats when one gave birth to a litter of kittens which contained Gracie. Brianna, who works as a photographer, decided to keep hold of Gracie as a pet for herself, but at just five weeks old she realised something wasnapost right when she began losing all of her fur.  Gracie was about five weeks old when she started to lose facial hair, she recalled. She then lost most of her hair completely over the next two weeks and I became very concerned that she was sick so I brought her to the vet. “They did one look over with no tests and concluded it was probably a fever but that she was perfectly healthy otherwise and needed no further special attention.” While Brianna was convinced her pet feline mightaposve been suffering with some kind of undiagnosed illness, she was completely baffled when a vet said it was actually caused by a rare genetic mutation, making her a wolf-cat.  Wolf-cats, which are also known as Lykoi, are domestic cats with just one coat of fur that molts every six months, leaving them with a striking resemblance to werewolves. After learning that her cat is in fact healthy, Brianna started sharing clips of the unique looking feline on TikTok, and she quickly became a viral sensation, thanks to her unusual appearance. Gracie looks like a werewolf and I think thataposs the coolest, Brianna said. I had hoped it mightbecause I truly felt like she was one-of-a-kind kitty with a very special story, so I am glad it did. “People say they had never heard of a wolf cat but now that they have, they need one.”Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

From old family photos to unfashionable furniture and old school trophies, this is one of the areas of the home that can often tell hundreds of stories. But when one woman looked in her attic recently, she was left stunned to find a huge, unusual structure attached to the ceiling.Taking to Facebook, the homeowner in Australia asked social media users for help with identying the object which looked like plaster or foam.With a stunned emoji, the woman asked: “Anyone know what kind of nest this is ”  One user replied: “I think you need an exorcist for that.” Another added: “How do I un-see these photos  Instructions please.” It was later agreed in the comments that the nest belonged to European wasps, meaning that an unidentied number of the wasps were potentially living in the attic. The homeowner updated her post to name the nest and she then thanked the commenters for their “input and a good laugh”. She added: “They won’t reinhabit a dormant nest and it will naturally break down over time. It’s made from chewed wood and saliva.”Speaking to News.au, ecologist and University of Sydney professor Dieter Hochuli confirmed the origin of the mystery nest and advised that a pest control specialist should be called.Pest control teams would be able to identythe nest was active and then be able to plan for its safe removal. Professor Hochuli also warned about the dangers of the wasps to humans. He said: “[The wasps] can cause anaphylaxis but it isn’t particularly common. People who know they are susceptible will often carry kits to treat itthey do go into shock.” The professor added that the nests get bigger during the warmer parts of the year when the queen wasps look after the wasp larvae until they are able to become workers.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeLike other observers and academics, I used to think the two-state solution was the most effective means for Israel-Palestine peace. That plan is dead now. A one-state solution has become a reality with equal rights for Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. What has led to the collapse of the two-state plan  First, since the Six-Day War of June  Israel’s occupation and control of Palestinian land and le has become deeply entrenched. More than half a million Jewish settlers and counting dominate the hills and fertile land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Far from independent, the Palestinian authority led by Mahmoud Abbas s mainly as a contractual security coordinator with the Israeli military occupation. Second, after decades of international and Israel human rights organizations warning that Israel’s control of Palestinian le might lead to apartheid, the “threshold” has now been crossed, according to a new, well-documented report, by Human Rights Watch. Indeed, one of the more startling new findings in the HRW report is that even the Palestinians living in Israel are subjected to a form of apartheid rule.  The HRW report asserts that nearly seven million Palestinians in the occupied territories and within Israel itself face collective persecution under an apartheid system. Third, Donald Trump’s decision to unilaterally and illegally gt the remaining bit of historical Palestine to Benjamin Netanyahu not only destroyed the framework of a two-state solution but has also made the one-state solution or a bi-national state with citizenship and equal rights for both communities the only option available to advance a just and lasting resolution to this conflict. Yes, the international community still supports a two-state plan, international law favours two states, and most Israelis oppose a one-state solution and demand a Jewish state.  Not only that but the two main Palestinian partiesoppose a one-state solution. But they have more to gain than to lose in accepting a one-state plan. So instead of paying lip service to the fancul notion of a two-state solution, the international community, including the UK, should support a bi-national or a federaldemocratic state with equal rights for all citizens.  As long as the US supports Israel, unconditionally, Israel has no incentive to change there is room here for the UK and the EU to play a more constructive role.Fawaz Gerges is a professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.

On hearing of a ground invasion on Thursday evening Gaza’s gunmen were ordered immediately into their tunnel networks to intercept Israeli infantry – and were bombed with huge bunker-buster missiles. Sources told the Daily Mirror on Friday the toll of Hamas fighters may run into several hundred with one saying: “I believe it may have been at least  or more fighters.” The devastating and brutal deception was launched by the Israeli Defence Force tweeting they were attacking from the ground and air. This was immediately interpreted as a “ground invasion” but in fact meant tanks, artillery and air-strikes were being launched.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.

to Dens Park on Saturday.Dundee#s biggest name player, Adam, turned up on the big night, with two trademark through balls cutting the home defence wide open.His precision, combined with the timing of McGhee’s running and cool finishing, saw the Dark Blues take a two-goal lead.More than setting up the goals, though, Adam was a leader in the middle of the park.Not only by talking his team-mates through the contest and taking charge when needed but by dishing out the verbals to the opposition players when the chance came too.Dundee’s captain hasn’t had the best few months, being out of the team for ious reasons.However, with promotion chances on the line, he’s the man for Dundee in the big moments.It’s only one game in a potential four but so far he’s delivering for his team.And boy did he deliver for the barnstorming runs of McGhee.Moving the defender into an all-action midfield role has worked an absolute treat for James McPake.In fact, Dundee have never lost a football match with McGhee in that role.A remarkable stat # but maybe not so remarkable when he puts in performances like Wednesday.He most certainly didn’t finish his chances like a defender.The first was anything but easy # but McGhee made it look simple.And when the goal was gaping in front of him in the second half, there was no fluffing of the lines.Along with Shaun Byrne anchoring the midfield, that’s where Dundee won this first leg.James McPake went for the ‘-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it’ approach to his tactics on the night.The last time the teams met, the Dark Blues came out on top.The Kirkcaldy side were far better this time around in possession early on but as the Dark Blues grew into the game, Raith shrank.Then Dundee’s quality told.Raith got most joy in the opening period down the flanks.Dan Armstrong certainly caused problems for left-back Cammy Kerr early onAfter fearing he’d be out for the season, the hope was first choice Jordan Marshall wouldin time for the play-off push.However, he managed just two training sessions prior to Wednesday night’s contest and was only fit enough to take a place on the bench.Kerr has been a more than able stand-in recently but he was up against something dferent this time around – for  minutes anyway.The first nutmeg was too heavy for Armstrong to catch but the winger pulled another off before the half-time whistle.Christie Elliott, an attacker throughout much of his career, can be caught out defensively too.Raith got a bit of joy in those areas in the first half but Dundee shut that door after the break.Their quality further up the pitch saw the Dark Blues take control of the scoreline.With it, the pressure was taken off the backline, with both Kerr and Christie subsequently playing a huge role in earning their clean sheet.Dundee most certainly have the tie in their hands ahead of the second leg at Dens Park on Saturday night.Raith, though, have shown all season they are too good a side to just go away.The first leg is in the bag for James McPake and his team – however, there can be no complacency despite their three-goal lead.There is still work to be done.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox

constant questions over the absence of Dundee captain Charlie Adam earlier this season.The Dark Blues skipper had to be patient on hisfrom Covid- and take a place on the bench as the team’s form took off.At Dunfermline, despite the club searching for a winner, Adam was an unused sub and rumours began of a fall-out between the player and manager.The Dens boss brought up that rumour personally in a press conference to address the issue.Adam admits he did search out reasons for his absence from the side from McPake at the time.Speaking to the Athletic, he said: “Dundee is a small city and I heard someone askwe had a falling-out but we had a conversation like a manager and player should.“I went to see him when I wasn’t playing to have an explanation and I got one. That’s how it should be.“There is a trust and honesty from the manager and I have a great relationship with him. We both want what’s best for Dundee.”After a man of the match display for Adam in the crucial first leg of their play-off semi-final against Raith Rovers, McPake says the decision to take things slow with his key man is paying off.Returning to the starting XI in recent weeks, the -times capped Scotland international led his side to key wins over Raith and Queen of the South to secure second place.He outdid himself, however, with two superb assists for Jordan McGhee in Kirkcaldy on Wednesday night before sending Max Anderson away to lay on a third goal for Osman Sow.It was a performance McPake says makes him proud to be Adam’s manager.“Questions have been asked about why he wasn’t in the team and it annoyed me,” the Dundee boss said.“You’ve got to look at the time he’s had since he came back up the road.“You could see his celebration when the third goal went in– this club means the world to him.➡️ https:t.co tkIwnm pic oyXczNdhmdash Dundee Football ClubMay , “Unfortunately he lost a parent and then had a really bad spell with Covid.“There were questions at Inverness about why he wasn’t on from the start in that game. He was working up to a level and I think we saw that on Wednesday.“I think it was the right decision. Charlie thought it was the right decision.“We were on a good run, then, too.“For everything he gives you and everything he’s got, he’s a human being who takes knocks. And he’s had a couple of horrendous knocks this year.“To perform like that on Wednesday, I’m delighted for him. This club means the world to him and he’s as big a fan as I know.“I’m proud of him and proud of all my players.”Dundee play-off analysis: Dark Blues in control of Raith Rovers semi-final thanks to midfield power couple\" title\"#Dundee play-off analysis: Dark Blues in control of Raith Rovers semi-final thanks to midfield power couple# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-analysis-dark-blues-in-control-of-play-off-semi-final-thanks-to-midfield-power-couple embed # secretEbPjhwazM\" data-secret\"EbPjhwazM\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/medw-dynamo-robert-lindsay-9_28651986-558x372.jpg ","title":"six degrees north north east brewery to shut two pubs in the central belt as they refocus their efforts on the region","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remSix Degrees North is shutting its two central belt premises in order to #refocus# their efforts on the north-east.The Stonehaven-born business has announced plans to close their premises in Glasgow and Edinburgh due to the effects of Covid.Three of their bars, in Aberdeen, Stonehaven and Dundee will remain open.Founder Robert Lindsay revealed why they had made the #dficult# and #seemingly impossible# decision to shut two venues.He said: #Six°North is a business that has an international inspiration, but our heart belongs in the North East of Scotland. Our family, friends and the majority of our team are all here.#What is important to me is that Six°North continues its journey without losing its soul, and continues to offer opportunity and reward to those that have been committed to our business over the last eight years.#After over twelve months of reflection, it’s obvious to me that the current business structure cannot deliver this.#To achieve this we must take a small step back, consolidate our business in the short term, and be in as strong a position as possible as markets and opportunities open up again post-Covid.#We have made the dficult, and sometimes a seemingly impossible decision, to refocus on our efforts and operations in the North East.#This means we intend to build on what we have created in Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Laurencekirk, and Dundee. It also means saying goodbye to Six°North Edinburgh and Six°North Glasgow.#Six Degree North#s first bar was opened on Littlejohn Street in Aberdeen in June , two months after they first started out next door to the Marine Hotel in Stonehaven.They then moved to larger brewery premises in Laurencekirk in October , where they expanded their brewing capacity.A second bar was opened on Dumbarton Road in Glasgow in March , before a third was opened on Howe Street in Edinburgh five months later.Their last premises was unveiled in December  on Union Street in Dundee.The future is still bright for the brewery as they aim to consolidate their business across the north-east of Scotland.Their premises in Glasgow has been taken over by another bar but continue to serve Six Degrees North, while their Edinburgh home has yet to find new owners.Mr Lindsay spoke about his #great love# for both of the venues, their customers, staff, and communities surrounding them.He added: #We have many beers yet to brew, many drinkers yet to meet and some wonderfully exciting opportunities to develop.#We have an ability to create erse products and services within the brewing, hospitality, and tourism sector, but this will not be best realised for us by operating venues from afar.#It is the end for our central belt venue adventure, we are not ing home with our tail between our legs, but proud of what we brought, when we brought it, the staff that helped us, and the customers that came through the door.#We will be forever grateful and honoured to have served these people and to have been part of their communities.#Six°North may be ing home, but we are very much looking forward to writing the next stage of our adventure and continuing to catch up with our friends further afield.#The brewery will continue to supply its beers across the whole of Scotland and the UK.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

He suffered a heart attack in  which resulted in open heart surgery and a triple bypass operation and was diagnosed with leukemia in .On his Total Giving page, Mr McArthur said: #So far, fingers crossed, I am fighting fit and up for a challenge.#Following his day  climb, he said: #It#s going fine so far. It#s getting quite tough but I#ll be able to do it all as long as my knees don#t give out.#I#m quite fit, but I was a bit worried because I hadn#t done more than two consecutive trial runs.#I#m just taking it one day at a time. That#s my strategy, my goal each day is to just get another climb out the way.#Although it would be nicethe weather was better.#Mr McArthur has continued to climb through snow, sleet and hail stones and at times cannot see more than a few feet ahead. He has completed some of the climbs solo while friends have joined him for others.He added: #I#ve had some friends climb with me which has been really nice, it#s good to have someone to talk to.#Mr McArthur is raising funds for GEF to celebrate his th birthday this year.

We have  players wearing fancy dress in the square and it is always a nice day out for everyone.#Some of the money raised from the tournament in  was supposed to go to GEF, but when it was cancelled I promised I would raise money in . When Covid stopped that too, I decided I had to do something myself.#When I was coming up with this crazy scheme the travel restrictions were still in place, so I had to find something I could do within a five mile radius. I was sitting looking at Mither Tap from my window and that#s when I created this monster of a challenge for myself.#For his day eight climb, Mr McArthur was joined by his friend Ben Riddell, personal trainer at The Le Coach, who has been working with him for the past three years.Mr Riddell said: #I first met Neil after his heart surgery when he came to seethe gym would be suitable for him. He has progressed so much with his fitness and we#ve now developed a friendship.#He came to me a couple months ago with this idea to climb Bennachie every day in May and askedI thought he could do it. I said yes, but that he had to prep and get into the right mindset.#We came up with a plan for going up and worked out a schedule so he could get to the very top every day.#I climbed up with him on Saturday morning which was an absolute pleasure. He is an inspiration to me and many others and it#s been a privilege to train him and help him back to health over the past three years.#The -year-old said Mr Riddell was #instrumental# in his recovery and in his preparations for this challenge.He added: #Open heart surgery is very debilitating.

would like to hear from former pupils and staffhave any pictures of memories they would like to share.“Quite often there is a long relationship with Westfield going from primary right through to secondary school.“We would also be keen to hear from parents of former pupils about some of their personal journey.“We have had a lot of pupils who come to us and they cannot speak but by the time they leave they are verbal.“It is little things like that we are trying to share.”As part of the celebrations, the current pupils will compile the material alongside any other photographs or stories and create a video which would be shared on the school’s Youtube account.The school#s headteacher Kerri Dalton appealed for those with a connection with the school to come forward and help with the

of Scotland’s coronavirus tiered system for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.The region, which has been plagued by rising cases of Covid- in recent weeks, has been kept in the heightened level of restrictions as the rest of mainland Scotland moves to Level  from Monday.Earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon said the region was “most likely” to remain in the enhanced level until the virus spread is brought back under control.And on Friday afternoon Ms Sturgeon confirmed the news, saying: #It is prudent for Moray to remain in level three for a further week so that we can be more confident that the situation is firmly under control.#The position will be reviewed at the end of next week at which point I hope Moray will move to level two#.Moray experienced a surge in cases this week with the infection rate hitting more than  per , of population.The decision to remain in Level  comes as NHS Grampian accelerates the vaccination programme to include all those over the age of , with all expected to be vaccinated by the end of the month.Case numbers have dropped in recent days with NHS Grampian welcoming the “encouraging signs”.Only two cases were recorded in Moray yesterday, a third of all cases in Grampian.Moray Council#s chief executive Roddy Burns has issued a statement following the Scottish Government#s announcement that Moray will remain in level three restrictions from Monday.He said: #I know it’ll be disheartening for Moray residents and businesses, and those with plans to visit the area, that we’ll remain in Level  of restrictions from Monday. There’s reassurance that Moray is doing well, we’re just not there yet. So we’re optimistic that extended restrictions will only be for a short time, and we’ll soon be joining the rest of mainland Scotland in Level  and enjoying more of the freedoms that come with this relaxation.“This is only a possibility due to the huge community effort in the last couple of weeks. We’ve seen a % increase in testing, and thousands of residents have been rolling up their sleeves as part of the accelerated vaccination programme. My heartfelt thanks to our council and NHS colleagues delivering testing and vaccinations, to all those who have taken part, and to those in our business community who have helped facilitate this. These measures are vital in driving down transmission of the virus here in Moray, and we’re making progress – let’s keep at it.“Meantime we can still support local businesses safely as we pull together to get out of this particularly challenging period, as we prepare to welcome visitors back to Moray – responsibly – as soon as possible.”Deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, Chris Littlejohn, said: “The number of new cases identied each day has levelled off over the past week. Around % of new infections are in those linked to known clusters and settings, up from around a third when concern was growing about Moray numbers. This flattening of case numbers, and the reduction in new infections where the source is unknown, suggests that the community outbreak across Moray is coming under control. We are grateful for the continuing willingness of people to get tested, so that cases and contacts can be found and isolated, to now begin bringing the number of new infections down.“This progress has been made because people are doing the right things – getting tested, sticking to the guidelines and self-isolating when required to. Vaccination continues at pace, and our testers and contact tracers continue to work tirelessly to support the area.“The current restrictions and interventions appear to be working. This is not the moment to lower our guard. But we hope we can see the end of the current outbreak not too far aheadwe stick with it, and by another few weeks we should see the further impact from the accelerated vaccination program.“The incident management team view is that we need to see a sustained drop in cases, a drop in the rates per ,, and a sustained drop in the R-rate to below one before restrictions should be loosened in Moray. With numbers flattening already that will hopefully be achievable sooner rather than later.“We also need to ensure that when we do relax that cases are at a low enough level it is sustainable and numbers won’t rocket  days later again.“We’ve seen a huge collective effort from the people of Moray, who are working alongside us to #ProtectMoray, and for that we cannot thank you enough.”For as

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

million investment programme, which took place over the course of three months.A number of important projects were successfully completed, including the replacement of the low-pressure turbine rotor, turbine valve inspections and detailed inspections of the graphite core.At its peak, more than  people were present on site including visiting contractors.Despite this, both industrial and Covid- safety were maintained.Tam Albishawi, station director at the power station to the east of Dunbar, was pleased with how the outage had gone.He said: ldquoOutages are always planned scrupulously to ensure they run well and we took the same approach to managing Covid during an outage.ldquoAs well as putting in place a strict testing regime, we ensured the enforcement of social distancing, regular hand washing and mandatory mask wearing on site.ldquoI am glad that the measures we put in place kept rates so low, keeping people on site and in the community safe.ldquoIn addition to tackling the usual big maintenance projects, the team have also inspected the reactorrsquos graphite core as part on an ongoing inspection programme happening at each of our stations and these checks have confirmed that all is as expected.ldquoEveryone involved worked really hard to make sure we were able to deliver one of our best ever outages and I am delighted that the unit is back online and helping Britain achieve net zero.Covid was a particular focus of the outage, which had been postponed from summer last year to allow for better arrangements to be introduced nationally and at the site.EDF acted early to introduce ldquostringent protective measures including social distancing, mandatory face masks, thermographic cameras and working from home, where possible, which helped keep on-site rates consistently low.The company also invested in mass testing capability and required visiting contractors to register a negative test before entering the site, as well as at least weekly testing for all those working there.A spokeswoman for EDF said: ldquoOver the -week outage period, we carried out almost , tests and recorded  Covid positive cases.ldquoAlmost all of these cases were asymptomatic and detected due to the rigorous testing regime put in place by EDF to protect those on site and in the wider community.ldquoThe ability to identy these cases meant that workers were able to immediately self-isolate while close contacts were traced and asked not to come to site. All cases were reported to public health authorities.The outage, which got under way in January, also boosted the local economy, with a number of the key workers staying in local hotels.Last year, Torness generated enough low-carbon electricity to power . million homes more than the number of households in Scotland.The station employs more than  full-time staff and about  full-time contract partners to ensure the safe reliable generation of electricity."},{"url":null,"title":"ferret-jumped-car-tranent-cemetery-reunited-owner","story":"The Scottish SPCA had appealed for the owner to come forward after the animal was found in Tranent Cemetery on April  and jumped into ldquoan unsuspecting member of the publicrsquos car.A spokeswoman for the charity confirmed that the light-coloured ferret, which was taken to the Scottish SPCArsquos Edinburgh centre, had now been reunited with his owner."},{"url":null,"title":"wedding-in-the-woods-photo-taken-near-tyninghame-picked-one-worlds-best-top-competition","story":"Amanda Farnese Heath was highly commended in the Champagne Taittinger Wedding Food Photographer category at the Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year awards with Wild Wedding For Two.The picture was shot in woods near Tyninghame and Amanda was delighted with the success.She said: ldquoIt was taken during the summer of the first lockdown, around about July.ldquoIt was basically, with the permission of the Forestry Commission, taken deep in the forest near Tyninghame.ldquoIt was a place that we went and found because of the light and everything  that was good for a photograph.Amanda, who lives near Seaclf, has been a photographer for nearly  years and also devotes her time to The Mad March Hare, which offers a dining experience with a dference.The business offers people the chance to enjoy dinner in a number of unusual places, such as deep in the woodland.The photographer, who has previously worked as a stylist with companies including Dobbies Garden Centres and Edinburgh Preserves, said: ldquoI came up with the idea of offering anyone wishing to get married during lockdown a wild tiny wedding with an exquisite banquet in a remote secret location in Scotland.ldquoThis is one of the images from our first minuscule event.The picture was set so that the bride, a model from Glasgow, would be wandering through the forest before coming across the table.Amanda, , spoke to the Courier while she was in the Highlands ldquoon a recce as she prepares her photograph for next yearrsquos awards.The winners of this yearrsquos awards were announced by Fred Sirieix, of First Dates, in an awards ceremony that was live streamed on the competitionrsquos YouTube channel at the end of last month, with people tuning in from across the globe.ldquoOn the competitionrsquos th anniversary, it is wonderful that a record number of entries were received, said Phil Turnbull, CEO of APAL, owner of Pink Lady, and headline sponsor of the awards since .ldquoAlmost , entries were submitted from over  countries around the world.ldquoAs the reach of the competition grows further, it continues to be a truly global inspiration and celebration of the art of food photography.This yearrsquos global judging , chaired by legendary food photographer David Loftus, included Fiona Shields, head of photography,News  Media Nik Sharma, cookbook author and photographer chef Simone Zanoni, Restaurant Le George, Four Seasons Paris Alison Jacques, founder of Alison Jacques Gallery and Vitalie Taittinger, president of Champagne Taittinger."},{"url":null,"title":"saltoun-primary-school-pupils-represent-east-lothian-euroquiz-final","story":"A team of P and P pupils from Saltoun Primary School came first in the Euroquiz heat and will now represent the county on June .Euroquiz is a yearly competition run by SEETfor P pupils from all over Scotland.It aims to widen the childrenrsquos knowledge of European geography, history, culture and languages.A spokeswoman for the primary school said: ldquoSaltoun Primary is a very small school with two multicomposite classes.

that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to

halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to

Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints.

Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

It didnrsquot even rain. Alba failed to register even % in the election ndash yet because of defections it has representatives in the House of Commons and Scottish councils.The two MPs are Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey. The case around Hanvey is a little more complicated than MacAskill, whorsquos a straightforward defector from the SNP to Alba.In , Hanvey was the SNPrsquos candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. He was dropped in November over using anti-semitic language on social media. Despite his suspension, Hanvey appeared on the ballot next to the SNP name as the deadline for candidates to be nominated had passed.After election, he initially sat as an independent. He apologised for anti-semitic language and was readmitted to the SNP. In , he was appointed the SNPrsquos spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee. This March, Hanvey, together with Kenny MacAskill who was elected as the SNP MP for East Lothian, and a number of SNP councillors, defected to Alba. NEIL MACKAY: The Alba effectClearly, voters represented by Hanvey, MacAskill and others ndash such as the Inverclyde councillor Christopher McEleny ndash didnrsquot vote for them as members of Alba. So surely, the only honourable course of action is for these defectors to stand down immediately and submit themselves to by-elections. If the people they currently represent still find them suitable as representatives, then all well and good. However, to cling on to position, power and a public pay cheque in the current circumstances is surely morally untenable, even cowardly.This week Neale Hanvey denounced the SNP as toxic, aggressive and hostile, saying he ldquodetested what the party had become. It would evidently be best policy, perhaps, for all concernedhe makes a clear and irrevocable split with the SNP, putting himself up for re-election on an Alba ticket so he cannot be accused of riding into a job on the coattails of a party he evidently loathes.On a wider stage, matters are currently going very badly for prominent Alba supporters. Craig Murray, a former British diplomat who became a blogger and cheerleader for Alex Salmond, was sentenced to eight months in prison this week for contempt of court relating to the trial of the former First Minister. Judges ruled Murray in contempt relating to material capable of identying four complainers in the case.The future looks shaky too for the nationalist marching organisation All Under One Banner. One of its key figures, Neil MacKay , made great play on social media of showing support for the Alba Party, attracting ridicule and rage from mainstream Yes voters. Some people who previously took part in the rallies have sworn never to attend again, seeing the organisation tainted by Alba support.Itrsquos also a rather embarrassing time for whatrsquos been termed the lsquoalt-nat blogospherersquo which rallied to Salmondrsquos party. Their role was seen as a major turn-off factor when it came to Alba, with ordinary voters repelled by a toxic mix of conspiracy theories, hate and bigotry.Therersquos speculation that Salmond could have done somewhat better at the polls ndash despite his own low approval ratings ndashhersquod wisely kept clear of such characters.Kenny MacAskillThese online voices are really left with nowhere to go now, but further down the rabbit holes theyrsquove been digging for themselves and their diminishing bands of followers for years. They imagined Nicola Sturgeon ousted from office in the wake of the Salmond inquiries and Alba holding seats in Holyrood. Theyrsquove been repeatedly proved wrong.The more tricky question regarding the aftermath of Alba is what Sturgeon should do about those thorns in her side, and the side of the SNP, who many suspected of planning to jump ship to Alba, but when the crunch came seemingly lacked the courage to defect.Although it was all rumour and zero proof, there was intense speculation MPs Angus MacNeil and Joanna Cherry would defect. Both dismissed the idea.However, previous interventions by Cherry and MacNeil have made le dficult for the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. Both are seen as having undermined Sturgeonrsquos leadership, and ndash whether they like it or not ndash perceived as central to the long-running civil war within the ranks of the SNP which caused considerable damage to the party.Whatrsquos clear now, though, is that with the defeat of Alba and its rejection by the electorate, Sturgeon is in a strong position to crack down on any dissent in the ranks. It might well become a rather tough season for the SNPrsquos erstwhile awkward squad.There were recent reports that Alex Salmond claimed he could have lsquodestroyedrsquo Nicola Sturgeon. The only thing which has been destroyed is Albarsquos hopes of gaining any traction with the Scottish people. Salmond, however, insists that his party will ldquobloom. The former First Minister is entitled to think what he wishes, but his hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled. NEIL MACKAY: Salmonds Trumpian circusSalmond is on much firmer ground with his recent warning that ldquoonline warriors are a problem in modern politics. Hersquos undoubtedly correct. So it was a little discomfiting to see him in a online discussion say ndash in jest, it appeared ndash that ldquoone day Irsquom going to unleash myself on Twitter now that Donald Trump has created a vacuum for me.Salmond still casts a long shadow. The husband of one of the women in the Salmond case recently said that the former First Ministerrsquosto the political spotlight had left his we ldquoincapacitated by depression. We must remember Salmond was cleared of all charges.Salmond could change a lothe took just a few simple steps. Apologise for his past behaviour as Nicola Sturgeon has advised him to do, and distance himself from the coterie of extremist voices which surround him. He could also advise the defectors from the SNP to Alba to show the courage of their convictions and face by-election.

Together with the Greens, there is a nationalist majority, as there has been since . The Tories remain the second force in Scottish politics, a long way ahead of theLabour party.The verdict of the Scottish people could not have been clearer. We are a ided country, split more or less evenly between nationalists and unionists. To remain so ided appears, for the time being at least, to be our collective settled will.And yet. The clamour for a repeat referendum on independence started before even all the votes were counted, and the noise will only intensy as the weeks unfold. The UK Government is not interested and, instead of talking about mandates and independence and section  orders and all, is trying none too subtly to remain focused on building our recovery from the pandemic and the havoc it has wreaked.:How the Tories became unlikely working class heroes, by Stuart WaitonThis is smart politics. They would be as foolish indefinitely to rule out any repeat referendum as the SNP would be to rush into it. Politicians who say there cannot be another shot at independence for half a century are as likely to be punished by the voters as politicians who say it must all happen by the end of the autumn. What Scots want, as focus group after focus group has shown, is the prospect of a second referendum on the horizon ndash but no closer than that, thank you very much. Even the most enthusiastic Yes voters understand that we have to recover from Covid first.But, evennow is not the time, it does not follow that all the UK Government should do is to sit back and hope that the clock does not tick too fast.There are those who counsel that unionists should just stop talking about it. Let the SNP talk about itthey want to ndash its their project, after all. We unionists, on the other hand, should get on with fixing the backlog in the NHS, with addressing the year of lost schooling, and with the rising tide of unemployment that, one fears, has been delayed rather than reversed by the Treasuryrsquos highly successful furlough scheme.I hear the force of that argument, but I take a dferent view. I think governments can do more than one thing at a time. Our focus should be on the recovery but, at the same time, we do need to start having a more serious conversation about independence than we have had until now. Again, this is what focus groups will tell you.WestminsterA lot of Scots are indy-curious. Itrsquos an interesting and potentially attractive idea, but they want to know much more about it. Their instinct tells them that it will come with costs ndash and their experience of Brexit tells them their instinct is right. Leaving the United Kingdommay or may not be worth it, they think, but we need to know more before we can decide.Indeed, we need to know more before we can be fairly asked to decide.It is true that the UKrsquos union of four home nations is held together by consent. If one part of the UK wishes to withdraw, it has been our constitutional understanding that the other parts will not stand in the way. We are not Spain, held together by force of law. But the consent that holds us together needs to be informed consent. And we know that there are certain key, critical issues that will have to be addressed before we can really understand what we are being asked by the question ldquoshould Scotland be an independent country Top of the list, now as ever, is currency. What would be the currency of an independent Scotland, and how would it work  An old question, but one to which we still donrsquot know the answer.Every bit as pressing is EU accession. We know what the process would be ndash that is set out in the EU treaties. But what would the price be  How would an independent Scotland reshape its economy such that it complied with the Maastricht convergence criteria  There is no question that Scotland could transition to become a Member State ndash of course we could. But, equally, there is no question that it would be a mighty dficult and expensive process. All this needs to be set out and explained, not after any repeat referendum on independence, but before.And then there is the border ndash not just the land border with England but the sea border with Northern Ireland. With Scotland in the EU and theUK out, what consequences for trade, for freedom of movement, for the unhindered supply of services that we all take completely for granted  Brexit may have made the case for independence stronger, to some minds at least, but it has also made the reality of independence far more complex.:Independence must be about changing lives...not flags. So lets hear the visionNow is the time for these questions to come to the fore. The UK Government should start asking them. Ministers should perhaps even commission some trusted independent experts to think about answering them ndash the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example  Select committees could open inquiries into these matters, perhaps even joint committees of MPs and MSPs combined  You know, we could even have a citizensrsquo assembly on these topics.It matters less what the process is. It matters more that,Scots are to be asked the independence question again, whether during the course of this parliamentary session or not, we have answers we can trust on the core issues that will be facing us.

It will also mean that for many operators, especially those with no outdoor areas to take up the slack, therersquos no point in opening as they wonrsquot be viable.Its a ludicrous situation made all the more preposterous when you think that the same number of people from the same number of households can meet at a palrsquos house for a proper sesh, a house partyyou like, before going out, and after bells, without having to mask up, sanitise and physically distance.Then there is the strict .pm curfew which, along with the two-hour booking window, has enraged operators. Michelin-starred chef Tom Kitchin says herding people out the door at exactly .pm on the dot, when they would normally still be eating, is yet another blow to the struggling restaurant trade.In support of Kitchin, Dean of Faculty of Advocates Roddy Dunlop QC tweeted: ldquoWhat is the basis for saying the same people canrsquot be with you in a hospitality venue with table service at pm \"As for the two-hour booking slots, many in the trade also believe that this will only encourage binge drinking and pub crawls, so not exactly a positive government measure when it comes to reducing the harm associated with alcohol.If you think all of that is crackers, then pour yourself a large one, because the tourism and hospitality guidance surrounding weddings and funerals defies all known logic and reason.For a family wedding, you can leave the house and arrive at the ceremony together but once inside physical distancing rules apply so in effect you cannot walk your daughter down the aisle. You can celebrate, hug, kiss, sing, dance and be merry in your house but not with your  guests at the actual reception, that is taboo and strict physical distancing rules apply. Same with funerals and wakes, you may be together in the cortege, but at the service you must stand apart and again no hugging or cuddling here or at the wake. I wonderbawling your eyes out is also a criminal offence Finally, unlike England, there is still as yet no lting of the two-metre physical distancing rule for theatres, concert halls, comedy and live music venues.

It looks like the UK announcement means whatever is set up will take a four-nations approach, or at least there will be consultation across governments to see how viable that is.This announcement is welcome but overdue, as groups including the Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice group have been calling for an inquiry since last July.Public inquiries take time to set up and then to gather evidence and report. This process is likely to take years rather than months. Findings will help longer term planning but will not change much,anything, soon.:Covid Glasgow: Spike in the city needs a robust response, says Prof Linda BauldIn the meantime we are beginning to see other review mechanisms be established internationally that are already aiming to learn lessons from recent months. Their findings should help us here in Scotland to try and chart a steady course in the short term and also point to issues that need examined in our own inquiries.The first formal review of the global response to Covid- was published this week. This was a report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response . It was convened in September  and made up of  members from dferent countries, co-chaired by Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia. The  reviewed a range of evidence and spoke to many experts and dferent groups. They reflected on the fact that the pandemic has been the worst health, social and economic crisis in living memory, with  million people infected and over three million deaths up to the end of April , although this is likely an underestimate.What the IPPPR report makes clear is that the pandemic was preventable, and argues that there hasnrsquot been sufficient learning from previous infectious disease epidemics like Ebola and SARS. While experts have mapped out how to plan for, prevent, or at least mitigate the impact of these crises, their recommendations have not been taken seriously enough.The report has a strong focus on the global level but also makes recommendations for countries, how they can contribute internationally, and what they need to do within their own borders. This has implications for Scotland and indeed how any enquiry is conducted here or at UK level.The report is an example of the benefits of conducting an inquiry early, because some of its recommendations need to be implemented now to accelerate recovery and prevent more deaths globally. It also includes longer term recommendations. Immediate priorities are around vaccines.The report recommends that high income countries like the UK that have already secured enough vaccines to protect their own populations should, while still delivering jags into arms domestically, provide low and middle income countries with at least one billion vaccine doses by the autumn of this year, with more to follow in .The mechanism for this is Covax, the Covid- vaccines global access facility which the UK joined in September last year. They also recommend waiving intellectual property rights on vaccinesto allow more countries to manufacture vaccines themselves.:Westminster sketch: Boris Johnson calms down about Scotland and promises Duchy courage from GoveLooking ahead, IPPPR also sets out what needs to change in global health governance. They call for more funding for the World Health Organisation from inidual countries, rather than forcing the WHO to rely on big philanthropic organisations. Plus they ask the United Nations to set up a global threats council to coordinate international and national pandemic preparedness, and call for a new international pandemic financing facility.The  praises some countries for their response to Covid- and roundly criticises others, without naming names. Some countries suffered from poor leadership and slow and insufficient action, downplayed risks and didnrsquot take sufficient account of evidence on whatto do.Looking ahead, they point to some key lessons. The first is the need for strong leadership and coordination ndash a lsquowhole of governmentrsquo response to continue to address Covid-. Investing in preparation now for future crises with access to rapid and accurate data and knowing who is accountable for which actions. Having national plans in place for supplies , diagnostics, medicines and vaccines. Plus, setting aside funds for preparation that can be quickly accessed to deal with outbreaks or future threats. These issues will undoubtedly come up in an inquiry into the pandemic here in Scotland and across the UK.There is a final point from this report that is worth emphasising. It isnrsquot enough for international or national authorities to simply instruct people how to behave when a crisis hits. Itrsquos much more effectivepeople can get involved, be listened to and feel they have a stake in a collective response.As we look ahead to a public inquiry on Covid-, the most important voices will be those of the people of Scotland. Not just the families who have lost loved ones but also those working on the front line, and those affected by the measures taken to address the pandemic. It is their experiences that can help us learn lessons and prevent this from happening again.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of EdinburghOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Good judgment and circumstance can mean that they survive for many years but, usually, the longer the same party stays in power, the harder things get.Events happen and problems multiply, which, like chained balls, progressively weigh the incumbents down. Familiarity begins to breed contempt with disgruntled voters while political enemies increase, particularly on the governing partyrsquos benches and especially among those colleagues sacked or overlooked. Divisions deepen and voters realise the once all-conquering heroes have become tired, out-dated failures and so turf them out.The other side of the equation involves an Opposition, heavily defeated and lost for direction.Read more:Will Boris announce Indyref It can be in the political wilderness for years, changing leaders as it struggles to find a core message that resonates with voters.Riven by factions, the would-be government canrsquot seem to understand what the public wants and lurches from defeat to defeat. Then, after yet another humiliating loss, it peers nervously over the abyss and, seeing what oblivion looks like, sharply steps back and begins the slow and painful process of reinvention.It admits its failures, begins to listen again to the public. Hungry for ideas, it talks to focus groups, calls in all manner of experts, think-tanks and voluntary organisations. Gradually, the Dr Who-like transmogrication occurs.A new party with a fresh outlook emerges. Brimming with ideas, enthusiasm and energy, it puts itself forward and the public like what they see. The cycle of democracy repeats itself over again.It is often in defeat that the seeds of victory are sown and, indeed, vice versa.In February , less than two years after Tony Blairrsquos second landslide victory, an embattled Iain Duncan Smith appealed to his ided party to ldquounite or die. He urged the Tories to change or face annihilation. They did change they changed him.His successor, Michael Howard, failed to make a breakthrough in the  election but saw Mr Blairrsquos majority fall sharply, by  to , and the Tories, three-time losers, reached out for change and found the fresh-faced, relatively unknown liberal Conservative David Cameron.Meanwhile in Downing Street, an impatient Gordon Brown finally prised out Mr Blair, got the job he felt he should have had in  but lost the election in .As Mr Cameron and countless party leaders have found reinvention is a tortuous but essential process of democratic politics it is now what Sir Keir and his colleagues have to undertakethey are to stand any chance of taking power at Westminster in   and prevent a fth Conservative government.Following last weekrsquos Super Thursday elections, when Labour made some gains, most notably in the English mayoral contests, but more prominently lost the Hartlepool by-election and hundreds of council seats to the Tories, the party leader compounded the overall poor performance by first ldquoscapegoating Angela Rayner and then over-compensating for his failure to sack his deputy by showering her with an abundance of new positions from shadow first secretary of state, and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to shadow secretary of state for the future of work. It looked like what it was: Sir Keir acting out of weakness.The episode enabled the normally beleaguered Boris Johnson to make hay at the Labour knightrsquos expense.Read more:Sir Keir Starmer now faces a major rethink and resetNoting how the most dangerous beast in the pack was the lioness not the lion, he told Sir Keir: ldquoThe more titles he feeds her, the hungrier I fear she is likely to become.Following what she euphemistically labelled ldquorobust conversations with the party leader, Ms Rayner, a Manchester MP tasked with rekindling Labourrsquos relationship with northern England, admitted voters said ldquothey didnrsquot know what Keir Starmer stood for, so thatrsquos what our challenge is. Quite an admission. Quite an indictment.Helpfully, on cue, the Corbynite old guard appeared and trashed the party leader for abandoning their approach, which  months ago led to Labourrsquos worst defeat since .John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said Labour faced a struggle for its ldquosoul and future, and, clearly fearing a move towards the centre, urged supporters to join a campaign to ensure it remained a ldquosocialist party, that would win the next election on a socialist manesto.Time is not on Labourrsquos side, however. It does not have the luxury of spending months indulging in ision and recrimination. It cannot afford to engage in old Left-Right battles of the past that crippled the party during the s.Mr Blair, who unlike Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to not one but three consecutive General Election victories, said what Labour now needed was ldquototal deconstruction and reconstruction nothing less will do.Interestingly, he noted: ldquoAt present, Labour expresses perfectly the progressive dilemma: Corbyn was radical but not sensible Keir seems sensible but not radical. He lacks a compelling economic message.Borisrsquos ldquojabs and jobs mantra is clearly breaking through with voters south of the Border, most notably in those areas where traditional loyalties to Labour, as in Scotland, have become frayed or broken.Labour needs to find a compelling mission statement based on optimism, community and jobs the only problem is, this is the tune the Tories are singing. Labourrsquos has to sound sweeter.As Britain emerges from the blight of the pandemic and seeks to chart its post-Brexit future, it will need a strong opposition at Westminster, a forceful alternative to hold the incumbent government in Whitehall to account.Itrsquos time for Labour to step up and reinvent itself for the health of our democracy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It began on Monday with a plea from reader Andrew Turnbull for Gaelic to be brought back into public le. He added: ldquoWhy should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names . I decided to illustrate the point with a picture from our files of a bilingual road sign. As fate would have it, I chose Auchinleck, or Achadh nan Leac. And thatrsquos where the trouble began.On Tuesday, Celia Judge retorted that the widespread use of Gaelic was a politically correct gesture, adding that Auchinleck is ldquoa town in the west of Scotland where Gaelic was not spoken and is as foreign a tongue to the locals as Romanian or Chinese. On Wednesday, we had a slew of responses affirming that Gaelic was once widely spoken in the area, with evidence going back as far as the th century. Doug Maughan wrote: ldquoIf we donrsquot use Gaelic and our dialects, they will die out or become museum pieces.There are areas of reporting where we do use the Gaelic. We wouldnrsquot dream of translating Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is now widely used it is becoming almost as familiar as Western Isles Council.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Book your visit to enjoy a wander round the late spring and early summer garden and watch it grow through the seasons to come: https:t.co jNvfWK pic kFRTFdWLlmdash RHS BridgewaterMay , ldquoWe have been looking forward to this day for more than six years, during which time so many people have come together and enabled us to create a stunning new garden that we hope the people of Salford, Greater Manchester, the North West and beyond are proud of.She thanked Salford City Council and landowner the Peel Group which have collaborated on the project, as well as the local community, staff and volunteers who have worked to get it ready.ldquoThis is just the beginning as our garden will give people pleasure for generations to come, but right now I could not be more proud of this incredible group of people, and the monumental achievement of bringing to le our shared vision to create what we believe will become one of the UKrsquos greatest gardens, right in the heart of Greater Manchester, she said.Tom Stannard, Salford City Councilrsquos chief executive, said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic that RHS Garden Bridgewater will soon be open to everyone, creating another world class attraction in Salford and contributing towards tourism and economic growth in Greater Manchester.He said the council played a pivotal role in making the garden a reality, had negotiated an agreement for local residents to visit for free every Tuesday, and would see afor the city of several pounds for every pound invested.Salford City mayor Paul Dennett added: ldquoRHS Garden Bridgewater will be a world-class visitor attraction, bringing a range of important social, environmental, economic benefits and opportunities on a huge scale to the City of Salford and along with other developments such as MediaCityUK, which continues to strengthen Salfordrsquos reputation nationally and internationally as a vibrant city to live, work, visit and play.copy -.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight.

It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

She is commonly described as outgoing, ordinary and sociable by Assembly colleagues.She is certainly the DUP’s most liberal representative on social issues. When asked about same-sex marriage by this newspaper in , she predicted that it would be legalised in the next decade due to “changing attitudes”.She voiced her disapproval of Gregory Campbell’s ‘curry my yoghurt’ mockery of the Irish language in . Neither was she impressed when Sammy Wilson refused to wear a red ribbon in solidarity with those living with HIV AIDS.“I#m a member of the DUP who has worked and formed really good friendships with people of dferent religions and sexual orientations,” she said.“I know those people for who they are and that has given me a broader outlook. I can see how some of the decisions we make affect people. I see faces when I make decisions.” Although she believes in God, she is not a practising Christian.Bradley grew up in Mossley in Newtownabbey. Her mum was a social worker, her dad was a driver, and her brother Daniel is a hairdresser. She had a big extended family and summers were spent in her grandparents’ caravan in Ballyhalbert.She has two adult children, Josh and Jess, with ex-husband Robert Bradley. They were orced at . “It wasn’t amicable and we’re not in touch,” she candidly admitted in a wide ranging Belfastinterview in .“We were too young. I was  when I got married. If one of my children had come home at  and told me they were getting married, I#d have said #No way#.”As a young mother, she got into debt, facing the repossession of her home after she separated from her husband. “He went back to England and I was left with a mortgage and two children. Financially, it was really, really hard,” she said.“They were coming the following day to evict me, then I told my parents. They went to the mortgage company, took out a loan and paid what I owed. The arrears had crept up, but I#d buried my head in the sand. I ignored the problem because I didn#t want to be seen as a failure as a mother.“It was a traumatic period. I had two children, aged seven and five, who needed me and I was the one who was supposed to look after and protect them.”On leaving school, she had worked in a canteen kitchen before joining the RUC as a part-time reserve when she was . Bradley was one of the few women in the force at the time. She says it was “an interesting job, but not the career I wanted.”She secured a communications job in DUP headquarters in . After that, she worked as a social care assistant for the Northern Trust from -, but she remained politically active.She was elected onto Newtownabbey Council in  and became mayor in . Nigel Dodds asked her to run for Stormont in . Her son told her to “wise up” but she talked him round, and she was elected.Bradley told this reporter last year that she had never experienced sexism at Stormont, and that her previous jobs in the police and health service had been much more challenging in that regard.But she said social media abuse was widespread: “You#re called horrendous names. I#m not just a politician, I#m a mummy and a granny.“I#ve been told #You should have been aborted at birth# and #I hope your children die#. My kids read this stuff. When I put out a statement online, I#m fearful of what will come.Yes she said there was a spirit of sisterhood in Stormont: “Women from other parties will ring each other and support each other when something horrible happens.”She has said she is frequently mistaken for Alliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw: “We both receive each other#s mail and emails. I quite like the idea because she#s younger and much slimmer than I am.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsLiving it up in the NI countryside: £.m house of the year perfect for shaking off city leWhich way will they go  DUP MPs and MLAs cast votes for new party leaderIn profile: New DUP deputy leader Paula BradleyTime is running out to save Titanic wreckage, warn expertsTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots is elected DUP leader\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh fbbdaddabfecaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayMass band parade against NI Protocol takes place in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news dc .ece AUTOCROP wh adbefcdfdacacfaef.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayArmy bomb disposal sweep Belfast primary school following telephone bomb warningLatest Northern IrelandStepping out: Edwin Poots takes a statesmanlike stroll to his first Stormont media scrum as leaderSF rescue fund legal challenge may threaten NW recoveryCastleCourt was shining success story but building £m shopping centre became deadly game of cat-and-mouse with IRAEdwin Poots elected DUP leader as he pledges to #fight# the NI Protocol and work together with other unionistsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageLatestFoster set to face pressure to quit her post earlyStepping out: Edwin Poots takes a statesmanlike stroll to his first Stormont media scrum as leaderSF rescue fund legal challenge may threaten NW recoverySuzanne BreenOpinion‘Peasants’ Revolt’ as DUP big beasts defeated  Alex KaneOpinionNew DUP leader Edwin Poots faces the same problems as Foster but needs a dferent approach,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

LeebodyTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe  UEFA Super Cup is to be moved from Belfast to Istanbul, according to reports.The match – featuring the winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League – was set to be played at Windsor Park in south Belfast on August .With Manchester City and Cha both featuring in the Champions League final and Manchester United featuring in the Europa League final – the move will be a blow to those fans in Northern Ireland hoping to see the Premier League sides touch-down in Belfast.It was hoped fans would be able to attend the show piece event, with coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland easing over the coming months.According to the BBC, European football#s governing body has been trying to deal with the fallout from moving this season#s Champions League final to Portugal from Turkey for a second successive year.Hosting next season#s Super Cup fixture on  August is among the compensation measures being offered to the Turkish football authorities, which are also likely to include staging the  Champions League final.It is understood a final decision by UEFA is yet to be made, but is being called “likely”.Patrick Nelson, chief executive of the Irish Football Association, said: We are aware of rumours circulating around this year#s Super Cup, however nothing has been decided by Uefa yet.We are also acutely aware of the problems being faced across Europe due to Covid and we are always ready to play our part as a member of the European football family..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the

The historic parallels between the challenges facing the DUP leader designate and the forefather of unionism, Carson, who campaigned to stop Home Rule, are almost too obvious to draw attention to.And the media and the public will demand answers to them sooner than later.For now, though, Mr Poots can enjoy the buzz around his appointment.As he was ferried off, a family looked on bemused, with a child asking: “Will this be on TV ” The answer was yes.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a day when injury time was a game all of its own. Derrys plight was outside their own hands. News of Down trailing in Cork filtered through to Brewster Park where Carlus McWilliams stoppage time point grabbed victory. But it wasnt enough. Jerome Johnston saved Down with a thminute equaliser. Derrys inferior score dference saw them drop below Clare and Down, to the drop zone, and out of the top half of Irelands football rankings. Of the six teams in Division  that weekend, Dublin, Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone and Monaghan remain there. Since then, Derry have dropped to Division , bounced back and fell victim to a horrendous start last season that keeps them in Irelands bottom half. googletag.cmd.push If eight team leagues arent competitive enough, Derry are stepping into the fire this weekend, in the Covid- induced four-team leagues. In the distance, Fermanagh and Ulster champions Cavan come down the tracks, but Saturdays trip to Longford will tell a lot in a -day period that will define Derrys season. Mention Longford to any Derry fan, and it will generate that sickening feeling in the pit of their stomach. Digging deeper, since the turn of the millennium, the sides have played eight times in league and championship, with Derry winning three of them. Of the five Derry played on their travels, you have to go back to a  All-Ireland series for their only win. It was a day when current Longford manager Padraic Davis kicked six points, as Derry hammered them in just the second year of the qualiers, thanks to two Anthony Tohill goals. googletag.cmd.push More recently Derry tanked them at Celtic Park last year, but they were without experienced trioMichael Quinn, Barry McKeon and David McGivney. Speaking to the County Derry Post last week, Rory Gallagher reported an almost clean bill of health. An impact knee injury, sustained in a clash at training, leaves Conor McCluskey the only one of this -strong squad doubtful. Karl McKaigue, Ruairi Mooney and Jack Doherty, bar the latters McKenna Cup appearance in Gallaghers first game in Inniskeen, missed all of . The trio are in contention for a start this weekend. Gareth McKinless, who starred for Ballinderry in the last two championships, withdrew from the county scene at the start of  with plans to go travelling. After expressing a desire to , he is back in the fold.     In the off-season, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers had knee operations, after years of wear and tear, with Padraig Cassidy going through a rehabilitation programme on a troublesome hip injury. There is a greater consistency to the . Of the  players Rory Gallagher gave inter-county debuts to last year, only Eoghan Duffy and Alex Doherty are no longer on the . Of the current squad, only newcomers Conleth McShane and his Bellaghy teammate Ronan McFaul have yet to make their debut. The championship will take care of itself when it comes around. Before that, its hard to imagine it even being discussed in the group. Getting off to a winning start is the only show in town. Momentum is sports most useful tool. With it, so much of everything  follows. Derry are well-placed. Having almost everyone fit for selection is one plus. The squad are in tip top shape and there has to be positives from elements of the Armagh performance in last years championship. Defensively, there are vast improvements to be made. With McKinless in the mix and with Karl McKaigue ing, it will create more competition and with it, the standards will rise. Thats the first improvement. Those early exchanges left Armagh playing the game on their own terms. Any shot Longford get away this weekend, will need to be under more than token pressure. Longford have only failed to hit the net in six of the  games under Padraic Davis in the last two seasons. Secondly, getting a medium to long-range kick-out option is another thing Derry need to find. Working the ball out short is okay to an extent, but it is energy sapping and doesnt ask enough questions of the opposition. Half the Derry squad come from Glen , Slaughtneiland Magherafelt , teams with their goalkeepers going short more often than not. A more ied Derry at midfield, will give them so many more options up front. This is where many of the gains are to be had, but it plonks responsibility on Emmett Bradley and the untested Conor Glass. Yes, the former minor captain was a professional athlete, but he has been away from the game for the last five years.

It was a day when injury time was a game all of its own. Derrys plight was outside their own hands. News of Down trailing in Cork filtered through to Brewster Park where Carlus McWilliams stoppage time point grabbed victory. But it wasnt enough. Jerome Johnston saved Down with a thminute equaliser. Derrys inferior score dference saw them drop below Clare and Down, to the drop zone, and out of the top half of Irelands football rankings. Of the six teams in Division  that weekend, Dublin, Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone and Monaghan remain there. Since then, Derry have dropped to Division , bounced back and fell victim to a horrendous start last season that keeps them in Irelands bottom half. googletag.cmd.push If eight team leagues arent competitive enough, Derry are stepping into the fire this weekend, in the Covid- induced four-team leagues. In the distance, Fermanagh and Ulster champions Cavan come down the tracks, but Saturdays trip to Longford will tell a lot in a -day period that will define Derrys season. Mention Longford to any Derry fan, and it will generate that sickening feeling in the pit of their stomach. Digging deeper, since the turn of the millennium, the sides have played eight times in league and championship, with Derry winning three of them. Of the five Derry played on their travels, you have to go back to a  All-Ireland series for their only win. It was a day when current Longford manager Padraic Davis kicked six points, as Derry hammered them in just the second year of the qualiers, thanks to two Anthony Tohill goals. googletag.cmd.push More recently Derry tanked them at Celtic Park last year, but they were without experienced trioMichael Quinn, Barry McKeon and David McGivney. Speaking to the County Derry Post last week, Rory Gallagher reported an almost clean bill of health. An impact knee injury, sustained in a clash at training, leaves Conor McCluskey the only one of this -strong squad doubtful. Karl McKaigue, Ruairi Mooney and Jack Doherty, bar the latters McKenna Cup appearance in Gallaghers first game in Inniskeen, missed all of . The trio are in contention for a start this weekend. Gareth McKinless, who starred for Ballinderry in the last two championships, withdrew from the county scene at the start of  with plans to go travelling. After expressing a desire to , he is back in the fold.     In the off-season, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers had knee operations, after years of wear and tear, with Padraig Cassidy going through a rehabilitation programme on a troublesome hip injury. There is a greater consistency to the . Of the  players Rory Gallagher gave inter-county debuts to last year, only Eoghan Duffy and Alex Doherty are no longer on the . Of the current squad, only newcomers Conleth McShane and his Bellaghy teammate Ronan McFaul have yet to make their debut. The championship will take care of itself when it comes around. Before that, its hard to imagine it even being discussed in the group. Getting off to a winning start is the only show in town. Momentum is sports most useful tool. With it, so much of everything  follows. Derry are well-placed. Having almost everyone fit for selection is one plus. The squad are in tip top shape and there has to be positives from elements of the Armagh performance in last years championship. Defensively, there are vast improvements to be made. With McKinless in the mix and with Karl McKaigue ing, it will create more competition and with it, the standards will rise. Thats the first improvement. Those early exchanges left Armagh playing the game on their own terms. Any shot Longford get away this weekend, will need to be under more than token pressure. Longford have only failed to hit the net in six of the  games under Padraic Davis in the last two seasons. Secondly, getting a medium to long-range kick-out option is another thing Derry need to find. Working the ball out short is okay to an extent, but it is energy sapping and doesnt ask enough questions of the opposition. Half the Derry squad come from Glen , Slaughtneiland Magherafelt , teams with their goalkeepers going short more often than not. A more ied Derry at midfield, will give them so many more options up front. This is where many of the gains are to be had, but it plonks responsibility on Emmett Bradley and the untested Conor Glass. Yes, the former minor captain was a professional athlete, but he has been away from the game for the last five years. Thirdly, in attack, Shane McGuigan is the star of the show and getting him a regular wing-man up front is a must. If Derry can improve in these three areas, they can go one better than last season and gain promotion. But it will be far from easy.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With new movie Stealth due to premiere before the end of this month, the company is currently working on Grief, a film detailing the pain and loss caused by the Covid- pandemic. The second instalment of Long Shot, entitled Long Shot’s Letter, is also due for completion. After Grief is shot and edited by mid-June, its on to West Banksy which will deal with drug addiction and abuse. googletag.cmd.push The groups alternative news programme, It’s News To Me, will be launched in September and it is hoped three more short films by the end of the year, one of which will focus on bullying in the secondary sector. Joseph McCarthy, writer, director and producer with Black North, which he founded, said: “We have already sourced school ties and shirts and will need to source jumpers, trousers and skirts too. “In between times, we will complete the third part of our Troubles’ Trilogy, so we will be very busy for some time. We will also be casting for new members when the lockdown lts.” googletag.cmd.push Joseph said Black North Productions was formed to get the message out there that the North of Ireland is not a place to avoid, not a place of hate and despair. He added: “The North of Ireland is a beautul place, populated by friendly people who have been trapped by history that is not of our making. We aim to show the positive aspects of Northern Ireland, that is second to no other place in artistic talent.” Joe explained how Black North came into being. “We came about due to a marked lack of opportunity for people who had artistic ability, but in essence no real outlet. I began writing poetry and plays some years ago and I wrongly assumed that long established arts venues would nurture new talent.     “A good example of this was when I tried to get one of my plays performed in the city. I approached the then chief executive of that venue and spoke with a  of their governing body regarding getting some assistance to have my play produced. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there was an insular attitude and mercenary outlook, which left me both surprised and disappointed. “Needless to say, I have had no contact with either that venue or those art experts since. It’s interesting to note, that the play I approached them with which was called Enough is Enough won the University of Ulster’s Greer Garson Award for Theatre soon after that meeting. I formed the impression that I was being grilled on that occasion and that in itself, was an unpleasant experience. “I came up with idea of forming Black North Productions and at that particular time, the North of Ireland was being avoided by many people from the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The Nordies were cast in a dark light that we simply did not deserve to be in that position. I set out to show that we in the North, and in particular our city, can produce poetry, plays and short films that can be deemed as artistic works of the highest quality. “There was never any formal meeting or expressions of interest highlighted at that time. I came up with idea, developed the idea, enlisted the help of others who were of the same mind-set, both regarding the attitudes of outsiders to the North of Ireland and the dismal lack of assistance that prevailed in the city and unfortunately still does to a large extent.” Black Norths first film was Wish You Were Here. Joe explained its storyline: “It revolved around a writer played by Greta McTeague, who whilst writing a detective novel gets, side-tracked by the historic events that have happened in the city. The film opens in  and in her mind she imagines she is speaking with the people from that time. The central character is the likeable and fair- minded Michael Quinlivan. I intended to produce a Trouble’s Trilogy moving from  to  and then to present day. “The theme was in essence about the Trouble’s children, who lived through that period, suffered so much and yet seamlessly formed bonds with total strangers who shared the same experiences and through those experience formed bonds that still exist today.” To date, Black North has made six films – as well as Wish You Were Here, there has been Right Reasons For Wrong, Long Shot, F-, Unlucky Lucky and andSnowflake Generation. Joseph added: “We will premiere Stealth by the end of the month and have quite a lot of work completed on our final Troubles film, Half Ticket No Return. but due to such a large cast and the urrent restrictions, we have had to put that one onhold.” Joseph said Stealth was a really interesting piece. He added: “It is set in both present day and the future and shows our technical abilities and innovations through an intriguing storyline that will make people sit up and think. It is very much an Orwellian piece with a modern twist.” Black North is currently working on Grief, telling the story of loss due to the pandemic. Joe said it came about for a number of reasons. He added: “Having known so many people who have lost loved ones and listened to their heart-wrenching stories of not getting to say that final goodbye, or to be there when they felt they were most needed, made me feel that there needs to be some kind of closure. A chance to say that final farewell.” Joseph conceded the films topic was dficult topic to deal with it. He said: “As we all know, Covid- has had a devastating effect on so many people and has brought entire countries to a standstill. “It was a dficult topic to deal with in a sensitive and constructive way, I have done my best to alleviate the sense of loss and hurt that this terrible virus has caused. “I really hope that we, as a team, have done that. From our extras, who will play mourners, to the bikers who will escort the coffin into the city, to our choir and central characters played by Jamie Coll, Chantel Carlin, Gabriel White, Kieran Dallas, Corey Hanna and Dean O’Donnell, I really hope we have.” So, how did the bikers become involved  Joseph explained: “Gerry McGeady, a leading light with Centurions MC, is the main man when it came to organising bikers. “Gerry is a well-respected biker of many years and has strong connections to the world of bikers and, in particular, the local clubs. “I have to thank him for all his efforts in bringing together a dedicated bunch of bikers in the form of The Exiles RC and The Centurions MCC. “The bikers are a great team to work with and they are keen to become involved in Grief as they too understand the immense sense of loss felt by so many people.” Joseph said Black Norths was very proud of its wide range of cast members. He said: “The pandemic has made casting for parts very dficult for us, but we have done our best to continue to bring in new members and Grief will comprise of several new member and a younger cast. “Quite often, a member will suggest a family member who would suit a part or a friend or relative and once we give that person a piece to perform and have a chat with him her, we then film them and take it from there. “We are proud of our wide and ied cast members. “We have people from all backgrounds such as: bricklayers, plasterers, council workers, accountants, health care workers, secondary school pupils, students, basically from every walk of le. “Some people were hesitant and lacked confidence, those same people are now much more confident and outgoing. “Indeed, this has been one of greatest achievements to date, to see people develop and grow in confidence, people who would never have had an opportunity to become involved in film.”                                         --  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Government Boundaries Commissioner Sarah Havlin has outlined further details about her review of the  district council boundaries and the proposed timetable and process for public consultation. This includes publishing a short information video to outline the review process and highlighting why and how people can get involved. This also coincides with the start of a series of ‘Meet the Commissioner’ briefing events with council representatives from across all  councils. By the end of July this year, the Commissioner plans to publish provisional proposals, outlining any proposed changes to local government boundaries. googletag.cmd.push The closing date for written submissions about these provisional proposals will be September  this year. After this, a series of public hearings will be held to gather further feedback and these will be subject to the relevant covid- public health guidance at that time. Thereafter, there will be a period of analysis of the representations and public hearing reports, before the preparation of revised proposals which will again be subject to further consultation. The review is something that by law has to happen every eight- years and although the last review took place in   with the final recommendations from that providing the basis for the last review of local government boundaries which after legislation and elections etc, took effect from  when the new councils came into being. googletag.cmd.push The last review, which saw Derry City Council and Strabane District Council combine to make Derry City and Strabane District Council, coincided with the change in local government which saw the signicant change from  to  councils so was more substantial in nature. This review will take into account changes in electoral changes housing changes among other things since  and make recommendation on the boundaries of the  current districts and the ious wards that make them up. It’s hard to know what the initial proposals will show as modelling electoral analysis etc is ongoing but there may well be some local government boundaries changing.     The review will also examine the potential for changes to the names of local wards to reflect local considerations. The review, when completed next year, will then need to be legislated on before any actual boundary changes would take effect. Boundary Commissioner, Sarah Havlin, is encouraging everyone with an interest to get involved in what she described this important review. everyone with an interest to get involved. “We have also published an information video to highlight how and why people should get involved. The outcomes will inform the make-up of local government in the foreseeable future andwill consider the impact of electorate changes since  and other recent developments. “The process is about independently ensuring electoral equality and fairness across Northern Ireland, with the aim that all the wards within a district should, as far as possible, have a similar number of electors. “With that I mind, it’s important that we hear the views of local people and their representatives on these matters, and I would encourage people to regularly check our website and social media channels for more information on how they can have their voice heard in this process.” Review details can be found athttps:www. lgbc-ni.org.uk or via Twitter and Facebook @LGBCNI.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important.

She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy.

Before inter-county football shoehorned the club game into whatever orice it can find, the senior and reserve double header on a Sunday was set in stone across Derry. With cars filtering in the lane from after three oclock, stalwarts would perch themselves along the fence to run their eye over the reserve action. The senior managers ears would often be burning, as some doting Daddies would question their sons non-selection for the seniors. “That man hasnt a clue,” youd sometimes hear. A stellar showing in the reserve game would have you hauled ashore early, to stay fresh for a cameo senior appearance. Some saw it as elevation. The player himself would be frustrated at having his vintage display cut short. googletag.cmd.push Thats the problem with almost being on the senior team. Youre caught between two stools. Everyone  knows where they stand in the pecking order. Johnny must be in the seniors plans,” the auld hands would mumble as he trotted off. He might get five minutes in the senior game. He might get . He might get none. It just depended on how things were going. Thats how it was. If another player on the reserve team, lets call him Paddy, kicked the last two scores, made a goal line block or emptied some man out over the sideline, hed dine off legendary status. googletag.cmd.push “Youd some game Paddy,” somebody would tell him, over the wire, as he pulled on a senior sub jersey. “Youd be starting in the seniors every weekI was over that team.” By the time Paddy pulls up a stool at the bar later that night, and puts manners in his first pint, his bone crunching shoulder challenge has now exaggerated ten times over. “He put yer man through the wire,” would be the latest. And nobody is going to dampen a good story. That was Sunday every week in the club leagues. Tuesday night at training was the time to put in your shout for the senior team next week. And so the cycle continued.     The alternative is playing the reserve game afterwards, with anyone not getting a decentof time in the senior game will get their fill of football. But the self esteem must take an awful battering as almost everyone leaves after the senior game. It depends what your take is. As much as that model served the GAA well, it has its downfall. With the level of preparation at club level going through the roof, the whole weeks diet, rest and social le revolves around the Sunday. Social media went into meltdown last week, with everyone salivating over their Friday night slot for senior games, like Downs tried and tested formula. In theory, it is a great idea. Friday night pints. Saturday and Sunday to take your better half or family out for the day Training on a Monday and Wednesday night, ready to go again. There are two drawbacks. At the height of the Celtic Tiger, with players working in Dublin or further afield, it was a squeeze to get home for a training session at eight oclock, never mind racing home for six oclock to play a reserve game as part of a double header. Secondly, splitting the reserve and senior games to dferent days leaves twice the amount of travel, for the fringe senior players who will be on both squads, while leaving you back where you started with a reserve game on the Sunday. For me, Saturday six oclock and half seven is the answer. It is somewhere in between. It leaves Saturday night free for players to do as they please and get themselves in order for training the following week. The only people it will affect are those who are mixing their GAA with the local soccer or rugby team. But, maybe this is where a compromise needs to be reached. In some places, soccer and rugby keep players fitness ticking over during the off-season. And vice versa. Rather than going loggerheads, clubs could select a certain number of their games for Sunday until the soccer and rugby seasons are over, before moving to Saturday. It wouldnt be every club. In a way, it also gives local GAA clubs an advantage. How many times have you wanted to go and watch the crunch game of the weekend, but cant because you have a game of your own. I always use the example of going to watch Lavey and Ballinderry in a late Sunday evening game. The rest of Derry had the chance to call in on their way home. There was a bumper crowd and an electric atmosphere for players. Everybody is a winner. So of the  games in the Derry A and B leagues, have half on a Sunday, half on a Saturday and one on a Friday night. Set the dates in stone, which gives players six free Sundays they wouldnt normally have had. There is the option of taking your kids to the pool, book a weekend away, nurse a hangover or watch a county game. The licence to do any of those things will make GAA less of a strain on the weekend. The Sunday fixture does suit the supporter, but they arent obliged to go to a game every weekend andthey do, itll take up three hours at the most. Players are dferent. Theyll dedicate Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, with all the sacrices they make in between. Their voice should be heard above the rest. Imagine the weekend Paddy would have, living off kicking three points to win the reserve game and pummelling the oppositions hatchet man in the process.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing. As a teacher myself I think its great to have such books for children showing ersity.Cara inspired a new fashion range earlier this year for girls and teens born with the same condition as her.She hopes to be a spokesperson and campaigner for people with dwarfism in the future.The Irish Roots Festival, created by Tipperary native Lorraine Maher, finishes today.Speaking about the festival, she said: ldquoMixed-race people are one of the fastest growing demographics in the western world, it is crucial to highlight the lives, achievements and struggles of mixed-race Irish people.ldquoThis is a great opportunity to give a shout out globally to those of Irish ancestry regardless of colour or location, she said. ldquoRepresentation is so important for a sense of well-being and belonging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Developers.jpg","title":"Developers invited to enter bids for redevelopment site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will be asked within the next few weeks to submit their respective bids for the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police base in Downpatrick.The news was confirmed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee on Monday evening.Stretching back as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, the proposed development site includes the Irish Street car park and a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base.It is understood that five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand the local authorityThe development brief paves the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site and developers will be given up to  weeks to submit their respective proposals with a final assessment then made to select the preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, the company will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Councillors were due to discuss a motion at Monday nightrsquos meeting which urged the council to acquire land to create a road access through the development site on to St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of the redevelopment proposal and also upgrade and integrate three adjoining privately owned car parks into the proposal.Debate on the motion was adjourned, but in papers submitted prior to the committee meeting senior council staff made it clear that any change would result in the suspension of the development brief and changes to the projectrsquos business case.The local authority has been working on the Irish Street project in partnership with the DfC for some time and when the police base became available for sale, the local authority commissioned a feasibility study exploring options around how the site could be developed in tandem with the Irish Street car park.The study concluded that a so-called mixed use development of the sprawling site would be the most suitable option with the government department subsequently acquiring the land, with the local authority purchasing a strip of land between the Irish Street car park and the former police base.A project board was then set up comprising Downpatrick area councillors and a number of local stakeholders including business community representatives which sought the views of developers and the local community around the sitersquos potential uses and constraints.It was confirmed on Monday night that based on the feedback the development brief was worked up and will go to market in the coming weeks. Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run. This fired up Eoin Moag to produce another fine over and clean bowl A Lawther.Ards were now well on the back foot at  for . Captain Reilly took another wicket in the following over before handing the reins to Keba Butler, who promptly took a wicket with his fourth ball.Newcomer Matthew Douglas was introduced into the attack to replace Moag and was soon also among the wickets with only his fourth delivery for the club.This was followed up by Kristofer McNeill coming from behind the stumps to bowl mdash his two overs going for  runs, but also gaining wicket.With Dundrum now firmly in the driving seat, the bowling was passed around with youngsters Andrew Campbell and James Wright bowling well.Experienced clubmen Andrew Hammond and James Orr came on with James taking his first wicket of the season and Ardsrsquo last batsman to give Dundrum victory by  runs.A massive result for the club made possible by a dedicated ground staff, driven committee and some excellent work with young people in the surrounding area which has enabled the thirds to field five U- players, all of whom will be vying for a spot next week and maybe even the seconds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 16%2C 2001  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash The project to transfer one of Ballynahinchrsquos most prestigious buildings was officially launched last week.The historic Market House in Ballynahinch is to get a new lease of le and over the coming months will be transformed into a new civic building during a near poundm redevelopment project.The scheme will complete the Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committeersquos plans to transform the heart of the town and complement the redeveloped square.Local planning chiefs are expected to give the scheme the green light within the next few weeks and preliminary work to strip plaster from the building has revealed ornate stone work and archways which are to be incorporated in the design of the new civic facility.The chairman of the Regeneration Committee, Mr Vincent Fullam, said the public launch of the Market House project marks the end of a long crusade which involved numerous meetings.KILLYLEAGH ndash The future of a multi-million pound marina and housing project for Killyleagh is expected to be known next month.Local planning officials are expected to announcethey are prepared to allow the controversial scheme planned for the Gocean area in the town when they meet local politicians.Speculation is mounting the poundm plan will be refused, but planners have confirmed they have still not reached a final decision on the issue, explaining they are still heavily involved in discussions with a number of organisations.They say it would be wrong to draw any conclusion at this stage as the consultation process is far from complete.It had been widely predicted a public inquiry would be ordered into the project but after its detail was scrutinised by senior planners in Belfast, they passed it back to planners based at Rathkeltair House in Downpatrick and told them there would be no public scrutiny of the scheme.DUNDRUM mdash A call has been made for a review of planning in Dundrum before the beauty of the village is ldquolost forever.The request has been made by SDLP candidate, Mr Charlie McGrath, who says the pace of new housing developments in the area raises a number of issues which need to be addressed.Mr McGrath, a candidate in the Newcastle area, has said it will be too late for locals to complain about the shape of the area after the developers and planners had finished with the village. He has called for a debate into the problem ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Mr McGrath, who is also concerned about the lack of facilities for local residents, said he has written to the local banks about providing cash points and is ldquovery encouraged by the response. He is also pleased that replacement pubic toilets are again to be provided in the village.He said that with the influx of young families in the area there is a ldquoglaring need for youths facilities such as playgrounds and has commended the work of the Dundrum Forum for Play in raising the profile of what he called an ldquounderestimated need.DOWNPATRICK mdash The Great Hall at the Downshire

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffabdbcad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbffeeacbbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
