About a third of its cars were delivered to customers in North America, followed by China, which accounted for about a quarter.“We are not really in the car business – we are in the luxury goods business,” he told the BBC. “All our clients have multiple cars in their garages. It is more that you look for something that’s very special. We are famous for bespoke so you can basically customise a Rolls-Royce to build your own masterpiece and I think that has attracted quite a lot of clients worldwide.”Müller-Otvös said the number of cars designed to customers’ specifications hit a new high in 2019.“The Bespoke collective at the home of Rolls-Royce in Goodwood, West Sussex, comprises several hundred creative designers, engineers and craftspeople,” the company said. “These highly talented men and women take enormous pride in fulfilling unprecedented levels of customer requests for bespoke personalisation and delivering on beautiful inidual commissions such as the Rose Phantom.”The Rose Phantom was requested by Swedish billionaire Ayad al-Saffar, who asked Rolls-Royce to fill the interior with roses. More than 1m embroidered satin stitches were needed to create a fantasy rose garden interior with an entanglement of greenery, flowers, and butterflies.The Phantom Rose used in the design was created for Rolls-Royce by the British rose breeder Philip Harkness, and can only be found in the rose garden at the company’s headquarters in Goodwood. Al-Saffar said he decided on the design while chatting to Rolls-Royce’s designers in the rose garden.Rolls-Royce’s bespoke designer, Ieuan Hatherall, said: “The patron wanted to create that same feeling of awe an abundance of flowers to lift the spirit and celebrate nature’s decadent beauty, in the Rose Phantom’s serene interior.”On the future after Brexit, Müller-Otvös said: “What needs to be delivered are proper, long-lasting trade deals not only with the European Union but also with the entire rest of the world,” he said. “Free flow of goods and people, that is very important for us.”He said Rolls-Royce was committed to remaining in the UK.

Except that it is no such thing. It is the Australian Labor party’s internal review after its shock general election defeat last May. It is an honest assessment, available to all, of why and how democratic leftwing parties lose elections. Given what unfolded in the UK election, it is unlikely that anyone close to the Labour leadership had read it. Or if they had, they ignored its central findings.Jeremy Corbyn has promised to stay on as party leader to allow a “period of reflection”. He is right that reflection is needed, but so is a review of how Labour lost, why it lost, and how to ensure those mistakes are never repeated. The former leader Ed Miliband has now joined a group of MPs and other party members to carry this out.This review desperately needs to consider what the future holds for progressive politics in Boris Johnson’s Britain. However, it cannot be rushed through before a spring leadership election.The Australian Labor review took five months. This was done in the context of a parliament with three-year terms and an election that everyone expected Labor to win, which ultimately left the party eight seats short of a majority government. In contrast, Britain has five-year terms, Labour lost hugely, and at no stage did the polls predict that Corbyn would be elected.Only three Labour leaders since 1945 have won elections: Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair. All three were highly able political leaders, but all only won their first election after long periods of Conservative rule. That is a stark lesson for Labour. Not only must you have a highly competent leader, you also need years of Conservative misrule for the public to take a chance on you.Labour might not win an election until 2025. That would be 20 years since Blair’s third election victory. None of the subsequent Labour leaders have come close. If they are not in with a reasonable prospect of winning in 2025, Labour’s very survival will be in question, for what is the point of a political party that cannot win elections?Labour’s review cannot be a partisan one, controlled by one particular faction at the expense of another. It has to be transparent and brutal in its honesty about mistakes. Factionalism can have no place. The review must also have the gravitas to direct Labour away from repeating its electoral failings.The Australian Labor party’s approach – forming a review body of six respected party figures, including political grandees – is, of course, one way it could be done. However, the British party’s problems could quickly become existential if it refuses to engage effectively with the recent past.That is why its review needs not only its political, trade union and community figures, but also a well-respected legal presence, such as a retired high court judge or a senior lawyer. This is the best way of ensuring the review has the skills necessary to gather evidence, record and categorise it. That legal presence needs to be independent of the past and current Labour leadership. Failure to source this legal skill set risks the review becoming a broad exchange of political perspectives that lacks a detailed analysis.Of course, a review is just the start. Many may ask what the point is of a review, given that those in control of the Labour movement may choose to ignore it. However, even if that dispiriting prospect should prove true, a high-quality, transparent review would still give an analytical guide to those progressive voices that are fed up with losing over and over again.The Labour party deserves better than post-election polemics, and so do those working-class voters who felt they had no choice but to vote Conservative.The Australian Labor party has many more years left in it. Does the British Labour party care enough about winning to safeguard its future? How it engages with a review will go a long way to answering that question.• Ed Williams QC is a barrister at Cloisters chambers, and a former prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8ef52dfab97229c5c2bfd623f5ed543fb88356/269_317_2060_1236/master/2060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb222c5454d417120425fa9ab2203f","title":"next phase brexit messy","story":"With the clock ticking, a low-alignment deal with the EU now seems likely, but it comes with great risksBoris Johnson’s honeymoon was always going to be short-lived. The immediate, unexpected, reason is the sudden escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. But it won’t be long before Brexit once again dominates the headlines.With the UK set to leave the EU on 31 January, and both sides set to embark on trade negotiations shortly thereafter, the prime minister, his senior ministers and his key aides are keen to lower the temperature. “We want to see Brexit on the business pages, not the front pages,” says one ally.Two key factors will determine whether this aim is achieved. First, will Johnson stick to his decision ruling out any extension to the transition period, in effect imposing a 31 December deadline for concluding a free trade deal with the EU? Second, will he make good on his desire to “erge” from EU rules and standards, thereby prioritising the government’s right to do things differently over preferential access to the single market?The initial signals aren’t promising for industry. Johnson will politely dismiss EU warnings that his timetable is unrealistic when he meets the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street on Wednesday. Although he now commands an 80-strong parliamentary majority, extending the transition, and thereby remaining in the single market and customs union with no say over their rules while handing over wads more cash, would seriously anger Eurosceptic MPs and some voters. Senior ministers also believe that the very tight deadline will concentrate minds in Brussels. “We will not extend the transition under any circumstances,” one Downing Street source told me.This will leave seven months to hammer out a deal. The EU’s 27 member states will only agree on the commission’s mandate to negotiate on their behalf by the end of February. The cabinet and Whitehall will also need time to settle on a final policy. Ratification of the deal will probably take two to three months. In a best-case scenario, that leaves March to September – about seven negotiating cycles – to strike an agreement. It’s an understatement to suggest this might not be long enough.The prime minister hopes the arrival of Von der Leyen in place of Jean-Claude Juncker will mark a new start, as the two “friends and partners” agree a new relationship. He will also work hard to build personal rapport with EU leaders. Just as bonding with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, unblocked the withdrawal agreement talks, he will hope that strong relationships with other EU capitals could smooth the trade talks, too. But even if things are more cordial than during the orce – and that is a big “if” – the challenge Johnson is setting himself is immense. The risk of a no-deal cliff edge at the end of the year will remain a key concern for financial markets and businesses.The second, arguably bigger, problem is that many at the top of government see erging from EU rules as the big prize of Brexit. While legislation enshrining existing EU standards in the areas of workers’ rights and the environment is likely, it’s doubtful this government will agree to follow EU rules in the future. Some senior ministers argue that alignment might actually be easier now as it will be the UK’s choice, but it’s hard to square this approach with the worldview and instincts of those now in power. Indeed, Johnson’s allies rightly point out that his opposition to both Theresa May’s Chequers deal and her withdrawal agreement was not because of details but because he believed it was fundamentally and philosophically the wrong approach.Could he prove more pragmatic – just as he was when he pulled off the withdrawal agreement against the odds? Perhaps, but probably only when talks reach a climax in the autumn. After all, not agreeing to follow EU rules would make it difficult to defend manufacturing industries from EU tariffs and regulatory barriers – in plain English, there would be a risk of substantial job cuts and factory closures. The newly elected band of Tory MPs from the north and the Midlands will be anxious to avoid that, and this might prompt a rethink. In the end, the government could be tempted to follow EU rules in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.But this is not a given. Senior voices in the cabinet tell me that the Tories’ new working-class former Labour voters are likely to be used as a justification to deliver a quick deal to deadline and for a tougher approach to immigration. The PM’s aides also acknowledge they will need a big selling operation to explain any new barriers to trade: “We will not go for high alignment that will mean trade-offs.” Another minister says that “standing up to the EU won’t play badly with these voters. There will be a deep reservoir of support for the PM if he wants to play tough with Brussels.” To the extent there are jobs that need protecting, this could lead to a more assertive industrial policy – including “buy British” procurement rules and state aid for companies struggling to survive, both of which will cause tensions with Brussels.A final, unresolved tension inside the government is whether to use the prospect of a US-UK trade deal to put pressure on the EU to make concessions. Some ministers want to go all out for “global Britain” from 1 February others want to prioritise the EU and believe such threats could be counterproductive.Given all of the above, a scrappy, relatively unambitious, low-alignment trade deal is arguably the most plausible landing zone, in contrast to a deal that keeps both sides economically close and the UK locked into the EU’s regulatory orbit. The risk of tariffs, not just regulatory barriers, is real. Despite hopes for a less fraught “phase II”, it seems likely that the UK’s noisy Brexit psychodrama isn’t going to quieten down any time soon.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c2c9373339e00c57738f4d79e520be7580f1c1/0_194_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b6b90b5ec32916daa89426219e405a0","title":"golden globes after parties in pictures","story":"Winners and nominees celebrate after the awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae65679f540462bcb7b13dc8e2e3728b96aff439/0_341_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757bd4f386da68d2a188852fcb813a91","title":"how make gluten free muffins taste good","story":"Beat the flour for longer, add xanthan gum, use less butter and more egg – making a decent, gluten-free cupcake or muffin is a cinch once you know howBoth my young grandchildren have been recently diagnosed as gluten-intolerant. I’ve always baked them cupcakes and muffins as treats, so now have to go back to the drawing board, but the amount of advice out there is bewildering. Help!Sue, St AlbansWhen it comes to cakes of any sort, it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that gluten-free has to mean a bit “meh” and dry. That’s mainly because many of us – especially those who don’t get adverse reactions to gluten – still believe that gluten-free flour has more in common with sawdust than with regular flour.Nothing could be further from the truth, says cupcake queen Jemma Wilson, who owns the Crumbs \u0026amp Doilies bakery in central London. “For things like cupcakes, sponge cakes and muffins, it’s actually very straightforward to make a decent, gluten-free version that bears a remarkable resemblance to the so-called ‘real thing’,” explains Wilson, who as a sideline also runs her own YouTube channel, Cupcake Jemma, which has more than 1.6m subscribers. Who knew that diddy little cupcakes were that popular?Wilson swears by Doves Farm’s gluten-free self-raising and plain flours and, crucially, uses them in the exact same quantities as you would in the original non-gluten-free recipe. This has the handy side-effect of negating one of all gluten-free bakers’ big bugbears: adjusting the proportions when converting measurements for gluten-free flour from regular flour without having to use a bespoke gluten-free recipe. Wilson does give her cake a helping hand, though: “To give it a lift, we beat the flour in for longer. There’s no danger of the sponge ending up tough, because the flour would have to have gluten in it for that to happen.”To give her gluten-free cakes a little extra bounce and spring, so they more closely resemble regular cakes, Wilson also adds a stabiliser that will already be familiar to any gluten-free baker: xanthan gum. This helps bind the dough and create a stronger crumb structure, but use only a teeny pinch, she warns: “If you overdo it, the end product will be rubbery.” As a basic rule of thumb, Wilson says an eighth of a teaspoon per dozen cupcakes or muffins, and a quarter-teaspoon for a 15cm layer cake, should be more than enough to be going on with.More broadly speaking, there are other avenues for Sue to explore in looking to free her go-to recipes from gluten. According to all-round baking Yoda (and former  columnist) Dan Lepard, by far the best strategy with gluten-free flour is to use less butter and more egg, together with ground nuts and other good-quality flavourings. “Fats inhibit starch particles from bonding when they’re heated, in much the same way as risotto rice that’s first been cooked in butter stays al dente,” explains Lepard. And if you’re worried that a reduced butter content means the cake will lose some of its richness, you can always just add more to the frosting, he says.“Gluten-free flour mixes are more or less blank flavour powders that need help to bind and taste good,” he adds. “While egg white is great at holding mixtures together, and pretty much essential when there’s no gluten, it’s also flavourless and a bit solid, so tweak the recipe to boost the flavour and texture.” In these circumstances, he says, ground almonds and top-notch vanilla are your best friends. Mind you, the same goes for pretty much all sweet baking, really."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4e5592ca8264a8d7bd719801c278ca23b46251/0_635_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8678d0ea550c6786c6072fd059f3ddc7","title":"weve always been honest about our weight loss the pinch of nom chefs on their recipe for success","story":"From posting healthy meal ideas on Facebook and running a restaurant, Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson went on to write bestselling slimming books that grew out of their own efforts to lose weight – and started a global phenomenonKay Featherstone and Kate Allinson were at a Spice Girls concert last spring, just two figures in a sea of people. As they gazed around the stadium, Kay broke down in tears. Not because of anything the Spice Girls were singing, but because the two chefs were consumed by the thought of their own followers they have more than 900,000 on Facebook. “When we go to a gig, it’s like: ‘We could fill this space so many times!’ It becomes very, very scary,” Featherstone says.They got the same feeling at Fleetwood Mac. Featherstone has sweaty palms just thinking about it. She and Allinson, who are business as well as life partners, try to “forget the noughts” and imagine a community of 900, but it’s still a long way from the days when they had their own restaurant with customers who came in every Sunday and even brought the pair presents if they went on a cruise.No wonder Allinson, 48, and Featherstone, 34, sound bewildered, if not downright terrified. Their success as the chef duo Pinch of Nom has been sudden. Last spring, their first book of simple slimming recipes sold 500,000 copies in just five weeks (and recently passed the 1m mark). Last month’s follow-up, Everyday Light, sold nearly 130,000 in its first week, knocking David Walliams from the top of the bestseller list.“It has been a little bit crazy,” Featherstone whispers, as if danger lurks nearby. They have had offers for TV shows – “offers for everything” – but have declined them all because they are “really shy”, says Featherstone, although she is “the gobbier half because Kate doesn’t usually like to talk”. (“That’s fair,” says Allinson, whose T-shirt is emblazoned with the slogan: “Introverts unite – separately in your own homes”.) When I ask if they might choose to meet their followers – I’m thinking of events – they say that they did bump into some once, and you can’t say it won’t happen again. “But it has never been about us,” Featherstone says, and Allinson, a sort of quiet chorus, echoes her words. “It’s never been about us.”This is something of a mantra for Featherstone and Allinson, and I’m intrigued by their wish to deny they are protagonists in their own enterprise. After all, many of their recipes are autobiographical. “Tin of praters”, a bacon, potato and onion bake, is lifted straight from Featherstone’s childhood, while the entire Pinch of Nom adventure took off when the two went along to their local Slimming World in Wirral four years ago, then began to post their own recipes to a growing Facebook community.Their personal story is at the heart of their business – but so is their disavowal of it. “We don’t spout about ourselves. We’re not that sort,” Featherstone says. They don’t take selfies even on their first date, the only picture they took was of a gull. Photographs of them are rare.In newspaper articles, Allinson and Featherstone are often described as “two fat chefs”. They laugh uproariously when I point this out. “Do you know we have a little list of the things we have been described as?” Featherstone says. “Fat. Middle-aged. Jolly.” Allinson chuckles. “We found it really funny,” Featherstone says. Then the tone abruptly shifts.“Sadly, it is the way that some people talk about people of our size. ‘Fat’ is a word that people will use willy-nilly to describe people of size. And I personally hate it,” Featherstone says. “It makes me angry deep inside …”In March, the pair revealed they were aiming to lose 190kg (30 stone) between them. Featherstone had so far lost 44kg and Allinson 31kg. I’m curious as to how they vied up the target. Featherstone says: “We came up with that between us.” They didn’t figure out how much each wanted to lose? “We’ve never really had a target,” Allinson says. “Because I think that can put a lot of pressure on.”“And we don’t do pressure,” Featherstone adds. But surely two books in the space of a year put pressure on them? “We don’t intentionally put pressure on ourselves,” Allinson says. “Is a better way of putting it,” Featherstone nods.I’m curious to know if they have lost more weight since the first book, but Featherstone says that the numbers are still what they were.The body of any diet author will always be taken as a measure of success. Is that on their mind? “It can’t not be,” Featherstone says. “We think about things a lot. It’s why we’re both so anxious all the time … We still struggle. Even now. We kind of fluctuate. We have a steady loss.” And while fluctuation and steadiness may seem at odds with each other, no doubt those who are sharing their weight loss “journey” will relate to the apparent contradiction.“We’ve always been really honest and open about it,” Allinson says.They have had an intense and challenging year, adjusting not just to huge public interest, but also to the loss of Allinson’s mum. Or, as Featherstone puts it: “We’ve had a great year, but we’ve also had a shit year.” Allinson’s mother died in January, the day after the couple told her they were going to publish a book. When Allinson says this, her eyes are wet and shiny.“Has anyone got a tissue?” Featherstone interjects. I assume she is asking for Allinson, but she quickly adds: “Because I’m wearing mascara and I know what’s going to happen.” Allinson fishes in her bag and passes her one. They happily rattle off their differences – Allinson is organised, decisive and likes strong tea Featherstone is disorganised, indecisive, talkative and takes her tea milky. But the two of them seem to understand and meet each other’s needs.They met nearly 15 years ago, having seen each other’s profiles on Gaydar Girls. “But I didn’t message you for ages,” Featherstone says. When they met, they got in the car and ended up in Rhyl, north Wales.Within six months, Featherstone had moved into Allinson’s family home in New Brighton, Wallasey, where the pair still live with Allinson’s older sister, Lisa, and her dad (whom the three of them look after) as well as two cats. “I’ve been in the same house for … how long is it? Forty-five years,” Allinson says. Before this one, she lived in the house over the back, which was her nan’s B\u0026ampB. I am trying to picture how the house – “just an old Victorian one”, Allinson says – must have felt with five adults in it. When they met, Allinson ran her own restaurant, Cromwells, in nearby Irby. Featherstone quickly took on front of house. Food was the driver of their relationship, and they went into work even when the restaurant was closed. “I washed the pots. I wanted to learn how this whole thing worked.” In their downtime, they watched, among other things, Two Fat Ladies (they have the DVDs) and ate lots of Chinese takeaways.While Allinson had been to catering college and had gone on to be the head chef for the Boddingtons chain, Featherstone had left school at 16. She had helped a bit in her parents’ florist shop and did voiceovers at a radio station in Liverpool, but food – and Allinson – provided a place that felt like home.The restaurant was hard work. Things came to a head when Allinson’s mum, who did the accounts, had a brain haemorrhage. Within a few months, the restaurant closed, as they focused on caring for her. “We grieved for the restaurant,” Featherstone says. “It hit us hard.” Next they worked for a Canadian IT company which, if I’ve understood correctly, speeds up the internet by using datacentres on the edge of the cloud. It sounds an unlikely fit, but both women say they wanted nothing to do with food after the restaurant shut. In between were months where “we didn’t do a whole bunch of much”.Then, in January 2016, Lisa persuaded them to go to Slimming World. They began to create the dishes that went into the first book in the “tiny” family kitchen that, they say, is smaller than the toilet in the offices of their London publisher, where we are meeting.They photographed their food at the dining room table. It must have been a squeeze, but Allinson’s mum said: “If you want to do it, do it well.” Allinson’s dad lost a stone unintentionally just by eating their food. Then at Slimming World one week, they heard another person discussing a Pinch of Nom recipe and realised how far they had come. At that point, no one in the group knew who they were.Now they have a test kitchen, a team of 11 and an army of followers they are scared to think about. Featherstone, Allinson and their family all eat the food they make. “When people are trying to diet, and the rest of the family don’t need to, it can feel as if you’re on your own,” Featherstone says. She knows this from personal experience. At her all-girls’ school, she was “the tall one and the big one” and dieted to fit in, but was bullied. “The experience of being different hardened me,” she says. But I suspect this hardening is a work-in-progress.I am surprised, when I get home, and reread the articles that describe Allinson and Featherstone as “two fat chefs”, to see that the person who chose those words was none other than Featherstone herself. I email her to ask why, given how the description angers her, and she replies that “it was a way of saying it first … It’s an ownership thing.

While he steered the club to the Premier League title in his first season in England, he was fired a year later after Chelsea finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Victory against Manchester United in the FA Cup was not enough to save Conte, who had 12 months left on his contract when he was fired.Conte’s relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy was far from smooth. There were regular disagreements over transfer policy and a legal battle ensued over Conte’s pay-off in the wake of his dismissal. Conte, who brought an 11-strong backroom team, won the case last year and the full extent of the payout has now emerged. It means that Chelsea, who had argued the former Juventus manager was in breach of his contract, have paid out more than £90m in compensation to sacked managers since Abramovich took ownership of the club in 2003.The accounts, published on Tuesday and covering the financial year ending 30 June 2019, read: “Exceptional items in the current year of £26.6m relate to changes in respect of the men’s team management and coaching staff, together with associated legal costs.”Chelsea, whose turnover increased from £422.6m to £423.6m, cited increased wages and reduced profit on player sales as the principal reason for their £96m loss. They now have the sixth highest wage bill in Europe and their accounts also showed that growth in commercial income was offset by a £7m fall in matchday revenue and a £4m fall in broadcasting revenue, which the club attributed to the impact of playing in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.However, there was a renewed show of commitment from Abramovich, whose future at Chelsea has been questioned since the British government delayed renewing his Investor (Tier 1) visa in May 2018. The Russian abandoned his UK application after the delay and took Israeli citizenship for which, being Jewish, he qualifies automatically. In the 20 months since the delay he is not thought to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK.Chelsea are free to spend this month after their transfer ban was lifted and Frank Lampard, the manager, is thought to have a budget of £150m. Lampard’s main targets include Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha, Lyon’s Moussa Dembele, Red Bull Leipzig’s Timo Werner and Bournemouth’s Nathan Ake.Danny Drinkwater has joined Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season. The former Leicester midfielder returned to Chelsea last week after Burnley decided not to extend his initial six-month spell last week and Villa have acted quickly to bring him in. Drinkwater appears to have no future at Chelsea.Villa had inquired about taking Michy Batshuayi or Olivier Giroud on loan but the signing of Drinkwater means they cannot borrow another player from Chelsea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/540c8dd12404617fe70ba603ba4a44efce7bf579/0_54_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5300ccbe999d1950ba6366b0e30649f9","title":"the fiver fa cup draw football","story":"Sign up now!

It’s been downhill ever since, and now we’ve just completed a third round with no shocks whatsoever. And no, suddenly noticing that Nasty Leeds are fun to watch these days because you’ve just caught them on telly after the One Show doesn’t count.Perhaps the fourth round will serve up better fare, though The Fiver, who much prefers the Leasing Trophy these days because at least they’re up front about the age groups, very much doubts it. The standout tie of the draw is Watford or Tranmere Rovers v Wolverhampton Wanderers or Manchester United, and that’s only because it wraps around two lines in the list, even if you flip your tablet sideways. Your eye’s naturally drawn. Enjoy that while you can, because when the replays are decided it’ll fit back on to one, melding into the pack, and then there’ll be absolutely nothing to focus on at all.

The Fiver, sniping from the sidelines and none too clever, has of course very little to contribute to the debate. Other than a vague idea to take the draw off live prime-time TV and stage it once again on a weekday lunchtime behind the firmly closed doors of a classical pile in the West End, to be conducted by two octogenarians fiddling around with a velvet bag, desperately trying to sit bolt upright, for if they lean forward, 75cl of vintage port will cascade from each nostril.

So can we all become millionaires like him if we devote ourselves to Eckhart Tolle and learn the power of ‘I’?How would any of us know it was new year if the papers weren’t full of articles about how to improve ourselves written by people so clueless about life that they opted for the media as a long-term career? Such guidance has been especially prevalent this year, maybe because it’s a new decade or maybe because these kinds of articles are a lot easier and cheaper to produce than proper investigative journalism – who really can say? But I would like to draw everyone’s attention to one article published over the weekend, about how we can all lead better lives, written by none other than British radio’s own Chris Evans (as opposed to Hollywood’s own Chris Evans). Because, truly, no one is better qualified to give life guidance than a man who, in 2000, at the age of 34, gave the then 18-year-old Billie Piper a silver Ferrari, even though she didn’t know how to drive.Ah, but that’s all very much in the past, Evans assures us, because he is now ENLIGHTENED. He proves this at some length in an article that itself seems to defy the very notion of space and time, with observations including: “Newton saw his falling apple one day and declared: ‘Look! Gravity!’ That was his identity that day, he became the gravity guy. But what about the tree whence the apple fell? The tree that had defied his gravity in the first place, rising skywards, majestically, towards the stars.” The headline on the article is I Have Seen the Light, but the editors could have saved themselves a few characters and just titled it, more accurately, Made Ya Think.Evans thrillingly reveals all the things he has learned with such aperçus as: “Everything you really want, you already have” (probably true of a man who owns one of the most expensive car collections in the country) and: “We say: ‘I am not myself today,’ but we never say: ‘Myself is not my I today.’” Made ya think!If you’re thinking: “Sounds like my man was given some Eckhart Tolle for Christmas,” you would not be far wrong. Tolle – the favoured writer for all narcissists – has indeed shaped what I guess we can call Evans’ “thinking”. But, true to form, Evans doesn’t just like Tolle – he worships him. He is, Evans says, in a line that is a million times funnier than anything that was in Zoolander 2, “my No 1 guru” Evans has read The Power of Now every year for the past two decades, a habit that has been scientifically proven (maybe) to have a more corrosive effect on the brain than long-term cocaine use. “Manifestation is the art of making what you want to happen happen. It is a real superpower available to us all,” Evans continues, and there, I’m afraid, I must manifest cutting him off.It is quite something how these guys all go the same way, isn’t it? They make too much money and then decide to show their humility by adhering to some kind of cod quasi-mysticalreligious theory that conveniently always puts them at its godlike centre. Kanye West has taken this to the extreme, with his VVVVIP invitation-only weekly gospel services, and poor old Tom Cruise took it further still, advocating the benefits of Scientology with a mad glint in his otherwise dead eyes. But Evans suggesting everyone can become a millionaire like him if they just read enough Tolle isn’t far off. What’s striking about Evans is that even the most coked-up British celebrities generally avoid this pitfall by clinging on to some vestiges of humour and self-awareness. Robbie Williams at his most nonsensical was always funny about his nonsense, while Noel Gallagher has made a whole post-Oasis career out of laughing at the whole shebang. Evans, however, can now be found in Sunday papers opining “‘I’ is everything.” Isn’t it just?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d97e880bb47d8037a63e27574adb1a41cfe5796/195_200_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eee0c2258b0b5cb958fb5147d6baa50d","title":"can sun simulator improve winter mood lethargy","story":"The sudden white blaze disorients me, like a cockroach caught in the kitchen. But will it make me feel better?Are you feeling depressed? Lethargic? Is it because every year our social, environmental and economic situation gets worse? Or is it because reduced daylight has negatively affected your circadian rhythm? If the latter, then I have good news! There’s a lamp for that.Vitamin L by Lumie is a powerful rectangular sun simulator that “treats the symptoms of winter blues and Sad”. Ah yes, seasonal affective disorder, setting the bar for sarcastic acronyms in the diagnostic field. (Provocative aside: the latest science finds depression to be a stable phenomenon, unrelated to seasons.) Still, we like the comfort of medical terms. Even the device’s name plays into this. Vitamin L? Come on, now. Vitamin Nice Try.Light therapy stimulates the retina, to suppress the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and increase levels of mood-boosting serotonin. And, lordy, that sounds good to me because another 12 months of this hot mess I cannot do. Vitamin L is slimline – roughly the size of a library reference book – portable and UV-free.I slot in the kickstand and set it on my desk at a 20cm distance to receive the full 10,000 lumens. This is important. At a 30cm distance, my retinas would only receive roughly half that, and at 40cm about half again, twice doubling the treatment time needed to feel any effect. Basically, you have to be intimate with the light. A friend owns a larger, older light box and takes it to bed with him. Whatever gets you through the night, I suppose.I give my own, compact Lumie the once-over, trying to find the button to turn it on. When I do, my face is right up next to the screen. The sudden white blaze disorients me. I am a cockroach caught in the kitchen. A prisoner halfway up a wall. I’m in the dentist’s chair.I recover my senses and try to adjust to the knockout field of photons. It feels stark and chilly. The experience reminds me of the time I changed my bedside lamp but didn’t realise I had bought a bulb that had too high a wattage. When I turned the light on, my boudoir resembled a chamber of extraordinary rendition.I use it for a week: 30 minutes in the morning, a top-up session a few hours later. During this time, the sky is always fifty shades of grey: dreich beyond belief. I come to appreciate the little window of energy. Particularly in the afternoons, when the light is extinguished before teatime, and I begin to feel less like I’m hugging a strip light in Bar Italia at 4am.I drink up the lumens and focus more on the panel itself, and its texture. The LEDs are covered with a “rippled diffuser” – a plastic face with a granular feel quilted into diagonal bands. It is rigid, but with the topography of a padded surface, which does soften the quality of the white light. Does it soften the understanding that humanity is walking towards a cliff-edge? Not really! It’s just a lamp. But still.It does keep me awake while it’s on. Yet it doesn’t feel natural to constantly sit right next to a bright light. It’s hardly a bay window on an August morning, where the light feels constant and enveloping, even as you move around.It wouldn’t be fair to criticise Lumie for failing to replicate the power of the sun. (Although it probably has before, in its sunrise alarm clocks, which are terrific.) But as soon as I turn Vitamin L off, the urge to sleep is still there. I can’t say my mood or lethargy have improved. It doesn’t work for me, this sitting next to a big lamp, although others swear by it.One morning during my trial, the sun emerges briefly from the blanket of grey, like a David Bowie cameo in Zoolander, reminding me what radiance looks like. The sun engulfs Lumie’s light, warms my blood and makes the room come alive. It’s good to remember that she is always up there, even when we can’t see her when the forecast is bad, the clouds endless. Shining bright as ever, forcing everything to grow and live. The days are getting longer. Everything’s not lost.Why not just call it “nappers’ delight” or the “winterval boo-hoos”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfaf760ec878247a3af49c97fd61a9792e68d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87477c5c73f628d3939dddf990d80a03","title":"tell us about outstanding customer service you received","story":"We want to hear from people who have received exceptional customer serviceAfter the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care.At this time of year, ’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories.Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues.Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers.We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.Has a trader driven through the night to ensure your goods reach you in time or soothed a situation with imaginative aplomb?Tell us about your experiences in the form below – one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further and we’ll publish a selection as part of an upcoming feature.If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

Divisions have grown, it says, partly as a result of housing market trends, with wealth concentrated among older generations who tend to live in towns and rural areas while younger people gravitate towards cities.United for All Ages, which was set up in 2010, supports intergenerational projects as a way of tackling key social and economic issues, including housing, anxiety and loneliness.Its report, Together in the 2020s, highlights recent progress with a growing number of intergenerational initiatives, including projects which bring together children in schools and nurseries with older people in care homes.The report calls for care homes to become community hubs for schools to extend their opening hours to provide community spaces for intergenerational activities and an increase in home-sharing schemes to promote intergenerational living.Other proposals include designating a bank holiday as a national day of unity to help bring the country together and a new government department for connection dedicated to supporting intergenerational action.Stephen Burke, a director at United for All Ages, said: “Bringing Britain together is one of the biggest challenges for the new decade. The last decade saw huge disconnection and ision.“More mixing between the generations is the way to build trust and understanding across our communities and our country. To make it happen requires not just vision and ambition, but also political will and leadership locally and nationally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab5fb266d0fbd2c75904fb285fefd1b17c6416f/1107_478_3416_2049/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f491713fe35eaa923a09e1c3c2483b1b","title":"ricky gervais rugby union honesty","story":"If the Golden Globes host ever does oval-shaped speeches he will have no shortage of similarly juicy targets at which to aimPerhaps the best way to embark on a shiny new rugby decade is to listen to Ricky Gervais’s coruscating speech at the annual Golden Globe awards. Fair play to the boy Gervais, there was absolutely no dull, formulaic box ticking (or kicking) involved. “If Isis started a streaming service you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you?” he challenged his wincing audience, before slaughtering virtually every other traditional sacred cow in Hollywood within seven and a half minutes.If Ricky ever does oval-shaped speeches he will have no shortage of similarly juicy targets at which to aim. “So, how come it’s taken this long for anyone to be publicly punished for breaking the Premiership salary cap?” might be a nice opening question. “How come there are all these playing laws and you don’t apply half of them?” would be another. Or “If you really love Pacific Island rugby, why don’t their teams receive a share of your home gate receipts?”And so on and so on. It has become a regular appeal but, notwithstanding an excellent World Cup in Japan, rugby needs a fresh injection of honesty and transparency if it wants to be in a significantly healthier state in 2030 than it is now. Never has the game sought to sell itself as more open and accessible while simultaneously remaining such a closed book on issues that affect almost everyone who plays or supports the sport.Take the Saracens salary cap saga. It is neither to support nor to criticise Nigel Wray – who has given far more to rugby than many – to say his decision to step down as the club’s chairman does not mean the end of this affair. Until the publication of the full content of the judgment that prompted Premiership Rugby to hand down its mega fine of £5.3m and a 35-point deduction there can be no real closure on either side of the argumentExeter remain upset – genuinely so – at the hidden human cost they believe should be factored into the whole Saracens “cheating” equation. The players the Chiefs had to let go because they could not fit all of them under the supposedly immovable cap, the extra depth of squad their rivals ended up being able to carry, the shattered dreams of others who, had there been a level playing field, could have secured a Premiership winner’s medal and now never will. They also think it is naive to imagine that Saracens’ extremely smart coaching staff were unaware about the joint business and property arrangements between their star players and Wray which, while legal in themselves, potentially opened up a way to retain them on salaries below their full market value.Sarries, to their credit, are looking to confront such negative perceptions in the coming days and weeks and demonstrate – beyond any scintilla of doubt – they are operating in full accordance with the regulations. It makes it even more essential that Premiership Rugby also releases the full details of the judgment – redacted in places if necessary – to allow everyone to put the matter behind them and help dissolve the stain that has left people openly querying whether the champions should also have had their domestic titles taken away. One man’s cavalier accounting – supposedly Sarries’ downfall – is another man’s flat-out cheating. Until all the facts are available to scrutiny, the argument will rumble on.It is the same, to some extent, with the “new money” coming into the sport via the private equity company CVC. Already agreements have been reached for shares of the commercial rights of Premiership Rugby and the Pro 14 and soon enough a ground-breaking deal with the Six Nations will be announced. Have we heard a syllable from CVC? Not yet. Is mortgaging the entire sport really going to yield only positive returns? Who knows? Has anyone from the RFU or Premiership Rugby or the Six Nations or anyone else stood up and publicly explained exactly why it is the deal of the century for rugby? Not yet.Which leads us indirectly back to the labyrinth that is the law-book. If Gervais was talking to World Rugby he would be asking some more pertinent questions. Why is the offside line not being enforced more often in a sport in which the number of heavy collisions is already a concern? What about the breakdown: how come players are still at risk of life-changing injury from opponents steaming in to “clear them out” or peel them off with a neck roll? How come “jacklers” routinely get away with not supporting their own weight? What lasts longer: an entire Golden Globes speech or the average scrum-half’s pre-box-kick routine?We could go on. Players in front of kick-offs, the endless prodded kicks to the corner following an attacking penalty. Nothing wrong with a good maul, clearly, but every time? There is a case for setting a maximum limit on how often per game a side can employ that option, both for player welfare reasons – those endless head-on tackles take their toll – and to vary the spectacle. Could it be that elaborate old-school tap-penalty moves and drop goals would re-emerge from the dusty vault to which they have mostly been consigned?Players, for their part, could be encouraged, like Ellis Genge at the weekend, to speak their mind with more freedom, rather than restrict themselves to corporate speak or in-house channels. How are they going to earn one of those precious TV summariser gigs if they opt not to engage with the media during their playing days? It is the same with international coaches: if you slag off the media and actively encourage players to behave likewise, where is the long-term benefit for anyone, sponsors included?In short, it is time for some different thinking. Want to enhance the spectating experience? Stop selling three-pint jugs that require spectators to visit the toilets three times per half. Fancy improving merchandise sales? Get teams playing in kit that looks genuinely classy and collectable, rather than charging extortionate amounts for a pale abomination of a change strip. Want to save money? Review the kind of over-large leagues that require semi-professional or amateur teams to travel ridiculous distances every fortnight for a game. Looking to increase rugby’s live audiences? Stage more women’s, age-group or sevens games on alternate weekends instead. And what if none of the above happens? Just phone Ricky. He’ll tell it to them straight.It was interesting to read Ronan O’Gara in a thought-provoking column in the Irish Examiner suggesting that part of the reason Ireland tend to underperform at World Cups is that relegation is not part of the domestic equation. Currently based at La Rochelle in France, O’Gara floated the possibility that a relentlessly significant fixture schedule sharpens players’ competitive instincts more than sitting out occasionally mundane Pro14 fixtures. Clearly it does not affect Ireland’s performance in Europe and fresh bodies and minds should always be a plus but maybe this Six Nations will provide further evidence. If England and France both show up well in the championship, having returned from the World Cup straight back into the maelstrom of their dog-eat-dog domestic competitions, it might explode a few myths about top level preparation.The penultimate round of European pool games this weekend pales into insignificance beside the health of the 27-year-old Worcester lock Michael Fatialofa, who suffered a serious neck injury against Saracens on Saturday. Fatialofa has been in intensive care since being injured in a collision shortly after coming on as a replacement. Michael was due to have an operation on Monday evening and everyone in rugby sends their love and best wishes to him and his wife Tatiana.

It’s been a fantastic day of Test cricket, up there with the best. Cheers for dropping in. Here’s our report:Some people might think there’s a place for it but you don’t want to miss out on days like today. You don’t want to miss out on games like this. I mean, this is what makes Test cricket what it is. Going right down to the wire. Nearly a full house at Newlands. And what a great finish to a brilliant game of cricket.Here’s Joe Root, who is happy with the team - “the guys stood up and put in a real team effort” - and with himself - “I thought I did a couple of things pretty well this week”:I thought I did a couple of other things pretty well this week. You’re always only as good as your players and we had a really strong message about how we wanted to perform and we stuck to that and really drove that really well. There’s things we tinkered with throughout, especially in the field, that fell into place really nicely. For long periods of time we were excellent, we built pressure and we followed it through. It’s a good marker going into the rest of this series and future tours as well.The man of the match is ... Ben Stokes, who tries to bring Dom Sibley up with him:I thought Dom put all the hard yards in to get us into a position of winning, so he should be the one up here. He’s trying to run away as fast as he can. I think credit’s got to go to everyone who’s played this week. Sam Curran, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope and Dom have shown how good they are. The future looks great for us and hopefully this is a stepping stone. When you have series and the first two games are results, it makes things very interesting, and it’s why five-day cricket should always be around. It’s the best format of the game and it makes cricket ... you know, games like these are just unforgettable. We’ll remember this for a long time and I’m sure South Africa will. It’ll go down as one of the greats.Joe Root, who has had one of his best days as captain today, has a chat:It was fantastic. A brilliant performance by the whole group of players. Showed a great amount of character, patience and a lot of belief as well today. Credit to South Africa, they threw a lot back at us, but the guys really stuck to it, put in a brilliant performance. A brilliant way to start the year. For a young group of players to be involved in a Test match like that is a great opportunity for us to move forward. We found ourselves at times under a lot of pressure but some iniduals really stood up and put in some brilliant performances that got momentum back in our favour. The way Jimmy bowled in that first innings was outstanding, and then you’ve got guys like Ben Stokes who can just change the game for you. Time for the post-match presentations, with Faf du Plessis the first to be called up:What an advertisement for Test cricket. Obviously sad that we’re on the losing side but all I’m asking for is that we fought and fought very hard, and we did that. Over five days, there has to be a winner and credit to England for just a little bit more in the tank than we have. It was a great Test match. Obviously a good variety in the wicket as well: day one and two probably bonus wickets, and then towards the end it got a bit flatter to bat on. But big series like this you want two teams to bash it out for five days. The next Test will be very exciting.What pleases me is the fact we’ve found someone who’s really good at the top of the order in Pieter Malan. Technically extrmeely sound, knows his game well, and those are the things you’re nervous about when there’s a bit of transition, how are the new players going to do when they come in? He’s stepped in and obviously played one of the great innings. We’ve shown we’ve got another opener who can play Test cricket for us. From a batting point of view not where we want to be yet, but today was a great step in the right direction. Most teams would come when the chips are down and probably fall after lunch or fade away. For me it’s a huge step for us as a young batting unit, showing a lot of character and fight. Today we lost with the right character, and I’m proud of that.England’s Barmy Army has been extremely loud all day, and their support was possibly decisive in keeping the side motivated during the longueurs of the afternoon as De Kock and Van der Dussen settled in. The team is back out now, thanking them for their support.Ben Stokes has picked up a few more fans today:Here’s Abhijato Sensarma: “Some genius is measured on paper, while some genius is measured in emotions. Ben Stokes is a man of moments, not numbers. His affinity for big moments makes him a big man. How lucky are we to live in the same generation as this man?”And Robert Ellson: “It’s rough on Sibley, but I reckon Stokes is the man of the match. Brilliant catches, and a sensational innings yesterday to give England the time they needed to win the game. Then a heroic spell at the end. What a man.”Here’s a quick report on England’s victory:Vernon Philander does a lap of honour after his final Test appearance at Newlands. Meanwhile, Quinton de Kock talks:I think the boys fought very hard. The English made it very difficult for us at times and they kept fighting. Credit to them. Obviously we tried to push them as far as we can. We knew today was going to be hot and sunny and the bowlers were going to be spending a lot of time on their feet, so we tried to push them as hard as we can. Unfortunately we just fell a little bit short.Zak Crawley, who contributed a couple of cracking catches to the England effort, says the two-stage effort to dismiss Nortje was “a bit lucky” and concludes: “This was unbelievable. Best game of cricket I’ve ever played in.”Yeah, very special. The crowd has been exceptional today. It’s been an incredible day’s play and a great Test match actually. We had to work incredibly hard. I think we knew we were going to have to do that from yesterday’s play. Incredible discipline from South Africa throughout the day, but we kept saying, one bit of magic ... We tried some funky fields. One breakthrough and we could apply some pressure, and fortunately we got that. Of the Van der Dussen dismissal, when Anderson took the catch moments after being moved to leg slip, he says:To be honest, I put a leg slip in try try to get him to stay leg side, to try and bring the edge into play, and then missed my line by about three foot and it ended up getting guided to leg slip. You need a bit of luck chasing 10 wickets, then you need a hell of a lot of character and skill.For the record: Philander c Pope b Stokes 8 (South Africa 248 all out)And also, stick that in your four-day Test pipe and smoke it, or whatever.Sky lose the feed, they cut to a still of a distant cricket ground and make their apologies ... and then they cut back to the action, Stokes bangs one in, and Philander fences straight to gully!137th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 1) Bess bowls at Rabada, with seven fielders clustered round the bat, but doesn’t really find the length required to bring them into play. Nine overs to go 136th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 1) Stokes has three shots at Rabada and three at Philander, without reproducing the magic of his previous over. Bess now will get a go at the new man. 10 overs to go135th over: South Africa 245-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 0) Bess bowls to Philander, whose decision to turn down an easy run at the end of the 133rd over didn’t turn out so well. Five dots and a boundary off the last mean that Stokes will have a bowl at Rabada next. 11 overs to go134th over: South Africa 241-9 (Philander 4, Rabada 0) The last hour or so has been just phenomenal sport. The absolute pinnacle. Am I alone in being a tad disappointed that Stokes’ two wickets here - his first of the match, bizarrely - look likely to end it a little earlier than necessary? 12 overs to goHe’s gone first ball! Another edge, and the slip cordon - five of them! - is so close that it’s almost past Crawley when he sticks out a right hand to deflect the ball up and into the air with his right, and then catch it with his left as it comes back down!He’s edged this one, and Root has taken a terrific low catch at slip!133rd over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) Root brings in another short leg as Bess bowls to Philander. There’s a leg slip, a leg gully and two short legs, as well as a slip and a silly point, but this time they get no catching chances. The last ball is sent squirming past point and South Africa turn down a run. Pretorius survived the last Stokes over and clearly concluded that he fancies a bit more, which is just remarkable. 13 overs to go132nd over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) A couple of rippers from Stokes go cruelly unrewarded. Stokes gets Pretorius to hang out his bat, but can’t quite find the edge, then squares him up with another beauty. Then the third in this trifecta of terrificness stays low, and the batsman does brilliantly to get his bat on it. The next ball is pretty great as well. How Pretorius survived that over I do not know, but it was fantastic viewing. 14 overs to go 131st over: South Africa 241-7 (Philander 4, Pretorius 0) Bess’s first ball comes off the bat, into the pad, loops up gently and then plops down to earth. Short leg shuffles a little shorter. Then Philander thumps a full toss down the ground, but the bowler gets a hand to it. And then, runs! Philander tonks one through the covers for four, to get off the mark from his 31st delivery! More thrills from the last, which clips the bat and flies into the space between short leg and leg gully. That’s drinks, taken with 15 overs to go130th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Stokes is back, with the crowd greeting with delight the complete absence of action that follows every delivery. The last leaves a cloud of dust as it comes off the pitch and zips just past Pretorius’ bat, a cracker. The batsman remains uncracked. That’s maiden No11. 16 overs to go129th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Philander decides it’s about time he scored a run, and swings his bat at a couple of Bess deliveries. He doesn’t get hold of either of them, and this is thus maiden No10. In short, ostensibly nothing at all is happening, and it’s absolutely unmissable. “Have been driving from the south of Cameroon to the north today, following on radio and OBO,” writes Anna Halford. “Just felt the need to add my voice to those raging against the philistine idea of cutting the fifth day - I would not have been making sure I had credit for a data connection for a measly fourth and final day in this test. Having arrived after 8 hours on the road, I am finally able to join the OBO community in their biscuit-dunking as well as the cricket (tea, and something more or less equivalent to a malted milk biscuit - don’t judge, Cameroon’s biscuit selection is sadly limited).” 17 overs to go127th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Another maiden from Bess. Run-scoring is pretty low on everybody’s list of priorities. Philander has faced 20 balls so far. 19 overs to go126th over: South Africa 237-7 (Philander 0, Pretorius 0) Another maiden, this one containing the considerable bonus of Van der Dussen’s wicket, rendered all the sweeter because the fielder who took the catch did so having spent about 20 seconds in situ. Anyway, that’s maiden No7: the world record is 25 in a row, so we still have time to shatter that here. 20 overs to goGot him! Broad sends one just down the leg side, and Van der Dussen works it off his hip and straight to Anderson, who had just been moved from mid on to leg slip!125th over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Philander sees off another Denly over, by my count a sixth successive maiden. 21 overs to go 124th over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) A second slip comes in for Broad here, and there’s a gully there as well. Broad tries to bring them into play by bowling wide of off stump, which only allows Van der Dussen to leave the ball completely. After a couple of these deliveries the bowler tweaks his radar and straightens, but the batsman’s defensive game is strong. Then he ends the over with the best of both worlds, one that jags back in, but it’s just wide of off stump! 22 overs to go123rd over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Another maiden, Denly this time the bowler. “It’s a truth universally acknowledged that a captain in search of wickets must be in want of some close fielders,” notes Tom Carver. “Solitary slip? Three men around the bat when the spinner was on earlier. How is Capt JR planning to get the Saffers, historically known to be impossible to bore out, out on a dying wicket? Granted, if there’s no swing then there’s no need for slips and if the pitch isn’t taking spin then close fielders are also a bit superfluous. So is there a discernible plan? 210 or so runs to play with 4 wickets needed. Surely worth a few more close fielders just in case the ball hits a crack or something…” There’s one slip, a short leg and a silly point here for Philander, but they get no exercise. 23 overs to go122nd over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) Broad, having been rested during the last session to allow him a go at potentially fresh batsmen in this one, bowls another entire over at Van der Dussen, who has now faced 129 balls for his 17 runs in what has been a magnificent rearguard effort. This just in from Kim Thonger: “Dipping one’s biscuit sounds a great more savoury than this from my Faber Dictionary of Euphemisms, which lives in the downstairs loo: ‘Dipping Cecil in the hot grease’. Clue, nothing to do with biscuits.” This I fear is dangerous territory for the OBO. 24 overs to go121st over: South Africa 237-6 (van der Dussen 17, Philander 0) So England take the vital wicket of De Kock, and then cook their final review. The match returns to its knife-edge. 25 overs to go.The question is whether the ball flicked the glove on its way up off the pad. The umpire thinks not. England think it’s worth checking. It wasn’t: the ball flicked a forearm.From nothing, from nowhere, for no reason, Quinton de Kock swings his bat and thunders the ball to Zak Crawley at mid on! 120th over: South Africa 237-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 50) Hello sailor! Broad replaces a clearly ailing Anderson, and his first two deliveries are wide of off stump and left alone, his next is straight and defended, and then comes a ripper, a cutter that moves away from Van der Dussen and just past the edge. Still no wicket, though.118th over: South Africa 233-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 46) Four balls into the over, broadcasters pick out five or six England fielders as they all clap and shout encouragement at each otherthemselves. Anderson stays faithful to a line well outside off stump, and Van der Dussen doesn’t feel compelled to play. Meanwhile Joachim Demnitz has an important point of information on the subject of biscuit-dunking: “Here in Brazil molhar o biscoito (to dip your biscuit) means ‘to get your leg over’,” he writes. “Just thought all cricket and OBO lovers ought to know.”117th over: South Africa 233-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 46) De Kock edges a Curran slower ball well wide of the solitary slip and away for four. It’s quite a fun field, littered with close fielders rather than having them in clusters, but a second slip would have come in handy then. Then De Kock does it again, more deliberately this time, for four more.116th over: South Africa 225-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 38) England are only one wicket from ... er ... only needing four more wickets, but that vital breakthrough remains elusive. Anderson’s over seems to bother him a fair amount more than it bothers the batsmen, but it’s a maiden.They’re back out, and Anderson is going to start the final session. This is going to the wire. Strap yourselves in.115th over: South Africa 225-5 (van der Dussen 17, de Kock 38) Bess overpitches, which he has tended to do a bit, and De Kock hits past point for four. And then a sniff of a wicket, as he edges the last ball before tea just short of Root at gully! So the batsmen survive, and South Africa have a real chance of drawing this. There are 32 overs to go today, not much more than the number this pair have already survived. Anyway, that’s tea. I’ll be back in a little bit. Here’s some teatimely reading for you:113th over: South Africa 219-5 (van der Dussen 16, de Kock 33) Root retires, unrewarded, and Bess gets another go. “As a Proteas supporter this is pretty tense - one wicket and it could all come tumbling down,” writes Richard Mansell. “I am reminded a bit of the 2005 Test against Australia where SA clung on for 126 overs to salvage a draw. One can hope...” That hope seems to be rising, with this pair refusing to be drawn into significant risk-taking. England will be desperate for some pre-tea cheer.112th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 16, de Kock 33) “I’d like to see you get out here like that. Imagine that,” says Stokes, as Van der Dussen hooks, safely, for a single. As well as some other stuff that isn’t picked up clearly on the stump mic, perhaps fortunately. 111th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 15, de Kock 32) More Root, no more worries for the batsmen. “The big OBO debate yesterday was Flintoff v Stokes, but even weirder than England’s ability to have produced three blond all rounders with super human powers is the inability to produce captains who grow stronger rather than weaker as they grow into the role. Where is our Steve Smith, our Graeme Smith? It’s not like we don’t have anyone called Smith in England,” says Andrew Williams. Who’s our best cricketing Smith? Should they just be fast-tracked into the job?110th over: South Africa 215-5 (van der Dussen 14, de Kock 31) Still Stokes, still no dice. De Kock is scoring a lot quicker than Van der Dussen, but still very slowly for De Kock: of innings of 50 balls or more, this is his third-slowest.109th over: South Africa 212-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 28) Root continues, with a slip, leg slip and short leg in place, and his first delivery skids out of the rough and past the edge of De Kock’s bat! Still no breakthrough, though, and England are teetering towards desperation.108th over: South Africa 211-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 27) A change of pace, and not for the first time England ask Ben Stokes to magic something up. His spells do not immediately work. Here meanwhile is this week’s Spin, courtesy of Michael Butler:107th over: South Africa 209-5 (van der Dussen 12, de Kock 27) Denly keeps rolling, and De Kock hoists the ball high to midwicket, where the complete absence of fielders makes the shot safe. I’m still getting emails about biscuit-dunking, a debate I am unable to enter or even officiate, being something of a hot-drink hater. I did go through a period of dunking a particular extraordinarily dull biscuit in orange squash once, but I don’t look back on it with any pride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce81dcc013de361b25a525f79afdb59abfe0f523/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7476ab640153709151fe8264ee85f5","title":"fringe binge world first vr theatre livr","story":"LIVR allows subscribers to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. How does it compare with the fringe experience?I’m having a beer and enjoying an Edinburgh fringe show from the front row. But I’m on the sofa rather than a folding chair, there’s a cat on my lap and the beer didn’t cost £6. While the pet and the beverage are optional, the large pair of goggles I’m wearing are not. Much fancier headsets are available but this one – which works with my smartphone – comes with a subscription to LIVR, “the world’s first virtual reality content platform dedicated to theatre”.It’s fringe theatre in particular that the company has focused on. The 360-degree VR experience situates you in the middle of the front row and lets you immerse yourself in the show. Instead of a conventional film, where the emphases have been predetermined in the editing suite, you can choose what to concentrate on. You can switch focus on different performers as they move around the stage and into the audience and, in a manner that would be downright shifty in the theatre, turn and gawp at your neighbours’ reactions to the show. All of this distinguishes LIVR’s service from, say, the polished and slickly edited productions available online from Digital Theatre, which also tend to have bigger budgets and starrier casts. The biggest actor in LIVR’s current offerings is Gyles Brandreth, whose Hamlet with his son Benet at Park theatre is one of the service’s most watched shows.Mostly, LIVR gives you a chance to experience fringe shows that you may have missed at a festival and, in some cases, are no longer being performed. Leo Kellgren-Parker, the company’s founder, says: “The majority of our audience is based outside London so they use it as a chance to catch things that may not have toured. We wanted to create a place where people can experience shows when it suits them. I like the idea of someone finding a gem long after it would have gone otherwise.” The current catalogue of 60-odd shows includes gig theatre, monologues, puppetry and comedy, with a new batch of titles added each month.While some acclaimed fringe hits have been adapted for short TV versions – such as Half Breed and Ad Libido, which both recently became Comedy Blaps on Channel 4 – this is a chance to relive the rough and ready original. It also allows users to graze on several shows, as you might at a festival.“Internationally, we are seeing binge consumption, particularly from the US,” says Kellgren-Parker. “As they have no name recognition they are picking shows they like the sound of with an entirely open mind. They seem to be watching more shows per month than we had expected people to.”I start my own fringe binge with Chase Scenes, which I missed at the Edinburgh festival in 2018. Ming Hon’s raw, traumatic and sometimes funny production recreates 60 movie pursuits in 60 minutes. Hon, whose work as a film classifier inspired the show, performs alongside two other actresses. They take turns to wield video cameras, filming each other, with the footage projected on a split screen behind them. If this sounds like it might be quite complicated to follow, the way you choose to frame the action yourself using VR – rather than watching an edited version of the production – neatly complements the performers’ methods. “Almost all my performances use live camera with live projection,” Hon tells me. “I’ve always been interested in how an audience experiences and navigates between watching live performers and the irresistible seduction of moving images on a lit-up screen.”Watching the VR version of Chase Scenes feels like you are in the middle of the show – props lie at your feet and you twist your neck around to follow Hon running in and out of the audience. Hon says that recording the show was simple. “The camera operator took one seat in the audience and the camera, which looks like a stick with a robot head, sits beside them. I was able to play up and perform to the camera like it was a real human audience member which was really fun.” She has been researching VR as part of her next show, Exciting Consequences, which explores the tropes and cliches of pornography VR porn – “about making the sexual experience as real as possible” – is booming.I check out some more of LIVR’s offerings. The Brandreths’ Hamlet, on a set dominated by a kitchen table, feels a tad flat to me, as does Famous Puppet Death Scenes, which has a set design like a Punch and Judy booth. Neither seems to take great advantage of the possibilities of VR, but then hardly any fringe productions are being designed with the technology in mind. That may change – and VR may well be developed to suit immersive and promenade performances. Electrolyte, a scrappy and energetic bit of gig theatre, is a good VR fit and I’m gripped by the immediacy of Apphia Campbell’s storytelling and singing in Woke. The technology also suits the decidedly analogue For the Record, an intimate solo show by the poet Toby Thompson, in which he shares coffee and LPs with the audience. It’s a black-box fringe experience perfectly preserved: you can look up to the low ceiling, count the audience members around you, and even hear mutterings from outside the venue.All of these productions were new to me so I watch one of my favourite shows from last year, Songlines by Tallulah Brown, recorded at Edinburgh’s Pleasance Beside venue. This teen romance, with live music, is even better than I remembered and this time I get a better view as I’m up close and dead centre in the first row. Sometimes that can feel awkward as an audience member – when I saw the unpredictable comic Jordan Brookes in the same venue I was sure to avoid the front row. There are hearty laughs during Songlines, and when I look around at my neighbours I’m surprised to find the venue is probably at half capacity it’s a striking contrast to the way filmed performances often try to convey a packed audience.Ming Hon, who is based in Winnipeg, Canada, says that the VR version of Chase Scenes means she can find audiences she’d never otherwise reach. But I wonder if other performers worry about the impact on ticket sales if their show is already available in a sophisticated version online. Although LIVR says it is happy to remove a film from the site when that show is out on tour, the activist and theatremaker Nathaniel Hall says the two are different experiences. He is about to tour the UK with his show First Time, which is also on LIVR. “VR can help us reach people in rural areas, or who are unable to travel, or feel uncomfortable in the restrictive atmosphere of the theatre space,” he adds. “First Time is a show that transforms people’s attitudes to HIV and HIV stigma – the more people that can access the story, the better. I’m excited about how VR could help address the cost of taking theatre to hard-to-reach audiences in the future. I would love to take 20 headsets to a school, watch the show together and then run a workshop afterwards. With correct investment, this could help get important but expensive theatre and stories into cash-strapped schools and community spaces.”In the future, VR versions of shows may be used increasingly by theatre programmers too, but Hall also stresses their importance for performers themselves. “I was intrigued to study my own performance using this technology. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to sitting with my audience, kicking back and just enjoying the show.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

The teenager stood motionless in the dock throughout, her head bent slightly as she listened to an interpreter.The suspended sentence will do little to allay what her lawyers described as an “incredibly sad and tragic case” for a young woman whose crime had been to report a sexual assault while on holiday in the party resort of Ayia Napa last July.The Briton turned from victim to suspect overnight when, in now disputed circumstances, she withdrew the rape complaint after eight hours of police questioning.Within hours of the retraction, the Israelis she accused of gang-rape, aged between 15 and 22 with most about to enter the army as conscripts, were allowed to fly home. Further investigation into the claims was dropped, with the woman being forced to spend a month in Nicosia general prison before being granted bail on condition she surrendered her passport.In what had been a highly anticipated moment, Tuesday’s sentencing came a week after the woman was convicted of wilfully indulging in public mischief for the offence of fabricating “an imaginary crime”. On the eve of the decision, speculation of a presidential pardon had mounted.Under the Mediterranean island’s penal code, the crime of fomenting public mischief is punishable by up to a year in prison with a penalty of as much as €1,708 (£1,450). The judge said the fine would be reduced to €140.The case has attracted international attention, far beyond the frequently bizarre court proceedings in a Cypriot town, with critics claiming it had illuminated the deficiencies of a system that failed to take reports of sexual assault seriously.“Whilst we welcome the fact that the sentence imposed today allows her to go home … the fight for her innocence will go on regardless,” said Lewis Power QC, who added that her legal team would contest the guilty conviction in Cyprus’s supreme court, and if necessary, the European court of human rights.“We say and will maintain that this young girl was stripped both of her dignity and basic human rights … This case has highlighted a gaping chasm in the specialised treatment of sexual assault victims in Cyprus,” he said.Women’s groups spurred into action in Cyprus had been emboldened by the backing of outraged Israelis, who also flew in to join protests. Many described Tuesday’s outcome as a “superficial victory”, backing the teenager’s pledge to oppose the sentence.Several Israeli men appalled by the student’s treatment were among them. Wearing a T-shirt with the words “Our sister I believe you”, Yuval Newman said he had been so “angry and shocked” over last week’s guilty verdict he had decided to fly into Cyprus with his 16-year-old son to show his disquiet.“To put all the blame on this young woman is so wrong,” said the 48-year-old, who works with disabled people. “So much needs to change in Israel around the way teenagers treat women. I have brought my son with me in the hope that he will learn from this and go away knowing that women need to be treated properly.”The Briton, whose mother said wanted to become a police officer, had been due to start studying criminology at university in the autumn. Since the alleged attack – described by the teenager as having occurred when she was having consensual sex with one member of the group – she has suffered severe post-traumatic stress disorder and has been taking anti-depressants.In the quest to prove her innocence, an expedited appeal request will be lodged with the island’s supreme court by 17 January to ensure the case is heard within six months, her senior Cypriot lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said.“We are all relieved that she will not have to go to prison and happy that the sentence is suspended, and she can get on with her life and take care of her mental health,” she said. “But we will pursue the appeal in an effort to have a final, positive acquittal decision.”Indicative of the diplomatic dimensions the case has assumed, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday: “Throughout this case our focus has been on ensuring the young woman can return home. We’re very pleased this can now happen. We hope she and her family will now be given space and privacy so they can start rebuilding their lives.”The spokesman said the Foreign Office would work with Cyprus and other countries on how to avoid similar cases in the future, but reiterated that the UK government had “numerous concerns about the judicial process of this case and the woman’s right to a fair trial”, and had raised these with Cyprus.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, expressed relief that the “vulnerable young lady” was about to return home after a harrowing six months that had elapsed since she first reported the incident.“I understand quite how much she’s been through and what her family’s been through,” he said. “We will be following up on some issues in relation to the case … There is the broader issue for Brits travelling not just in Cyprus or in the EU, but travelling abroad, whether it’s on holiday, whether it’s backpacking, and making sure they can do so as safely and securely as possible.”President Nicos Anastasiades’s administration had repeatedly said it could not interfere in the independent workings of the courts. Loudest among the protest chants heard as the judge read out his decision was “Cyprus justice, shame on you”.Verity Nevitt, who organised a march in London in solidarity with the teenager, called the Cypriot authorities’ handling of the case “farcical”. She added: “Today the judge proved that he is unfit to judge cases of sexual violence, he should be recalled from the role.“I am angry that the UK have behaved so pitifully in protecting one of their own, one who is already so vulnerable and in desperate need of support. Britain should have said no Briton is taking part in this farce of a judicial system and we are not allowing this joke trial to continue where a victim is being tried as a criminal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9b4f162bb160f57bd21096b178b0ece110389f/0_168_6731_4040/master/6731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822c2f6f9844ef9fa13092a2ca62386c","title":"south africa rail passengers left stranded more than day","story":"Railway operator apologises for delay of more than 24 hours to Johannesburg-Cape Town trainSouth Africa’s state-owned rail operator has apologised after passengers were left stranded for more than a day on a train from Johannesburg to Cape Town.Shosholoza Meyl said the train, which departed on Sunday, was scheduled to arrive in Cape Town on Monday evening.

Photograph: Dave MeehanHistorian Professor Diarmaid Ferriter has said the expert advisory group on commemorations never suggested there should be a State event for the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin politan Police. He took issue with a statement by the Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan who said on Monday that the proposed State commemoration was made “under the guidance of the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations”.Mr Flanagan responded to the mounting furore over the commemoration event on January 17th in Dublin Castle by stressing that it was never intended to honour the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries too. He added: “This event is one of a large number of events taking place during this decade to acknowledge and commemorate significant events or developments in the history of our island one hundred years ago. “It is not a celebration. It is an acknowledgement the historical importance of both the DMP and the RIC, and is in no sense a commemoration of the Black and Tans or the Auxiliaries.” Professor Ferriter said the advisory group, which comprises of himself and other professional historians under the chairmanship of Dr Maurice Manning, did not recommend that a service for the RIC and the DMP be included in the list of State commemorations. He explained: “What we stated was that ‘consideration should be given to the organisation of specific initiatives to commemorate the RIC and the DMP and to acknowledge their place in history’.“What we had in mind was an academic event - a conference or seminar - that would look at the issue of policing in Ireland during the revolutionary period, including the role of and disbandment of the RIC and the foundation of the Civic Guard, which became An Garda Siochana.”He said the advisory group “should not be used by the Government as a mudguard to provide cover for itself when it receives negative reaction to its solo runs in relation to commemoration. “The EAG is not an executive body it is an advisory group. We have consistently maintained that commemoration should be locally rather than centrally led.” Instead, he maintained, the group proposed that “the commemorative model to mark the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush is the correct approach to the observance of the sensitive and complex centenaries that will occur in 2020. “This approach advocates a leading role for local authorities in supporting and driving community-led commemoration, augmented with appropriate State assistance and participation. “The proposed RIC commemoration does not follow that model. What is being proposed was not put before the group and therefore was not discussed by the group and the minister should not refer to the event on 17th January in Dublin Castle as being as a result of our guidance.”Dr Manning said the advice given by the advisory group could be interpreted as including a State ceremony though he acknowledged that the group only specified a small number of State ceremonies. “It has never been our job to be prescriptive as to how events should be organised. It is up to the Government to decide the form it should be take. It is their absolute right to decide what should and should not be adopted,” he said.

Mr Varadkar has asked Mr Martin to support the Government in some Dáil votes if he wants to secure an election date. Mr Martin told Newstalk he will not change his approach, setting up a confrontation between the pair at a meeting on Thursday night to discuss the election date and the end of the confidence and supply deal. The meeting will take place in Dublin although the time and venue have not yet been confirmed.The confidence and supply deal has seen Fianna Fáil underpin the Fine Gael-led minority government sinc 2016. There is increasing speculation that the election date will fall within weeks, rather than months, with some Fine Gael TDs believing a February election is now on the cards. The Cabinet will hold a special meeting focusing on disability issues in Marino, Dublin, on Thursday. The venue is in the constituency of Finian McGrath, Minister of State for Disability Issues.Fine Gael Ministers and Ministers of State will hold a meeting on Friday morning, followed by a gathering of the Fine Gael parliamentary party that afternoon.Mr Varadkar has convened similar meetings previously at the start of Dáil sessions, but party TDs believe increasingly that he may call a February election. Some TDs and candidates were also last night sent templates for election canvass cards.Mr Varadkar is understood to have told people privately he wants the Stormont institutions back up and running before the election. The ongoing Stormont talks have a deadline of January 13th to succeed or fresh elections will be called in Northern Ireland. There has been some speculation in Fine Gael that, in the event of a successful conclusion to the Northern talks, Mr Varadkar could meet British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast to oversee the restoration of Stormont and that the pair could hold a meeting on Brexit and the future of British-Irish relations.Such a backdrop, suggest some Fine Gael sources, would provide a platform for him to call an election.In a letter, Mr Varadkar has asked Mr Martin to vote with the Government rather than abstain if required in some Dáil votes.Fianna Fáil’s John McGuinness has said he will vote against the Government if it faces a motion of no confidence. Mr Varadkar has also asked Mr Martin to agree a reform of the Local Property Tax. The requests are seen as being difficult politically for Mr Martin to agree to, leading many TDs to believe Mr Varadkar is preparing the ground for a February election.When the election is called the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are set to engage in a head-to-head general election debate, the first time the leaders of the two parties have squared off in 13 years.Both Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin are keen to hold a one-on-one debate during the forthcoming campaign. Mr Martin has already said he wants a head-to-head debate with Mr Varadkar during the campaign. And senior Fine Gael figures have confirmed Mr Varadkar favours such an encounter.Well-placed Fine Gael figures said they are open to two televised debates: one between all party leaders, including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Greens and potentially others, and one between the two contenders for the taoiseach’s office.The 2016 and 2011 campaign debates featured a number of party leaders.The desires of both party leaders is dependent on the attitude of broadcasters RTÉ and Virgin Media. An RTÉ spokeswoman said: “The RTÉ Election Steering Committee will make any decisions around debates held on RTÉ. A wide number factors are taken into account and decisions have not yet been made.”A Virgin Media spokeswoman said plans are being drawn up for its general election coverage, with a leaders’ debate a centrepiece of its coverage."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4133107.1578414414!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new science in old places museums are crucial part of scientific research","story":"Maybe over your Christmas holidays you wandered into a museum. Let’s just say it was a natural history museum. As you walked around, you might have been overwhelmed by the abundance of exhibits and mothball perfume. In Dublin, there are at least 10,000 items on display.Everything, as Nigel Monaghan says, “from ants to aardvarks to zebras”. My personal favourites in the Dublin Natural History Museum, where Monaghan is the keeper, are the pangolins. They are related to anteaters and I had never heard of them before I saw them there.Other specimens are fascinating for the history and stories behind them, like the trophy heads collected during British imperial expansion and the migratory birds gathered after they fatally collided with Irish lighthouses.But providing weird and wonderful displays for the public is only a small part of what historical museums do. A museum is a place of living science, not just a place of preservation. Modern science needs historical collections and facilitating research is a crucial part of “keeping” a museum. Monaghan and his colleague Paolo Viscardi (assistant keeper with a focus on zoology) are enthusiastic about the scientific treasures they work to preserve.Climate change and bioersity are some of the big areas of science that museum collections can help researchers to study. As Monaghan puts it, “Museum collections are key to understanding bioersity over the last few centuries.” And of course human actions have been a huge factor in reducing bioersity over the same time period.Monaghan points to a creative study using the museum’s 17,000 bird skins (birds that have been “boned and rolled”, he explains). Researchers interested in pollution have been examining old bird specimens to see what kind of particles have been clinging to their feathers for the past 100 or so years.More recent scientific methods allow researchers to make new findings from old material. For example, Monaghan’s own interest is in Irish ice age fauna. A research group that he has worked with has been using bones collected in Ireland (mostly in cave deposits) during the 19th and 20th centuries.With radio carbon dating and DNA analysis it is now possible to be much more accurate about which species were here and when. For example, scientists now believe that red deer actually arrived in Ireland with people around 5,000 years ago. The deer provided useful antlers for tools as well as meat and hides.Paolo Viscardi draws my attention to the research importance of some of the smallest organisms held by the museum. There is a lot of recent interest, for example, in a collection of parasitic wasps created in the middle of the 19th century by Alexander Haliday. He opens one of Haliday’s entomology cases to show me and it’s fair to say they are bit less charismatic than pangolins.Some of them are, as Viscardi says, “the size of a full stop”. Parasitic wasps “can be quite useful pest control agents” because different species of the wasps lay their eggs on those of another species of insect thus reducing its population without the need for pesticide.Thanks to Haliday’s enthusiasm, probably not driven by an interest in organic agriculture, the Dublin museum has around 1,000 type specimens of parasitic wasps and researchers working on the group are keen to access them. This has meant painstaking efforts by the team in Dublin to rehouse the specimens in modern storage to prevent loss or damage.Gluing tiny wasps to cards, as Haliday did, is no longer advised. Other collections of tiny organisms include thousands of nematodes (flatworms), many of which are type specimens. Many of these nematodes, Viscardi explains, came from an Irish bog and give information about soil health. While I am chatting with him Viscardi receives an email inquiry about the museum’s collection of stoats. They are of interest because Irish stoats are stoatally different (sorry) than British varieties: they don’t change their coat in the winter.There is something reassuring about the way that the Dead Zoo doesn’t change much. I can return and find my pangolins any day I like. But behind the scenes our natural history museums are full of evidence of change.Pangolins, for example, are under threat from poaching and might one day exist only in museum collections. The story of the changing natural world, and our role in that change, will continue to be the most important scientific story of the future.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.National Archives to trial 12-document limit per day for visitors, as academics warn research could be affectedBritain accused of \u0026#39not doing everything\u0026#39 to free nationals held in Iran after espionage charge dropped against French-Iranian academicPond scum could feed the world if used as a protein substitute for meat and eggs in meals, says Cambridge University professorComment: Harvey Weinstein is the poster child for our age of cynical victimhoodComment: Only a union of Unionists can defeat the rampaging SNPComment: Rebecca Long Bailey is the worst choice Labour could make.

It shows (Foreign Secretary Dominic) Raab that he is evidently not doing everything, despite the briefing.”He has previously said he believed his wife\u0027s release was dependent on the interest on a £450 million debt the UK has owed to Iran since the 1970s for a cancelled arms deal.Last week he said she would join Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian academic, in going on hunger strike.Ms Adelkhah, an expert on Iran and Shiite Islam, was arrested in Tehran in June last year and went on hunger strike on December 24 after she was refused bail.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, slammed her detention as “intolerable” and called for her release without delay, prompting Iran to castigate France for unacceptable interference in internal affairs. Mr Ratcliffe said France’s decision to meet with the Iranian ambassador over Christmas appears to have helped and that she may have been picked up for a prisoner swap, as was the case with the British-Australian tourists caught flying a drone last year. British-Australian national Jolie King and her partner Mark Firkin were released from Iranian arrest in OctoberThe prosecution also dropped its case against Ms Adelkhah for disturbing the public order.She still faces two other charges: spreading propaganda against the political system of the Islamic republic and conspiracy against national security”, said her lawyer Said Dehghan.Her Sciences Po colleague Roland Marchal was also arrested last June while visiting Ms Adelkhah and charged withcollusion against national security.Mr Ratcliffe said: Last Wednesday evening Fariba was moved out of solitary and joined the women’s ward, which is always a good sign.Our understanding is that Roland (Marchal) was also moved out of 2A at the same time. When she came into the ward a few days back she was still on hunger strike.She still is on hunger strike - and everyone is getting pretty worried. Only drinking water. And her weight had dropped below 40kg.”Mr Ratcliffe said she is now in a bad state, which might concern Iran.The Iranian authorities will be thinking through their options at this point, he said.He added: Our top priority at the moment is just to keep people safe.

Otherwise Nazanin and the others are going to become for the IRGC human shields.Sherri Izadi, 56, says hopes of her husband Anoosheh Ashoori being released from jail in Iran on espionage charge had been destroyedSherry Izadi, the wife of a British-Iranian engineer Anoosheh Ashoori - also held in prison in Tehran - has said she fears he no longer stands a “hope in hell” of being released after the US strike on Soleimani. Mrs Izadi, 56, said the Foreign Office had not been much help in her husband’s case, telling her there was little it could do as Tehran does not recognise dual nationalities.“It all depends how British government will react to this situation now,” she said. “I’m hoping there will be a rational reaction.”There are as many as five people with British connections or nationality that are being held in Iran.Jean-François Bayart, a friend and colleague of Ms Adelkhah and member of a Paris-based support group, welcomed the dropped charges, which he said was confirmed by French diplomats.He said it was “encouraging” that the court chose not to “harden” its position in light of the US airstrike, instead ruling that “the case against her was empty, as we knew all along”.But he said he remained “vigilant and prudent” given Iran’s “tough” track record of holding on to dual nationals.Death of the Christmas pudding as consumers opt for crumble and sponge National Archives to trial 12-document limit per day for visitors, as academics warn research could be affectedPond scum could feed the world if used as a protein substitute for meat and eggs in meals, says Cambridge University professorComment: Only a union of Unionists can defeat the rampaging SNPComment: Harvey Weinstein is the poster child for our age of cynical victimhoodComment: Rebecca Long Bailey is the worst choice Labour could make.

Yet even with an awareness of that hyperbole, 2020 will be an epic year for American politics. It begins with Donald Trump facing a trial in the Senate over whether to be removed from office – an indignity only two other US presidents have faced. By the year\u0027s end we will know if this disruptive, unprecedented leader has been given another four years in charge.In between we will see a battle between Democrats to win their party\u0027s nomination to take on Mr Trump, with history again there for the making. Among the candidates are those hoping to become America’s first female president and first openly gay president, not to mention both the oldest and youngest person ever voted into the Oval Office.To keep British readers in the know, The  is launching a weekly newsletter all about the 2020 election race. It will drop into inboxes every Thursday morning and be written by myself and my colleagues in the Washington DC office, Nick Allen and Rozina Sabur. The idea is to provide readers with analysis and updates from the campaign trail,  sharp enough to bring real insight but short enough not to feel like a chore to read. There will be a main piece of analysis on the big issue at the time, something on a key moment you may have missed, recommended reading from the US political scene, the latest polling movements, summaries of other developments, plus much more. It promises to be a wild ride. Voting for the Democratic nomination begins in February. The party conventions happen in the summer, crowing the candidates. Autumn brings the presidential debates and intense campaigning, plus who knows what else before the November 3 election. We will be out on the road throughout, talking to voters and feeling the pulse in battleground states . Does this sound like your bag? If so, please do sign up to the newsletter, US 2020, by clicking below. Expert insight and exclusive analysis on the 2020 election, written by our US team.Death of the Christmas pudding as consumers opt for crumble and sponge National Archives to trial 12-document limit per day for visitors, as academics warn research could be affectedBritain \u0026#39not doing enough\u0026#39 to help its nationals detained in Iran as French-Iranian has charge droppedPond scum could feed the world if used as a protein substitute for meat and eggs in meals, says Cambridge University professorComment: Only a union of Unionists can defeat the rampaging SNPComment: Harvey Weinstein is the poster child for our age of cynical victimhoodComment: Rebecca Long Bailey is the worst choice Labour could make.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Earth, oxygen is created when living organisms convert sunlight into chemical energy – and scientists think the same might happen on Earth.Now scientists hope that the new technique could allow them to spot the same signal coming from other planets, and in so doing perhaps spot planets that might be home to alien life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

As they do, they block out a specific part of the infrared spectrum, and the new telescope will be able to see that and give scientists a clue to the distant worlds\u0027 atmosphere.Technology like the James Webb Space Telescope is the best hope for examining such distant planets, since they are too far away to ever visit or even to see in much detail, but it requires incredible advanced technology because of the weakness of the signals.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsBefore our work, oxygen at similar levels as on Earth was thought to be undetectable with Webb,\u0026nbspThomas\u0026nbspFauchez, from NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspand lead author of the study, said in a statement.This oxygen signal is known since the early\u0026nbsp1980s\u0026nbspfrom Earth\u0027s atmospheric studies but has never been studied for exoplanet research.Spotting oxygen on a planet might not be a guarantee that something lives there. Scientists have proposed alternative explanations that could create oxygen on exoplanets, and so it might not be a definitive indication that the world is alive.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This revision took it above November’s reading of 49.3.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Any improvement in the sector’s fortune is of course welcome, but this small improvement to the ‘no change’ mark means stagnation is also a possibility,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), which\u0026nbsppublished the report.“Other clouds of uncertainty must also include the potential for further political instability as negotiators and policymakers take the next steps.”Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The survey’s finding did offer hope for stronger output in 2020. The forward-looking business expectations index was the highest since September 2018.“The modest rebound in new work provides another signal that business conditions should begin to improve in the coming months, helped by a boost to business sentiment from greater Brexit clarity and a more predictable political landscape,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.Economists said that investors would now be looking for confirmation of a post-election boost in data to be published this month. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said markets would be looking at the “flash” estimates of output from the construction manufacturing and services sector on 17 January to see whether it might stop the Bank of England from cutting interest rates.Top FTSE 100 bosses will earn more than average worker by 5pm today“If this post-election bounce is repeated in other data … then it will probably be enough to prevent more Monetary Policy Committee members from voting for a rate cut,” Mr Pugh said. “But if there isn’t an uplift in the data over the next few months, then the MPC may step in to support the economy.”However, any upturn comes against an anaemic background. The seasonally adjusted composite index of all sectors registered 49.3 in December, unchanged from that seen in November and\u0026nbspthe joint-lowest since July 2016.The stabilisation of service sector activity in Monday’s figures was offset by a sharp and accelerated decline in manufacturing output to 45.6.Economists are not expecting a cut in governor Mark Carney’s final meeting\u0026nbspthis month, with the financial markets only pricing in a 10 per cent chance of a move. However, the odds of a rate move by August rise to evens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is because they are treated favourably and have more privileges,” the Ofsted report said. “Some of the girls told us that they do not like this. They said that this was not fair and feel disadvantaged.”Inspectors visited the school in November and concluded its unlawful segregation of pupils by sex is having a “negative impact” on girls’ education and self-confidence.It comes after the Court of Appeal concluded in 2017 that an Islamic faith school’s policy of segregating boys from girls was unlawful sex discrimination.Ofsted had placed the mixed-sex Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham into special measures in 2016 after it claimed iding classes was discriminatory.Saadat Rasool, headteacher of\u0026nbspRedstone\u0026nbspAcademy, has said it has no intention of defying the law in any way.He said: “We believe the idea that boys are ‘given favourable treatment and more opportunities than girls’ is just not accurate as all the previous Ofsted reports have noted that provision for boys and girls has been equal and fair.“We work very diligently to offer the best to both boys and girls at our school – and both are given equal opportunities to be successful in whatever they choose.”​Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

Over that time they have detected hundreds of signals, though pinpointed very few.The search is difficult in part because they last for just miliseconds and could come from anywhere in the sky, making detailed examination of them incredibly difficult.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Now they have managed to locate another, in a nearby galaxy, taking the total to five.But they are perhaps more excited about the nature of the galaxy that is sending them out. It appears to be similar to our own, they say.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Identifying the host galaxy for\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbspis critical to tell us about what kind of environments\u0026nbspFRBs\u0026nbsplive in, and thus what might actually be producing\u0026nbspFRBs, said Sarah\u0026nbspBurke-Spolaor, assistant professor of physics and astronomy and co-author on a new paper in Nature.This is a question for which scientists are still grasping at straws.That discovery adds further mystery to the question of where FRBs are coming from. The first of the blasts came from a tiny galaxy made up of metals and newly formed stars, which led scientists to suggest they might be the result of the kind of stars found there – but that would not apply to the newly found galaxy.That means astronomers will have to consider other explanations of how FRBs\u0026nbspare generated, and might suggest there are multiple origins.The newly discovered source, named FRB ​180916,\u0026nbspis only half-a-billion light years from Earth and much nearer than other bursts that have been found in the past. It is seven times closer than the only other repeating burst that has been tracked down.That could allow for further study of the burst that could give further clues about where the bursts are coming from, scientists said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has previously rejected criticisms levelled at him of being too middle-class for the role and recalled how his mother worked as a nurse while his father was employed as a factory toolmaker.\u0026nbsp“The idea that somehow I personally don’t know what it’s like for people across the country in all sorts of different circumstances is just not borne out,” he told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme after the general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir draws supporters from across the party and is said to have already convinced enough MPs to back his leadership ambitions. Aware of Labour’s left-leaning membership, who will ultimately decide the next leader, he has been careful not abandon Jeremy Corbyn’s radical policies.\u0026nbsp“What Jeremy Corbyn brought to the Labour Party in 2015 was a change in emphasis - a radicalism that matters, and the rejection of austerity. We need to build on that, rather than oversteer and go back to some bygone age,” he said in December.“The case for a radical government has never been stronger. The shift to a more radical position in 2015 and that rejection of austerity was really important.”He was also a prominent supporter in the shadow cabinet of Labour shifting to back to a pro-Final Say referendum. According to a recent poll of the party’s membership by YouGov, Sir Keir enjoys 31 per cent of first preferences support – 11 per cent ahead his closest rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailThe Salford and Eccles MP entered the race to succeed Mr Corbyn with an article for the left-wing Tribune magazine, vowing to build a “winning vision of a socialist future” and to “go to war with the political establishment”.Ms Long Bailey has repeatedly highlighted her childhood experience of growing up in the shadow of Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium and watching her father worry about job losses as a docker and trade union representative. She worked as a solicitor in her twenties and was a relative newcomer into Labour politics before being elected in 2015 to replace Hazel Blears.\u0026nbsp Considered a protégé of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, she quickly climbed the ranks of Corbyn’s Labour Party before becoming the shadow business secretary in 2017.Since announcing her leadership bid Ms Long Bailey has been described as a “continuity Corbyn” candidate – a label she rejects – after making clear she will stick with Labour’s radical agenda, especially the Green New Deal she claims party strategists “tragically undersold”.\u0026nbsp“I don’t just agree with the policies, I’ve spent the last four years writing them,” she added.Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Long Bailey also insisted she would not return to Ed Miliband era of “controls on immigration” being showcased on the side of the Labour Party mugs, adding claims that immigration depresses wages are wrong.\u0026nbspOn Trident, the nuclear deterrent system, which Mr Corbyn refused to say he would use, she said: “If you have a deterrent you have to be prepared to use it.”Ms Long Bailey is widely considered to be one of the top two candidates to succeed Mr Corbyn in April and has already attracted the prominent backing of Ian Lavery. the party chairman who had been mulling his own leadership bid, and that of her close friend Angela Rayner, who is also running for the deputy leadership position. Whether the left-leaning members are enticed by Sir Keir or another left-wing candidate, such as Clive Lewis, however, remains to be seen.\u0026nbspOne of the first contenders to enter the leadership race in the aftermath of the disastrous general election campaign, Clive Lewis said: “I’m standing to leader of the Labour Party for the simple reason that if I don’t, certain necessary truths may go unspoken during the debates of the coming months”.\u0026nbspBefore joining Labour’s parliamentary ranks, Mr Lewis grew up in a council estate in Northampton with his English mother and father, who came to the UK from Grenada, and worked in a good processing factory before becoming a full-time trade union official. Mr Lewis eventually worked as a BBC journalist, and an army reservist, who served in Afghanistan.\u0026nbspIn a recent article for The Independent, Mr Lewis wrote: “My Granddad instilled in me a great sense of civic duty through his stories of fighting the Nazis during the war. He also fostered a sense of black pride and struggle in me, as he taught me about colonial history.\u0026nbsp“My sense of belonging didn’t come from some idealised construct of the past but was created in the present, through the everyday experiences of the people I grew up with. This sense of belonging based on shared values and interests is what I want to bring to our country now.”So far in the contest, Mr Lewis, who was one of the most prominent backers of a second referendum, has backed a shift to proportional representation voting system, reform of the House of Lords and suggested that Labour should “reach out to every progressive force in the country – parties, campaigns and movements – for the biggest conversation possible about how, together, we can change our country for the better”.But given a sizeable proportion of the left-wing MPs’ votes are likely to head in Ms Long Bailey’s direction, it is not yet clear whether Mr Lewis, the shadow treasury minister, will have sufficient support in the Parliamentary Labour Party to make it through to the second round.Announcing her decision to run for Labour leader Emily Thornberry made clear she had been an opponent of an early general election, and warned Jeremy Corbyn’s office it had been an “act of catastrophic political folly”.She was brought up on a council estate near Guildford in Surrey by her mother when her father, a human rights lawyer and academic, walked out on his family. “I was born into the Labour Party,” she once said, claiming she delivered leaflets by the “age I could reach the letter box”. Before being elected as the MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005, Ms Thornberry also studied law at Kent University and went on to become a human rights barrister.Ms Thornberry has been loyal to Mr Corbyn – a constituency neighbour – throughout his leadership but, like Sir Keir, was sidelined during the campaign for her vocal support of a second Brexit referendum – and once even dressed up as an EU flag. She has also won plaudits for her performance at the despatch box as shadow foreign secretary and has previously stood in for the Labour leader at prime minister’s questions.On policy, she has previously said there was “nothing” in the manifesto she disagreed with, but rather: “When you put it all together, it did look like we were promising to deliver the earth, the moon and stars”. In recent days, she also attacked Boris Johnson, her former opposite number in the House of Commons, over the Iranian crisis in the aftermath of the killing of Qassem Soleimani.\u0026nbspShe accused the prime minister of “sunning himself, drinking vodka martinis” in the Caribbean instead of dealing with the fallout from the death of the Iranian official.\u0026nbsp She also warned of a “lurch towards war” because of Donald’s Trump’s “reckless decision” to kill one of the most prominent figures in the Iranian regime.It is not yet clear with Ms Thornberry has the required support from Labour MPs to pass through to the next round of the contest. According to polling by YoGov, she also finishes in the bottom two, alongside Lisa Nandy, in terms of Labour members’ first preferences for the next leader of the party.Entering the leadership contest, Jess Phillips declared that politics “needs an honest voice” as she launched a campaign video detailing her community activism in Birmingham over a decade ago.“People want some fairy basic things,” she declared. “They won’t to know that their children can be educated and if they are ill that they will be made better. Those things are radical to great parts of our country at the moment because they simply don’t exist.”Before being elected to parliament in 2015 she worked in women’s refugees, helping victims of domestic abuse, and has since read out the names of those killed by their partners each year in the House of Commons. In an interview with The Sunday Times over the summer, Ms Phillips said she was brought up in a working-class community in Birmingham as her “bearded lefty” father worked as a teacher and healthcare manager.\u0026nbspDuring one recent speech to MPs, she said: “I thought I had met posh people before I came here, but I had actually just met people who eat olives”.Perhaps the most prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party, Ms Phillips has become a high-profile figure in the Labour Party, despite not serving on the frontbench. She has also been vocal of the party’s “woeful response” to antisemitism allegations within its ranks.\u0026nbspShe has been a supporter of a second referendum, but appeared to row back on her suggestion at the weekend that the party could campaign to rejoin the EU under her stewardship if the Brexit proved damaging. \u0026nbspMs Phillips is likely to draw her support in the Parliamentary Labour Party from those who have been critical of Mr Corbyn’s leadership and more moderate-leaning MPs. But given the left-wing persuasion of the party’s membership she faces a monumental challenge if she is to emerge as the next Labour leader in April.The Wigan MP since 2010 officially entered the race several days into the new year, and warned party members that if the party fails to change course “we will become irrelevant”.Launching her campaign in the Wigan Post, she said that without “what were once our Labour heartlands” Labour will never win back power in Westminster.Ms Nandy and former shadow cabinet minister launched the Centre For Towns think tank - something which could give her an advantage in understanding why voters in former industrial Labour heartlands switched to the Tories. She said that too many people no longer feel they have a voice in our national story and did not believe that politicians were interested in what they had to say.Before being elected in 2010, Ms Nandy worked for the youth homelessness charity Centrepoint and The Children\u0027s Society. She grew up in a highly political household: her Indian father, Dipak Nandy, was a Marxist academic, and her grandfather Frank Byers served the Liberal Party in the House of Commons before becoming a life peer. She studied politics at Newcastle University and became a councillor before running for parliament.\u0026nbspMs Nandy, who is often described to be from the “soft left” in the Labour Party, said “trust” was the key issue in why Labour lost the election. Hinting she will stick with key policies of Labour’s manifesto, she said “people felt it was a no-brainer” when talking about the renationalisation of the railways.\u0026nbspBut she added: “When we said that we would offer free broadband, I remember somebody in Leigh saying, “I just want a functioning bus network.”She insisted it was “looking very positive” in regards to getting on the ballot paper during an interview at the weekend, but appears at the bottom of members’ first preferences for the next leader in a recent poll.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef. It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

The nurses were around her.“She [Thornberry] had her left hand up in the air and they quite quickly put it in a sling for her.“We were there for over two hours in total. It felt aswe weren’t as important.“I was there with someone struggling quite badly to breathe, they in a lot of distress.“We were still sat there at that time she left - although we’d been there half an hour before she arrived.“We were in a queue system so we were very concerned and frustrated.”Patients attending AE departments register and are normally pre-assessed by a nurse or doctor - known as triage.This is meant to ensure that those with the most serious conditions are seen first.Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury - a short distance from the hospital.Previously seen as an ally of Jeremy Corbyn she has said she will stand to replace him as Labour leader.A spokesman for Thornberry said: “Like everyone  at AE that day she waited to be seen for her badly-cut and bleeding hand for more than an hour.“At no stage did any member of staff in the waiting room acknowledge her or treat her dferently.“Emily is sorry that another patient and their friend had a bad experience waiting for treatment, but that had nothing to do with her.”Figures reveal that between July and September last year  per cent of AE patients at UCLH were treated, discharged or admitted within the four- hour target. The national target is  per cent.A UCLH spokesman said: “Patients in our emergency department are seen and treated according to their clinical needs.

Two days before the flight, she sent him a message…”In , authorities first investigated a mystery woman who made a two-minute phone call to the captain of MH, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, shortly before the plane’s take-off, using a pay-as-you-go SIM card that was obtained under a  identity.It was one of the last calls made to or from the Captain’s mobile in the hours before his Boeing  left Kuala Lumpur.In Malaysia, anyone purchasing a PAYG SIM must fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number, under anti-terror measured brought in after the September  Twin Tower attacks.The mobile number was traced to a shop in Kuala Lumpur, and efforts were made to track down the woman who made the call.Authorities feared the phone call was a possible link between Captain Zaharie and terror groups whose members routinely use untraceable SIM cards.It is not yet clearthe two women are the same person or at all linked.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Almost six years after the MH aircraft went missing, the new investigative documentary promises to deliver new compelling evidence – including what the authorities in Australia and Malaysia really knew about the disappearance, and exactly where experts believe the plane’s wreckage can be found.Sky News Australia journalist Peter Stefanovic says Malaysian authorities knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing, but covered it up.Stefanovic said: “I will reveal the Malaysian government knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing – but continued to look in the wrong areas.”“I will also reveal private conversations held between very senior members of the Australian and Malaysian governments.”In the documentary preview, Stefanovic puts the accusations directly to former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.Malaysian Airlines Boeing  aircraft was carrying  passengers and crew when it vanished in the early hours of March , , while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.The world was left baffled: how could a modern aircraft simply vanish Almost six years on, MH has become the greatest aviation mystery of all time, with the search for the missing jet becoming the most costly in aviation history.Despite hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities the plane has never been found, sparking anger in the missing passengers’ desperate families.Until now, the most likely scenario explaining the aircraft’s disappearance involved someone in the cockpit of Flight , probably Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, re-programming the aircrafts autopilot to travel south across the Indian Ocean in an act of murder-suicide.It is hoped Sky News Australia’s MH: The Untold Story will spark a reopening of the search for the missing aircraft and the passengers on board to finally answer: What really happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight MH "},{"url":null,"title":"school 27 pupils return as teachers","story":"They make up almost half the staff, including the headteacher and deputy.Ex-pupil Rhian Morgan Ellis, , has been head for the past ten years at Ysgol Cwm Rhondda in Porth, South Wales.Rhian, who has taught there for  years, said: “Once you’re here it grabs you.”One of her newest recruits is learning support assistant Amelia Davies, .She left only two years ago and said: “It’s like we’re a big family.Music teacher Amy Morgan, , started her career at the -strong school.She added: “Music was my favourite lesson.

Which will it be  The acidic lime-barrel, the chewy coconut caramel or the tooth-shattering walnut swirl Labour Party members face that sort of dilemma this week.The contest to be their next leader will begin properly today when MPsto Westminster. Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That they’re “in no position to lecture the public about anything”. That they “know nothing about the real world”.Ordinary people ARE sick of these ill-informed egomaniacs. That’s why celebrity endorsements never help Labour here — or the Democrats in the US.We doubt that any of these Golden Globetrotters will have the self-awareness or humility to wind their necks in.But we’re proud that as millions watched, cheering, a plain-talking Brit burst the celebs’ bubble.Every word was bang on their money.WE have our fingers crossed for the Cyprus gang-rape teenager as she learns her fate today.She may yet be freed with a presidential pardon.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Bill, nicknamed the aposWABapos is being rushed through the House of Commons in three days this week to ensure the UK can leave the EU legally by January . But since October itaposs had major changes - including stripping out previous commitments to workers’ rights and forcing the transition period to end on December . That could leave the UK facing a no-deal Brexit on  January there is no trade deal with the EU in time.  The RPC warned those changes - and its own warnings that more assessment was needed - have been ignored. And it said the assessment is “not at the level we would expect to see.” A statement by the RPC said: “The Government have not revised the October IA to reflect either the comments in our October opinion or the changes made to the Bill at its re-introduction to Parliament in December. “Our opinion, therefore, remains that the quality of evidence in the IA is not at the level that we would expect to see in a final stage IA. Shown the statement by the Mirror, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Alistair Carmichael saisd: At every step of the way, the Tories have tried to disguise the damaging and dangerous consequences of their Brexit plans.The Government must stop running away from the  promises that they have made and be honest with the public about what they have in store for them with their hard Brexit plan. This statement from the independent Regulatory Policy Committee demonstrates that the Government has repeatedly refused to provide accurate information, especially on the impact on small businesses, leaving people in the dark. Itaposs about time that Boris Johnson started being honest with our people, rather than hiding the true price of a hard Brexit. What do they have to hide ”Any criticism of the Bill would have been academic in legal terms because Boris Johnson has an -seat majority.That means concerns about workersapos rights and the trapdoor to no-deal Brexit are unlikely to be written out of the law.  The October impact assessment said the Bill would cost a relatively tiny £m over  years - but most costs or impacts were not included. It didnapost count either the £bn orce bill, or the end of billions in payments to Brussels. Not to mention £bn in no-deal planning.Yet at the time, Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to bow to calls for a proper impact assessment.He said: Trust in democracy and bringing an end to the ision that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments.

When the exit poll was announced it was devastating. We had let down millions of people across the country who desperately need a Labour Government. Time after time I have said we need to learn the lessons from election defeats - and Iaposm fed up saying it. The Labour Party must change so that people across the country can trust us once again. I’m standing to be deputy leader of the Labour Party because I want to help us win power to transform lives. That’s why I joined the Labour party: to change our country. Growing up on the Wester Hailes council estate in Edinburgh, in a family that worked as coopers and slaughtermen, I was taught to be three things: a patriotic Scot a passionate Hearts football club fan and a defender of the Labour movement. It’s a combination that has brought unbridled joy and uncontrollable tears in equal measure over the years. When my dad died suddenly at the age of  I was just nine-years-old. My mum was left with two young boys to look after, and I don’t think I ever appreciated how hard she worked to keep us afloat. To the Tory Government of the day, families like ours didn’t deserve support. But my mum and my teachers told me and my brother there was nothing we couldn’t achieve. I want that hope and aspiration for every child. That’s what the Labour Party can deliver when it’s in power. But today we are on the opposition benches in the Commons, in danger of drting into irrelevance. We need ambition, strength and couragewe are to stand a chance of survival. I know what it takes to beat the odds.  I worked as a kitchen porter and went on to run my own pubs. I grew up on a council estate and went to Edinburgh University at the age of  as the first in my family to go to university. I helped rescue my beloved football club from extinction by leading the fans’ foundation. And in politics I have defended my seat against a wave of populist nationalism that swept away all my Labour colleagues in Scotland… twice. I know how to win by building broad coalitions of support from all parties and none. To win again, we will need to beat the odds, and they are stacked against us. But we can change themwe make the right choices and be honest with ourselves and the public. The architects of the party’s catastrophic failure in  cannot be allowed to be the architects of the response. The next leadership team must turn us into an election-winning machine that uses the skills and talents of all our members and supporters to succeed. There are four ways I want to see us do that. Firstly, we must listen to and reconnect with voters in the seats we lost, as well as those who abandoned us in the seats we hold. We must also listen to those in seats we will never win and build our response from there. With Scotland’s voice at the top of the party we can send a strong message that we are listening to all the nations and regions that want to be heard, and that the entire party can learn from Scotland where populist nationalism had its first victory in the UK. Second, we must be clear about where we stand on the key issues of the day. Voters don’t want politicians to agree with them all the time – they want us to have the debate and try to convince them. On the major constitutional issues of our time – Scottish independence and Brexit – we must be clear with people where we stand. We should always be a pro-EU and pro-UK party because it is not just in the national interest, but part of our values. We must show leadership and strength to make and win those arguments. Third, we must reform our organisation. As deputy leader I would launch a review of our organisation – working alongside members and party staff – to understand the mistakes that were made and how we can fix them for the future. The current party organisation should not be changed until the new leadership team is in place. Finally, we need an open and inclusive policy process to lead us to Labour’s next manesto. I believe Labour can win again, but we will only turn this roundwe don’t dwell on the past and instead look to the future. Big questions need a Labour response - how do we govern ourselveswe are to have a post-Brexit Britain  What does the future of work look like with automation, disruptive technologies, and articial intelligence  "},{"url":null,"title":"number 10 asked is boris","story":"NewsNumber  asked Is Boris Johnson OK  - after PM not seen in public for  daysAt a time of growing international crisis, the last time the Prime Minister was seen in public was when he jetted off for his lavish Caribbean holidayShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe last time Boris Johnson was seen in public was when he landed in St Lucia in December  \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

He was last spotted in the Caribbean at St Lucia airport on December  as he stopped off with girlfriend Carrie Symonds on their way to their £,-a-week paradise bolt hole on the private island of Mustique.Mr Johnson has held a series of phone calls with world leaders, including US President Donald Trump , French premier Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel since ing to No on Sunday.He hosted Cabinet in Downing Street this morning.

Runners and riders have been jostling to make their vision heard as they prepare to face off in a contest that will define the future of the Labour Party. Who wins will be defined by Labouraposs ,-ish members - many of whom flocked into the party after  to support Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing agenda. Long time ally Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as the aposcontinuityapos candidate to carry Mr Corbynaposs torch - but some in the party fear she wonapost make enough of a splash and want party chair Ian Lavery instead. Remainers Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer have declared their intentions while Wiganaposs Lisa Nandy, a backbencher who warned for years that Labour could lose northern heartlands over Brexit, is also in the frame. A new leader will be in place on April . Here are all the candidates and potential candidates so far. The new leader will be announced on Saturday  April after a three-month contest to pick the next Labour chief. Candidates will have until Monday next week to gain the support of  MPs or MEPs - plus either % of constituency parties or % of affiliates . Those who get onto the ballot paper will then face a vote by full members, union affiliates and registered supporters. Members and union affiliates will have until pm on Monday  January to sign up for a ballot. Or people can sign up for a one-off vote as a registered supporter for £. To do this they have just a -hour window to sign up for a vote in the leadership race - between pm next Tuesday and pm next Thursday. The rule is the same one that was used in , when more than , registered supporters applied in two days.

Runners, riders and betting odds Declared they will definitely run Ladbrokes, January  KEIR STARMER,  -   Holborn  St Pancras  PROFILE: The favourite in internal polls of Labour party members - and is popular among the broader public with Tories privately admitting they’d rather he didn’t get the job. While the shadow Brexit Secretary’s Remain inclinations will no longer be a problem, being a North London man might be. He’s not a union man, but has their respect, and has an impressive CV as he was Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP in . His seriousness and intellect help at the despatch box, but he could do with sometimes showing his lighter side. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He warned the party must not oversteer back to the centre. He said: The case for a radical Labour government has never been stronger”. And he called for the party to take on the narrative that Boris Johnson can aposget Brexit doneapos by the end of January.  REBECCA LONG-BAILEY,  -   Salford  Eccles  PROFILE: John McDonnell’s and other Corbyn alliesapos preferred successor for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor has been grooming her for the top job. The shadow business secretary’s quiet demeanour belies a fiery passion for addressing social justice. Laura Pidcock’s failure to win a seat has cleared the way for her to be the candidate of the Left. She says sheaposs seriously considering running for the leadership - and will back flatmate Angela Rayner for the deputy leadershipshe runs. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: The MP confirmed her run with an unapologetic praising of Jeremy Corbynaposs policies - which she helped write. Defending Jeremy Corbyn’s legacy, she wrote in the : “Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards. We didn’t lose because of our commitments to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees.” However, in comments which will be seen as an attempt to dferentiate herself from the Labour leader, she also wrote: From ex-miners in Blythe Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities. Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working le, built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared le of everyone. To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain.  LISA NANDY,  -   Wigan  PROFILE: The eloquent backbencher was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Her links with powerful Union unite could help any run. Has hinted at a joint bid with David Lammy. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She argued Labour is facing the last chance to save itself as a whole, not from warring factions, and win back older and working-class voters. Itaposs about whether that traditional coalition that has propelled us into power three times in the last  years can hold good, and whether we can speak for both Lewisham and Leigh.  JESS PHILLIPS,  -   Birmingham Yardley  PROFILE: The powerful voice is one of Labour’s strongest media performers who has the ability to speak “human” and the ability to tack between funny quips and powerful speeches. She is the chair of Labour’s women’s PLP and has been a strong supporter of all-women shortlists - perhaps suggesting she could push for them to be extended to the leadership race. But as she admitted herself on election night, the leadership race is “more than just a personality game and I know that people like me because I have a personality, and that will never just be enough.” WHAT SHEaposS SAID: “Now is not the time to play it safe. What I’ve heard so far in this debate is totally inadequate to the scale of the problem. Voters have changed, the electoral map has been transformed, communication in a social media age is dferent. We need to recognise that politics has changed in a fundamental way by electing a dferent kind of leader. More of the same will lead to more of the same result.”  CLIVE LEWIS,  -   Norwich South   PROFILE: A former BBC correspondent Mr Lewis has straddled the ide in the Labour party between Corbynistas and more moderate MPs. He resigned as shadow Defence Secretary after attempts by Mr Corbyn’s office to water down the party’s support for Trident. But the Norwich South MP has also been a vocal supporter of many of the soon to be ex-Labour leader’s policies. Despite being a confident media performer, his profile has been diminished since he left the Shadow Cabinet. And his compromise position means he hasn’t endeared himself to loyalists on either side of the party’s left right ide - meaning he may struggle to pick up support. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He called for the party membership to be given more powers than they were under Corbyn, backed proportional representation and said Labouraposs indecisiveness over Brexit hurt them. In contrast with most current analysis he suggested that the party had still not gone far enough to break with the Blair and Brown era.  EMILY THORNBERRY,  -   Islington South  Finsbury  PROFILE: An impressive performer - both in front of crowds and on the media. The shadow foreign secretary is a quick thinker, belly-laugh funny and has experience of going up against Boris Johnson at the despatch box. But she quit the frontbench in  after being accused of snobbery by tweeting a picture of a house decked out in St George’s flags, with a white van parked outside. And there are concerns another leader from Islington might not be the answer Labour is looking for. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She stood by her decision to back a second Brexit referendum, saying Jeremy Corbyn was let down and badly advised by top aides. She also called for the New Year Honours to extend to the dead and said she will promise to quit as leader before an electionthe polls and opinion show she canapost win.  Tipped to run DAN JARVIS,  -   Barnsley Central  PROFILE: The state-educated son of a lecturer and probation officer went to Sandhurst and served in the Parachute Regiment in Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, rising to the rank of Major. He resigned from the Army to fight and win a by-election in . Despite being tipped for stardom in the days of Ed Miliband, heaposs had a very low profile under Jeremy Corbyn - even though he is juggling two elected offices, as MP and Mayor for the Sheffield City region. Ruled themselves out YVETTE COOPER,  Pontefract  Castleford  PROFILE: Yvette Cooper saw her odds slashed from   to   after she said she was considering throwing her hat into the ring. She is seen as a competent politician having chaired the Home Affairs Select Committee and with respect from MPs from the parliament. But four years ago she lost to Jeremy Corbyn . The former Cabinet minister who came second in the contest in  winning % of the vote compared to Mr Corbynaposs % said she would decide over Christmas whether to enter the race. Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She said both the left and right of the party are seen as internationalist rather than patriotic and Labour mustto its support in towns and former heartlands, not just the erse young fast-moving cities in England. However the Mirror reported she was unlikely to run after taking soundings from colleagues.  IAN LAVERY,  Wansbeck  PROFILE: A bruiser who began his career at Northumberland’s Lynemouth Colliery, Ian Lavery was thrown into politics by the s Miners’ Strike. The -year-old succeeded Arthur Scargill as National Union of Mineworkers President in  before becoming an MP in . The Jeremy Corbyn loyalist, whose region backed Leave by % to %, was one of the few Shadow Cabinet ministers to adamantly back Brexit after the  referendum. That led to clashes between the father-of-two, a football, cricket and boxing fan, and top MPs who wanted to Remain. Despite being Labour’s joint elections co-ordinator since , Mr Lavery very nearly paid a heavy personal price over Brexit. His , majority in Wansbeck was slashed to  in the general election as a ‘red wall’ of Labour heartlands turned blue.Mr Lavery was previously dogged by press coverage about £, he received from a union he ran, which by  had only  recorded members. The money included just under £, in termination payments”, when Mr Lavery was made redundant as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area on becoming an MP in May . Mr Lavery has always vehemently denied wrongdoing, either by himself or the union, and the Certication Office for trade unions decided not to investigate further in an October  report. WHAT HEaposS SAID: Talk of a second referendum was seen by many as a way to foist Remain upon them. Communities represented by Labour for generations felt abandoned. It is time to outline a positive vision of the future outside of the EU. Divided parties can’t win. Let’s get back to debating in a forthright but respectful way, remembering what we have in common and stop reinforcing press attacks on our own party. ANGELA RAYNER,  Ashton-under-Lyne  Long tipped for the top job, her back story of rising to the top of politics despite leaving school after getting pregnant at  is inspirational. She later trained as a care worker and eventually became a trade union representative with Unison, who would be likely to back her for the top job. The shadow education secretary has become an increasingly polished performer, but Labour insiders claim that she is still a work in progress. But sheaposs going for the deputy leadership instead.

One caravan owner at Hardwick Parks, in Oxfordshire, said the site is being emptied of holiday homes because any that are older than  years must be removed. And, in a further blow, those being made to leave must pay a £ removal fee. The owner, who wishes to be anonymous, toldthat despite the new rules and escalating maintenance fees, the actual site has had little investment. They said: Each year the rules get stricter meaning greater expense whilst the site continues to deteriorate. Have you been affected by the new rules  Email webnews@mirror I have asked management what the plans are for the site but told nothing. This is a family site with a big community and it is being ripped apart by the new rules. The site now has approximately  caravans left meaning what was a beautul holiday home site now looks like a rubbish dump. My caravan is surrounded by a mudbath.  According to the caravan owner, families began to quit when the age rules came in for the holiday parks. We have been told that all caravans over  years old, with immaculate interiors and gardens, must be removed, despite owners investing thousands over recent years on their gardens and caravans, they said. This has been a holiday home for generations of families. Some families have had caravans on this site for more than  years. A spokesperson for Hardwick Parks said its age policy is standard industry practice and the company are more generous than most other caravan parks.  Annual fees for caravan owners start from £, but according to the owner they have seen little investment on the site for their money. They said: Each year the rules get stricter meaning greater expense whilst the site continues to deteriorate. We have been asked to carry out gas checks annually and check the electrics every three years. But Hardwick Parks say gas and electric certicates are good health and safety practice for the benefit of all customers on park, particularly given the age of some of the caravans still sited. The company also denies that there has been little investment. The caravan owner continued: We are also told we must use the holiday parkaposs approved contractors to carry out the checks.  Luckily I asked for permission to use my own contractor and it was allowed to but some caravan owners are too scared to ask. Hardwick Parks disputed the claim saying owners can use who they like for their safety checks, providing they are accredited. Pot holes and lack of street lighting make it dangerous yet fees remain upwards of £, for a seven month season plus an additional £ to launch a boat,the caravan owner said. The caravan owner says she fears for the siteaposs future claiming the siteaposs owners are refusing to reveal what their long-term plan is.

A huge mass of earth and sand the size of “a couple of football pitches” plunged onto the beach overnight. Police and the council are now warning walkers to stay away from the area, which is dangerously unstable. Tony Garbutt, operations manager at HM Coastguard, said: We are looking at a good half acre falling, about the size of a couple of football pitches. “Some of the caravans are very close to the edge. Weaposve disconnected the utilities and weaposre pulling the caravans that were closest to the edge back. This coast is unstable and weaposre not going to be able to stop that. The beach below the clf has been blocked with areas of rubble measuring m high. Mr Garbutt added: It becomes a bit like quicksand and people can get stuck.”  Pete Revell, rescue officer from the local Coastguard, revealed a smaller section of clf collapsed nearby following heavy rain in December. He added: I thought it was big last time, but this is about three times as big. It has gone right into the sea. We donapost want anyone going near the beach at all.  The collapse happened at Trimingham House Caravan Park near Mundesley, Norfolk, overnight between Sunday and Monday. No one was hurt but a woman living in one of the affected caravans has been evacuated. She is understood to be living with relatives. The Norfolk and Suffolk coastline is among the UKs fastest eroding, with many areas losing an average of m of land annually.

But while she got bigger, her twin sister Jodi stayed a size   from teenhood. They always thought of me as ‘the big one’ and I hated that. I wished they were thinking ‘she’s the thin one’ about me and not my twin, Ky, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said today. “I was at my boyfriend’s house when his dad took a picture but didn’t show it to me. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks later when we were going through his phone looking for a dferent photo that I saw it and couldn’t believe it. “All I could think was how tight the top I was wearing looked. I hardly recognised myself, it just really shocked me to see myself the size I was. “That was when I thought, something’s got to change. This time next year I’m not going to look like that.” So the retail assistant joined Slimming World and, in the  months since, has lost five stone. Now she weighs a trim st lb, sheaposs a slender size  and eats healthier.  Ky added: Before I stuck to baggy clothes and it used to get me down that I couldn’t wear all the nice things that everyone  seemed to be wearing. “My sister could always wear the clothes I wanted to wear which really upset me and it definitely affected my confidence. Now I’m always buying clothes and taking photos of myself to post on social media and lots of people don’t recognise me anymore. “When they see me, and how much weight I’ve lost, it’s such a shock to them. And having spent most of my le being the fatter twin, I’m actually the thinner one at last.  But she concedes her lestyle was hugely dferent when she piled on the pounds. I was just eating all the wrong things and I just didn’t know when to stop. I’d have a meal in the evening with my sister and mum and then carry on eating afterwards. I’d think, I’ll just have one or two biscuits, but the whole pack would be gone by the end of the night, Ky continued. Jodi has never struggled with her weight, so my mum would buy chocolates and sweets for her but then hide them in the house to keep them away from me. She was trying to help me be more healthy, but I’d always search the top of the cupboards and manage to find them, no matter where she’d put them.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple claim the surrogate who agreed to give birth to their babies for them to complete their dream family has refused to hand over the twins. Steven and March Winchester-Horscraft, of Baschurch, Shropshire, say the surrogate tried to keep the premature babies - claiming her boyfriend was the father. The couple, both nurses, are crowdfunding for help with their massive legal bill after they were forced to take the battle for their daughters to court despite already paying their surrogate £,. The pair already have a son to a previous surrogate, and befriended the new one -even inviting her and her boyfriend to their wedding. She became pregnant and the couple were overjoyed to learn they were expecting twin girls in April. But according to a GoFundMe page launched by the pair yesterday, entitled our surrogacy nightmare, their excitement soon turned to drama as the arrangement turned sour. Steven, who is the biological father, wrote how the couple had always longed to have a family, and had their son in  via their first surrogate, which went  smoothly.  After their little boy began asking for a sibling, they decided they were ready to expand their family. They tried several surrogates over the years, but went through miscarriages and failed pregnancy attempts. In  they found their latest surrogate, and began trying to conceive early last year. By February the surrogate was pregnant and the couple was absolutely overjoyed. Their joy doubled when just two months later a scan revealed they could expect not one, but two additions to their family.  The couple began preparing to welcome twins, saying the process went smoothly up until last Augustaposs bank holiday weekend when the surrogate went into premature labour. She was just  weeks along, and the couple said they drove for three-and-a-half hours to rush to hospital to meet the twins.The girls were taken straight into intensive care after a dficult birth, including one twin being born breech.Steven wrote: Having our girls in NICU was only the very beginning of our long, excruciating nightmare.The couple claim they had already paid out of their savings to their surrogate toward her pregnancy expenses. Before she was discharged from hospital she told them she wanted the remainder to be paid - bringing the amount they had given her nearly £, in total. After a few weeks had passed the tiny twins were fighting for their lives as they battled infections, received blood transfusions and lumbar punctures. One twin had to be resuscitated twice in hospital, and they had to do CPR on her once after they brought the girls home. After the initial trauma, the drama worsened with a surprise visit from their surrogateaposs boyfriend.  The couple claim he arrived at their door asking for more money. They told him they didnapost have the extra £, he asked for, as they had already drained their lesavings to pay for the surrogacy and were scrambling to meet the cost of caring for their poorly newborns. The couple claimed they then received a message from the surrogate warning she could can the handover process entirely.Steven wrote: A couple of days later I receive a text saying because we have not paid the extra money, our surrogate will not be putting meon the birth certicate and she will not sign a parental order . Feeling lost and terried we were going to lose our children we had to seek legal help.The couple said they had been through a series of legal hearings where the surrogate said she wanted to keep the twins - claiming her boyfriend is the father. They also claimed she banned them from seeing the children - despite the newbornsapos illnesses - and went on to register them under dferent names to the ones the couple had chosen. Steven wrote: Imagine not being able to know anything about your sick, premature newborn children. At this point they were extremely poorly so we did not even knowthey were alive. But the couple won a reprieve after a DNA test confirmed that he was the father - which we knew all along. The girls are now living with their dads, but they say the costly legal battle has left them out of pocket. The couple was appealing for support from the public after taking out loans of up to £k just to cover the legal costs, on top of the amount already paid out to their surrogate. They are hoping to cover the full legal bill - saying they understood that was not realistic - but we would be eternally grateful for any help at all.  Steven wrote: We are both nurses and have spent our working lives caring for others. I guess I am just hoping for some help from others in order to get us out of this awful situation. Due to our surrogateaposs actions we have not been able to enjoy the time we have had with our girls. Both having to try and work as much as we possibly can to break even and get us out of this downward spiral. The crowdfunding effort had raised nearly £, by early Tuesday morning. Surrogacy is legal in the UK, but unlike the US there are strict rules against commercial surrogacy. It is illegal to advertise for a surrogate to carry a baby in the UK, and there can be no financial benefit other than reasonable expenses. Gay men only recently got the right to become the legal parents of surrogate children in the UK. New legislation to extend legal parenthood rights to same-sex and unmarried couples was finally extended to gay men in . A baby does not lawfully belong to the parents until the surrogate signs a parental order issued after the childaposs birth.

Matthew Quinn, , has been handed a six-month sentence and a driving ban after pleading guilty to dangerous driving in Whickenham last April. Quinn parked his Mitsubishi Shogun in a disabled bay on Front Street but he did not display a disabled badge. Northumbria Police said Quinn came out from the bookmakers after two traffic warden gave him a ticket. Bodycam footage taken from one of the wardens shows Quinn becoming irate and aggressive in front of his daughter who is sitting in the front passenger seat. He walks over to grab the ticket and chews it up in pieces before throwing it towards the warden. He then allegedly hurls verbal abuse at them and gets into the car and drives towards the officers. Neighbourhood Inspector Harninder Bola, who covers the Whickham area, said: “When you watch the footage it really is shocking to see the way Matthew Quinn is behaving.  “He has illegally parked in a disabled bay and the traffic warden was just doing his job by issuing him with a parking ticket. “Quinn was acting in a very aggressive manner and that was very intimidating for the warden who did well to stay calm. “For Quinn to then get in his car and drive towards the victims was completely unacceptable and they were lucky not to be injured.  “In his rage he could have seriously harmed somebody and it was only right that we brought a criminal prosecution against him. “He has narrowly escaped a custodial sentence and I hope this case has given him time to reflect on his behaviour and learn from it moving forward.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man who missed bin collection","story":"NewsMan who missed bin collection day filmed dragging wheelie bins on back of carOnlookers were very perplexed to see a man with his green and blue wheelie bins attached to the back of a car at the Forthbank Recycling Centre in Alloa, ScotlandShareCommentsByPeter Davidson:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-who-forgot-bin-day-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news man-who-missed-bin-collection-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A court heard the pair had fallen out after Brown claimed she had been called “whomping” on Facebook – slang for fat. A video shows Brown repeatedly kicking Miss Parry’s front door in Worcester on November  last year before screaming: “Come out here you scabby c***.“Look at the state of your skin. I’m going to f *** you up b****. I’m coming for you.”The mum-of-two then walks away before running back to knock over two wheelie bins with a karate-style kick. Brown admitted using threatening, abusive and insulting words and criminal damage at Worcester Magistrate’s Court. Emily Clewer, prosecuting, said: The two women had been friends but their friendship became somewhat strained.“Miss Parry was asleep and woken up by loud banging on her front door and shouting coming from Miss Brown. “Miss Parry started to record what was happening on her phone.” The court heard Brown kicked Miss Parry’s door so hard half of it was cracked. Belinda Ariss, defending, told the court the women fell out when Miss Parryaposs ex-partner started dating one of Brownaposs friends.  She said: “Miss Parry seems to have taken exception to that. “There had been some name calling on Facebook. Miss Parry had called my client a aposcrack headapos and also aposwhompingapos which is another word for being overweight. “She accepts she kicked the door in temper and accepts shouting she is going to get her and such like.” Brown, of Worcester, was ordered to pay a total of £ in compensation and court costs.

The democratic services officer, , from London, was left distraught by the death of charity champion Tommy Blackmore, who died from a single punch after breaking up a fight in June . Tragically, her grief was compounded when she lost her dad Eddie to cancer just over a year later.  The new Islander’s heartbreak began when her friend Tommy died after stepping in to break up an argument outside a nightclub near Tower Bridge. The -year-old had been out partying before being caught up in the “wrong place at the wrong time”. Friends desperately tried to save him after the attack in June  as he lay unconscious in the street but he later passed away. Following his death, Shaughna uploaded a sweet pic of the pair, and paid tribute: Hoping this is all a nightmare and I wake up soon... I cannot put into words how much of a p*** take this boy is, he would do anything to be mischievous and I cannot believe Iaposm not going to be experiencing another one of his pranks again. I am actually heartbroken. Hope youaposre okay with the Angels Tom, love you and miss you.  She was amongst the huge crowds gathered at his funeral earlier to pay their respects to Tommy, who raised more than £, for Cancer Research UK. Alongside a picture capturing the huge crowd of mourners, she wrote: “A send off fit for a king! “Today was one of the hardest days of my le, saying goodbye to a very dear friend. Love you, Iaposll see you again boy.”    In September , Lloyd Smythe, then , was jailed for five-and-a-half years for manslaughter. The Old Bailey heard Smythe punched Mr Blackmore because he wrongly believed he had smashed his mobile phone. The following year, in December , Shaugna revealed that her dad Eddie had passed away from cancer.  In a moving tribute, she vowed to make her father proud in the future, writing: “My brave, amazing daddy passed away this morning at :am. “He has spent the past  days completely pain free, surrounded by all of his closest friends and family. “My mama hasnapost left his side once, and all of the stories and memories that have been spoken about have shown me itaposs okay to smile. “Cancer may have taken my dad but it cannot take the past  years away from me, and his love will stay with me forever. Me and my dad had loads of chats the past few months, and any promise I made to him will be fulfilled, I bet my le on it. “I will make that man so proud, I feel so robbed that my children will never meet their grandad, but they will be reminded every single day of just how special theirangel is.  “I asked you to come back and see me, so Iaposll be waiting daddy. Let me know youaposre okay. Iaposll miss you until the day we meet again big man. Love your little girl.” A year later, she got her dadaposs signature tattooed on his arm - alongside a line from a poem he had written.On Instagram , she shared: My dad hated tattoos and said he would never let me get one, so it was only right I didnapost listen to him and went and got one with his signature on it. The other day I was looking through my old paper work, and found one of my dads old poem lyrics book from . As I was going through it, the last poem he wrote finished with the sentence Hanging out in the clouds under the moon signed Eddie . Thataposs exactly where you are now my angel, and whenever Iaposm struggling, I only need to look down to remind myself. New Islander Shaughna will join  other islanders heading into the villa.

Video calling is apparently the next big thing, and the chance to see your match on the screen could before you actually go out could fix all of your first-date fears. The word aposdateapos instantly makes some people want to hide in a hole somewhere, with the pressures of saying something weird , praying you donapost have food stuck in your teeth, and the immense worry that your date is well and truly a catfish... So it makes sense that people are up for trying new ways to get to know their future date before the big day. Badoo was the first dating app to test this video feature in , which can only be activated once both parties have matched and exchanged one message. Itaposs also handy that the call happens through the app so thereaposs no need to share any personal details like your phone number. Tristan Pineiro, head of communications, claims that the chances of a real le date being a success are higheryouaposve had a video call before. He said: Of course, we canapost ignore the security aspect. On a call you can quickly see that the person is who they say they are, Weaposd encourage all our daters to make time for this before meeting anyone for the first time, just to be sure.  There are lots of benefits to video calling before you meet, including...  It can reduce the initial anxiety linked with first dates, replacing it with excitement When you add up all of the time thataposs spent prepping for the date, travelling there and back, and the money spent... it works out a considerable amount of effort. Video calling them first allows you to assess whether theyaposre even worth itIdeal for long distance matches. Great icebreaker - anything to help stop those awkward silences.

Not only are they a joy to look at, their kind nature also means they are likely to be the goodest boys and girls you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. So it came as a bit of a surprise to thousands on the internet when actor and comedian Andy Richter shared an MRI scan of his friendaposs dog to discover that manaposs best friend was downright aposterryingapos on the inside. And although many found amusement in scan of the poor little pug, a vet has said it also highlights the concerning results of selective breeding which have a detrimental impact on the health of the breed.Andy tweeted the image from the scan showing the dogaposs signature bulging eyes with the caption: aposMy friendaposs pug went to the vetapos.Itaposs attracted more than , likes, with many left in stitches by the results. One replied: This made me laugh uncontrollably for two minutes straight. Another said: Amazing. Pugs may be the only creature to look exactly the same in X-Ray as in visible light. Some were slight unsure, with a third writing: That is simultaneously the cutest and most terrying thing I have seen in my entire le. Thank you for the happy nightmares this image will bring me tonight.  After the tweet went viral, Andy added an update to let everyone know that the pug was given a clean bill of health and was aposnonplussedapos by its new found fame.Rory Cowlam, a vet based in London, told the Independent that although most MRI images, including those taken of humans, would look unusual to the untrained eye, he conceded the pugaposs snapshot was apospretty odd lookingaposDr Cowlam said: Their faces have been shortened due to intensive breeding by humans, unfortunately.  They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses - the condition is called brachycephalism. We have, through human selection, bred them to look more like a human baby because we find that cute, but unfortunately that cute look is not very good for the animal. With other breeds including French bulldogs and Shih Tzus also suffering from the same condition, Dr Cowlam said he would aposactively encourageapos prospective owners to think again about buying animals with brachycephalism.

That was a dficult time.“We’ve had loads of ups and downs but the past year is certainly one, for the first half of it anyway, we want to put behind us as quickly as possible.“With the recent bit of form and positivity, we take that into  and kick on.”Dundee start the year with three home matches on the bounce, firstly against potential play-off rivals Caley Thistle and Ayr United before they welcome high-flying Premiership side Motherwell to Dens Park for a Scottish Cup tie.“We have dficult games coming up. We have three games at home now and we need to get back to making this place a fortress,” Kerr added.“I said it at the start of the season that,we wanted to do anything in this league, we’ve got to make our home form much better than it has been.“It is better than it has been over the past year but it’s still not where we want it to be.“That’s something we are working so hard every day to put right.“Every game we go into, we expect ourselves to win. That’s not being arrogant or cocky but what Dundee should be aiming for.“There needs to be a realisation of how good this squad can be.”And Kerr says the second half against league leaders United last Friday gives everyone associated with the club belief they can start looking upwards.“There was a wee realisation after the game we could have taken three points.“The boys have spoken since and we’re starting to realise how well we can do as a team.“After we got the goal at Tannadice, there was a belief on the pitch and I think the fans felt that.“Even when the board went up for how long was left, the fans still thought we could win it.“Hopefully, that is a wee turning point for us – it needs to be going forward.“There has been a lot of disappointment, a lot of games where we have huffed and puffed throughout the season.“Last Friday, the fans came again in their numbers and I didn’t expect there to be so many, to be honest.“United had three of the stands but our fans were so loud again and when we scored it was great to go and celebrate with them.“Our fans have had to endure a dficult year, especially with United being on top since day one.“We are happy with how it went but, at the same time, we need to make sure we don’t rest on a draw – we need to remember we didn’t win – but use it to kick us on.”Dundee have faced the Caley Jags three times this season, winning -, drawing - and losing - last time in Inverness.Dundee United - Dundee: Dorrans# first goal earns Dee derby point\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united---dundee-dorrans-first-goal-earns-dee-derby-point embed # secretynOUlpvmC\" data-secret\"ynOUlpvmC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Kerr added: “We are under no illusions how tough it will be tomorrow.

However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e0f531a474512.80393139-940x540.jpg ","title":"mcpake laments poor dee display","story":"Dundee manager James McPake believes their - defeat to Inverness at Dens on Saturday was as poor as they’ve been all season.The Dark Blues went down with a whimper to the Caley Jags as first-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings had the game over as a contest after  minutes.And boss James ranks the loss up there with the - derby defeat to rivals Dundee United and the - capitulation against Partick at Dens.Askedhis side struggle to find he right levels at home, the Dee gaffer said: “No, I don’t think so.“You can pick games at home and away from home where we’ve been really good so it’s about being the way we are when we’re good and getting after teams.Dundee - Inverness CTGoals from Aaron Doran and @jameskeatings give nd placed Inverness CT victory at Dens Park against Dundee.@ICTFC @DundeeFC @spfl pic oCfXziEkmdash Sky Sports ScotlandJanuary , “On Saturday, for that first  minutes, it was as poor as we’ve been all season so I can’t even look at the other games where we have been poor.“We started the game really badly on Saturday and I don’t think it’s got anything to do with where we’re playing.“We just never came out the blocks the way we should’ve on the back of a half-decent run.”And that lack of momentum carried over from the - derby draw at Tannadice the weekend previous, given they were also on a four-match unbeaten run, surprised James.He added: “There should have been .“We were on the back of a half-decent run of form and I mean that with the consistency of our performances.“It looked like we knew what we were going to get over the past month or so in terms of the performance.“The energy and the drive in the team wasn’t there on Saturday.“Inverness were the opposite.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

Sadly for some, it has been their final holiday together.#The families have been blown away by their stays at Dumfries House. The peace and tranquility of the estate make it an ideal getaway and the staff could not have done more. Our families have come away from each break with unforgettable memories and a renewed energy and focus for whatever may come next.#Louis MacCallum, director of commercial for the Prince#s Foundation at Dumfries House, said: #Anyone who has met Caroline and Duncan cannot fail to be inspired into helping their charity in any way they can.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

He must be the most patient man alive, almost a social media saint. Watch him calmly respond to vilication and abuse every time he points out that taxes raised in Scotland could not sustain public spending, were Scotland to become independent tomorrow.Scotland has a nominal deficit of several billions of pounds which could cause immediate fiscal belt-tighteningthe Barnett taps were turned off. I say nominal because there is much controversy over Haguersquos figures.However, he won a signicant victory last year when the Scottish Government largely accepted, in the Sustainable Growth Commission, his arguments about Scotlandrsquos fiscal position, based as they are on the GERS calculations of Government spending and revenues.Nicola Sturgeon now accepts that independence will involve short-term spending restraint. Thatrsquos better than long-term decline under Westminster rule, she says. Yoursquod think that this admission would have damaged the SNPrsquos electoral standing, but the reverse is true. Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union. They did not vote to lose their EU citizenship, with all the protections that brings. They did not vote to cut EU immigration did not vote to accept trade deals with the United States did not agree to the diminution of environmental standards and did not vote to be subjected to untrammelled Tory rule from Westminster.Thatrsquos really all the SNP need to say.

Greta, after all has become a saintly figure. It was watching a young girl with Aspergers having a meltdown and being applauded by an audience of adults who appeared to think that this was entirely normal.Going back to watch a few more clips, Gretarsquos smallness and childlike appearance clearly adds to the strangeness of these events. Influential, powerful adults sit or stand aside her on stage, towering above Greta and seemingly appreciating the  year old who is screaming at them for not saving the planet.For all the talk of science, these occasions feel more religious than rational, more emotional than thought through. But it is not only with Greta that we have begun to see the elevation of children and young people as sage-like figures. British, indeed Western culture appears to be in the throws of a cult of youth.Enlightened politicians call for  year olds to be given the vote. This at a time when  year olds are less independent, less likely to be in full time employment, for example, than they have ever been. There is political opportunism in this demand to enfranchise children of course but there is also something  going on.We see this something  in commentaries about the Brexit vote, a vote that apparently ldquostole the future of young people. Here, old people, or what are at times called ldquoboomers are separated out from the rest of the electorate, and denounced for voting for Brexit.Novelist Ian McEwan went so far as to celebrate the future deaths of over a million ldquooldsters by the end of , a group of ldquomostly Brexiters, freshly in their graves. Unable to win the arguments, Remoaners bordered upon a eugenics mindset, waiting impatiently for the elderly to die out so that their own enlightened views could flourish.The cult of youth is seen most powerfully in environmentalism where we see not only the saint like elevation of a teenager but virtual state sponsoring of children going out on ldquostrike. Here the wisdom of youth is played out against a backdrop of adult greed and destruction, ironically, egged on by teachers and politicians ie older adults.The cult of youth appears to be less enlightened than we may think, based less upon a celebration of the young than on a hatred of the old, indeed an abandonment of adulthood."},{"url":null,"title":"botanic-gardens-seeks-gardener-help-restore-glory","story":"Now a global search has been launched for a head gardener to oversee a major restoration of Achamore Gardens on the island of Gigha.They attract enthusiasts from around the globe, who marvel at what can be grown in the islandrsquos micro-climate.But as the economic fortunes of the community-owned island improve, it has been decided to write a new chapter in the gardensrsquo story, with an ambitious plan to update the exotic collection.This will include exhaustive surveys of its general health and a plan for new gardens and facilities for visitors.The full-time head gardener will help mastermind the work, and inwill have a rent-free cottage on the island as well as a salary.The gardensrsquo story really begins in  when Sir James Horlick of the bedtime drink family, bought Gigha off the Kintyre Peninsula.He had been touring the west of Scotland, to seehe could find a location where he could indulge his botanical passions, in particular for rhododendrons.When he heard Gighawas for sale, he knew it would fit his plan.Where the gardens now stand, had been  acres of old mixed woodland, which was used for pheasant rearing.Sir James went to work to realise his vision, as Catherine Czserkawska records in her book - Godrsquos Islanders, A History of the people of Gigha: ldquoHe, or rather his gardener managed to create a unique environment in the already sheltered gardens by cutting small clearings among the established ponticum and tree cover, where he could establish unique and tender species of rhododendron as well as camellias, azaleas and other sub-tropical shrubs and hybrids which seem to thrive here. In the gardens are for example , masses of Gunnera manicata from Brazil, like enormous clumps of rhubarb beneath which not just children, but adults too can shelter...Sir James died in  and was buried on Gigha. He left some of his collection to the National Trust for Scotlandso that his special plants could be conserved.The community-led Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust , which bought the island in , is now in discussion with the NTS over how best to proceed with a restoration plan.IGHT Chairman Ian Wilson said: ldquoWe are actively seeking funding not just to restore Achamore Gardens, but to take them forward for future generations. We want to find somebody with the experience, knowledge, energy and enthusiasm to help the community achieve its goal.An NTS spokesperson said ldquoThe National Trust for Scotland has had a long relationship with Achamore Garden, Isle of Gigha and its successive owners, beginning with Sir James Horlick who bought the site in .\"The Isle of Gigha Heritage Trust, which took over the garden as part of the community buy-out in , is currently working with the NTS to explore options for its future sustainability.In the th century around  people lived on the island but that had dropped to around  by the end of the the last century. Within four years of the buyout the population had increased by more than -per cent to , reversing  years of decline.Although people have come and gone, the IGHT has been successful in retaining that population.But Gigha is not immune to the demographic pressures facing communities. Some , more than half of the  residents, are now over  years and  of them are over  years.Brandon Clements, then , in March became a director of the island trustrsquos board, determined to act before the statistics worsen, and believes his own experience can help.The trust bought the island off previous owner Derek Holt for just over poundm. It repaid a poundm loan to the Scottish Land Fund, over  years ago, as part of a pound.m support package.

To say it has been devastating would be the understatement of the year.And while the consensus is that not every extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change, Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, noted that with the average temperature in Australia now running around one degree higher than the long-term figure, fire seasons are starting earlier and ldquothe cumulative fire danger is growing. Or, as University of Sydney ecologist Professor Glenda Wardle put it, while not every weather event is the direct result of rising temperatures, ldquowhen you see trends it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change.So why the reticence from Australiarsquos leaders to name the issue, too  Back in November Mr McCormack caused outrage when he dismissed climate concerns as the obsession of ldquoraving inner-city lefties, while prime minister Scott Morrison continues to defend carbon-emissions policies that are widely held to be inadequate for a G member. The reason would seem plain for all to see, with the opportunity for Australia to expand its lucrative role as a leading exporter of fossil fuels apparently making the science just too easy to ignore.It is an unforgivable stance to take, and one that is entirely out of step with the general direction of travel. Indeed, at a time when local and national governments around the world have declared a climate emergency, the onus is on all of us to do our bit to avert the crisis. The younger generation has risen to the challenge, taking to the streets to shame policymakers into taking action. Older generations are making changes too, dumping fossil-fuel companies from their investment portfolios and putting pressure on employers to eliminate them from their pensions.It is not just small investors who are taking more of an interest in what their money is funding, with more and more institutional investors starting to question the moral legitimacy of channelling funds into companies whose activities are contributing to the destruction of the planet. Environmental organisation , which aims to ldquoend the age of fossil fuels, says more than , asset managers, pension funds and insurers have pledged to take such action, the aim being to ldquoremove [companiesrsquo] social licence to operate.The Church of England, which has an pound. billion investment pot at its disposal, is one such investor. In  the churchrsquos General Synod voted by  to four to est its holdings in fossil-fuel companies, with a spokesperson saying at the time that the vote made clear that the church ldquomust play a leading role and exercise its moral leadership on the urgent issue of climate change. Attempts are being made to see the Church of Scotland follow suit. Although last May its General Assembly narrowly rejected a motion that would have seen it disinvest from oil and gas companies, Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of the Church and Society Council, has said it must now take action ldquoas a matter of urgency.Writing in The Herald last month, he said the council believes that ldquofor reasons of conscience and out of an urgent necessity to respond to what is happening to our planet, we must accelerate the process of weaning ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels. ldquoIn taking this decision we have approved a report which we will be commending to next yearrsquos General Assembly, recommending that the Church sells its shares in oil and gas companies as a matter of urgency, he wrote.Yet while Dr Frazer stressed that the council had made its decision based on its deeply held belief that Christians have ldquoa duty to care for Godrsquos earth, will the Kirk actually be able to fulfil that dutyit washes its hands of those companies completely  Surely it would do more good by retaining its investments and using its position as a high-profile investor to drive positive change from within It is certainly the opinion of mega-investor Bill Gates that estment programmes are all but pointless, with the removal of even large sums of money unlikely to have enough of an impact to make oil or gas giants change course. Others, such as Japanrsquos . trillion national pension fund, prefer to engage with the companies they invest in, using their clout as major shareholders to hold management teams to account. It is the right approach: while no amount of engagement will stop a fossil-fuel company being a fossil-fuel company, these businesses like any other can and should be forced to set and achieve emissions-reduction targets.It is worth noting that while the Church of England has sold out of positions in tar sands and thermal coal businesses, it retains large investments in oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Crucially, it has started voting against the re-election of chairmen of companies such as EOG Resources for doing too little to combat climate change. It is exactly the kind of activism that is needed.Ultimately, while it is clear that carbon emissions from fossil fuels are causing the planet to warm, the only way for fossil-fuel companies to be driven out of existence is for everyone to stop using fossil fuels. As that is not likely to fully happen for many years ndashever ndash it is better that investors like the Church of Scotland use their boardroom influence to ensure those businesses are contributing to the solution rather than just blaming them for creating the problem.It may seem counterintuitive, but the climate crisis will never be solvedeveryone simply stands shouting from the sidelines."},{"url":null,"title":"one-day-little-womens-jo-might-real-equality","story":"Throughout Greta Gerwigs radical new adaptation of Little Women, female economic and social power are questioned and explored, as are the ious effects of marriage on a womans le.What has changed, from then until now Here is Marmee, taking on the unpaid caring role for the entire town.Here is Meg, her domestic labours undermined and undervalued by her husband.Here is Jo, determined to be an independent, single woman, to \"paddle my own canoe\" but being pressured into marriage, questioned relentlessly about why she doesnt want to have a relationship.\"You remind me of myself,\" Marmee tells Jo, following Jos failure to keep a grip on her explosive temper.\"But youre never angry,\" Jo replies.\"Im angry nearly every day of my le,\" Marmee says. And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-murray-launches-labour-deputy-leader-bid","story":"Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, won his seat with a majority of more than , and was the only Labour MP to win a seat.In his piece he wrote:ldquoI never again want to feel like I did at pm on the night of the general election.The former shadow Scottish secretary becomes the sixth candidate to declare in the contest and will stand againstshadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities secretary Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood.In an exclusive article written forThe Mirror,the former shadow Scottish secretary said: ldquoIrsquom standing to be deputy leader of the Labour Party because I want to help us win power to transform lives.:Ian Murray lsquoexploring the possibilitiesrsquo of running for deputy Labour leaderldquoGrowing up on the Wester Hailes council estate in Edinburgh, the Tory Government believed families like ours didnrsquot deserve support.

He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell.

James added: “It’s been many years in the making, so we’ll be keeping in contact with our end customers and trade clients throughout to see what the appetite is like for our new flavour.“Who knows, we may even be able to expand the run to make it a permanent addition to our range.

As a global society we went into ecological overdraft in our use of resources in the late s. The amount of raw materials extracted has tripled since then and our use of fossil fuels continues to rise, so our global footprint is now running at nearly two planets’ worth.At one end of the problem, we see oceans of plastic and a climate that is heading for chaos. Less visible, at least to us, is the environmental destruction and social damage done by megamines, cash crops and deforestation, all to feed our demands for things we don’t really need. We cannot go on abusing the planet like this.: A new lease of le for Scottish innovation: Earth Overshoot Day: Planet’s annual resources quota exceeded earlier than ever beforeIn Scotland, we are living three-planet lestyles –everyone in the world lived as wastefully as us, we would need the resources of three planets.Since I have a PhD in astrophysics, I can tell you that there are no other planets we can use.Of our nearest neighbours, Venus is a similar size to the Earth but suffers from a run-away greenhouse effect with average temperatures near C and a pressure of  atmospheres. The lovely white clouds  They are made of sulphuric acid. If you stepped out of your spacecraft unprotected, you would be crushed, boiled and dissolved all at once.Going outwards from the Sun there is Mars, rather smaller than Earth. SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk is keen on establishing a colony there but the average temperature is mius C and there is only about one per cent the atmospheric pressure of Earth, and that’s almost entirely unbreathable carbon dioxide.Concentrate politicians’ mindsSo we are stuck with just the one planet and we need to treat it more gentlywe want to survive. Scotland has made some good progress on things like creating a deposit- scheme for cans and bottles but on the basics we are failing, with recycling rates actually falling and far off track to meet our targets. The new Circular Economy Bill, due in the spring, ought to be the chance to do much more on our over-use of resources. It should be all about how we use resources much more efficiently than today, and virtually eliminate waste.While the proposals for the Bill contain many good things, they are not the system-changing measures we need. There’s a danger the once-in-a-decade opportunity to do something about waste will do little more than introduce a latte levy and make sure the recycling bins arethe same colour across Scotland. We need an approach like our Climate Acts, which set targets, require plans and reports to Parliament and concentrate the minds of politicians and civil servants on delivering urgent change. This is the kind of approach being adopted in France, Finland and the Netherlands, with the latter aiming to have a fully circular economy by  and a  per cent reduction in the use of key resources by .Because fossil fuels are included in the ecological footprint measure, our current climate targets take us some of the way towards a circular economy, but complementary targets on the use of resources would complete the picture and set us in the path to a far more equitable one-planet living.Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"golden globe winner brian cox we need action to help scotland attract film and tv productions","story":"Golden Globe-winner Brian Cox has called for more action to help Scotland attract major film and TV productions.The actor said Scotland \"has the ability\" but needs more studio space to be able to capitalise on its talent.Plans to create a full-time permanent film studio in Scotland - in addition to the converted warehouse in Cumbernauld where the Outlander TV series is shot - have been troubled.A £ million purpose-built facility planned for the Pentland Estate on the outskirts of Edinburgh was stymied last year by a court ruling in a land tenancy row, prompting a change of plans to a site at Dalkeith, Midlothian.Separately, Screen Scotland planned to put a private firm in place to turn a former wave power plant at the citys Leith Docks, used in producing Marvels Avengers: Infinity War, into a round-the-clock film studio last spring but this deadline was missed. - Golden Globes : These are Ricky Gervais most outrageous jokes Now, Cox - who won best actor in a TV drama for his role as ageing media magnate Logan Roy in Succession at the Golden Globe awards in LA on Monday - wants more to be done.Speaking on BBC Scotlands The Nine, he said: \"Weve got great crews in Scotland - thats why we really need to get that studio off the ground.\"We can service so many films, weve got the ability.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind.

With Brexit set for January , Mr Javid will today explain how the UK can take advantage of the \"huge opportunities\" that he claimed will be presented by leaving the European Union. The Government is set to increase borrowing in order to fund promises made in the Tory election manesto, with Mr Javid saying \"the country voted for change\" by backing Boris Johnson at the ballot box in December. Promising an \"infrastructure revolution\" in his first Budget as Chancellor, Mr Javid indicated there would be up to £bn available for \"transformative\" projects across the country over the coming years. Speaking during a visit to the new £m Trafford Park tram line project in Manchester, Mr Javid said: \"The country voted for change. There are still too many people in our great country that feel left behind and we are going to deliver that change.\" Mr Javid will provide an economic update to the Cabinet today before facing MPs in the Commons as theyfrom their Christmas break. \"With this Budget we will unleash Britains potential - uniting our great country, opening a new chapter for our economy and ushering in a decade of renewal,\" Mr Javid said. \"People across the country have told us that they want change.

With this Budget we will open a new chapter for our economy and usher in a decade of renewal.\"During the general election campaign Mr Javid made a decisive break from the policies adopted by his predecessors, promising to loosen constraints on borrowing to the tune of up to £bn a year for capital spending. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"After a decade of wrecking the economy, we can have no confidence in a Tory Government delivering the scale of investment needed for renewal especially with a no-deal Brexit still on the table.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast family pays tribute to beautiful baby sophie hamilton","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

A further strike has also been planned for Friday. However, last night the permanent secretary of the Department of Health said it was still not too late for trade unions to defer the industrial action and get back around the negotiating table.Richard Pengelly said the Royal College of Nursing has written to the department detailing a series of proposals on staffing.He said: \"Up to this point, discussions with unions had concentrated on pay issues. Now, the RCN has itemised specic demands in respect of safe staffing levels. In our view, these proposals can provide the basis for serious engagement.\"We have repeatedly made clear that our door remained open for discussions, with the specic aim of drawing up a detailed, costed implementation plan on staffing.\"We see no good reason why such dialogue cannot begin immediately. Deferring strike action would be in the best interests of patient and patient safety and would provide the necessary space for fresh dialogue.\"Our hospitals are already under severe pressure at present, even before the planned industrial action takes place this week.\"\"In terms of political resolution, all main political parties have already publicly supported the calls for parity with England and talks are ongoing about restoration of the devolved institutions,\" he said. \"It is only that process that can provide the mechanism for a sustainable solution on pay.\"In that context, we would encourage unions to reflect on what possible objective could be served by further industrial action at this time.\"The ballot by the Royal College of Midwivesopened yesterday and will close on January .They urged members to \"vote yes\", calling for industrial action up to and including strike action.The RCM claims the decision to ballot its members \"comes after nine years of pay restraint which has seen midwives and Maternity Support Workers ... earn up to £, less than their colleagues in England\".Karen Murray, the RCMs director for Northern Ireland, explained: \"We have exhausted every avenue over a number of years in trying to resolve this dispute with the Department of Health.\"Despite our best efforts to negotiate a fair pay deal for our members, the department have failed to come to an agreement.\"Our midwives here are much worse off in their pay packet than their colleagues in other parts of the UK.\"This is simply neither right nor fair. That is why we are recommending our members to vote yes to industrial action.\"Meanwhile, additional strike action from the Royal College of Nursingis set to take place tomorrow and Friday, while members of the largest healthcare union Unison will walk out on Friday.

ERC, which holds  seats, is one of several groups that want Catalonia’s independence from Spain.Opposition parties, most of them right-wing, have lambasted Mr Sanchez for striking deals with parties intent on breaking up Spain, though he has insisted he will not allow the wealthy region’s secession.Pablo Casado, leader of the main opposition centre-right Popular Party, described Mr Sanchez as an “extremist” for putting the government in the hands of “terrorists and coup supporters” in references to the deals made with Basque and Catalan separatist parties to abstain in Tuesday’s vote.The Catalan independence push has brought Spain’s most serious political crisis in decades.The Socialists defend the deal with ERC, saying the Catalan crisis must be resolved through talks, something they have agreed to do with the ERC.Mr Sanchez tried to get elected in a first parliamentary confidence vote last Sunday, but he fell far short of the target of  votes. Under Spanish law, in the second round of voting on Tuesday he needed only a simple majority — more votes for him than against him.King Felipe VI asked him to try to form a government following the November  ballot, when the Socialists got the most votes but only  seats in the -seat Chamber of Deputies, Spain’s parliament.Mr Sanchez and United We Can leader Pablo Iglesias say they want to raise minimum salaries, income tax for high earners and capital gains tax. They also vow to defend women’s and immigrants’ rights."},{"url":null,"title":"506459","story":"US socialist and New York based trade union organiser Sherry Wolf will be in Derry on Wednesday to speak about efforts to challenge the policies of US President Donald Trump and the growing socialist movement in the US. Sherry Wolf said, Im delighted to have the opportunity to speak in Derry. The election of Donald Trump was a nightmare. In office hes pursued policies favouring the super rich and powerful corporations. He appeals to the most reactionary and racist sentiments in US society, even embracing neo-nazis. Its no surprise he has flamed the potential of yet another very destructive US regional war in the Middle East. googletag.cmd.push But he also faces tremendous resistance from trade unions, from women and a great cross section of ordinary people in the US. There will be widespread opposition to his designs for war on Iran. Thousands have already taken to the streets in protest. He has galvanised many people into campaigns for social justice and into a growing socialist movement. Sherry is a long-time womens equality and anti-war campaigner, Palestine solidarity activist and author of Sexuality and Socialism: History, Politics and Theory of Gay Liberation.

They deserve our admiration and support for courageously taking action to end both contemptuous year on year pay cuts and the criminal destruction of the NHS. All the establishment parties involved in talks with the Tory Secretary of State Julian Smith cant claim they dont understand the demands of nurses and health workers now.

By doing so he is using peoples lives, our health service workers and nurses as a political football. We should not stand for this contempt. The funding is there and it should be immediately be released to begin the process of addressing the crisis in the NHS and meeting pay justice demands.  If the Assembly is to be revived the hostility to the demands and needs of ordinary must end. All the Stormont establishment parties have shown nothing but contempt towards working people. Stormont can no longer be a place where rackets rule, where parties carve-up resources to suit themselves and where public services are destroyed while wealthy corporations are rewarded with hundreds of millions of pounds in tax cuts. googletag.cmd.push We wont allow the striking nurses and health service workers to be scapegoated for this crisis or for taking action.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In winter, woods take on a whole new character - spectacular, frosty landscapes. Perfect for enjoying nature’s sights and sounds while burning off some of those extra calories! Crunch through frosty leaves, discover ancient hidden history or spot some elusive wildle – a woodland walk could spring up surprises you’ll never forget. Of course a visit is free and you’ll feel great after too. Here are some great woods across across Derry to visit during the festive season: Drumnaph Wood, Maghera googletag.cmd.push Drumnaph occupies a ridge above the meandering Grillagh River, which allows you to enjoy the views west to Carntogher Mountain and the beautul Sperrin Mountains.With over , trees planted in recent years, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was relatively young woodland, but actually, around % of the site is ancient woodland, making it a rare remnant of the great forest that once covered much of mid-Ulster.Winter provides a good chance to spot Irish hare as they are often seen around the edges of the woodland and in the surrounding fields in the colder months of the year. Prehen Wood googletag.cmd.push This rare and irreplaceable ancient woodland has a magical feel, with carpets of bluebell, celandine and wood anemone in the spring. It is home to the red squirrel, sparrowhawk and long-eared owl and offers terric views overlooking Derry city, as well as the River Foyle.Look out for the wooden sculptures created by Michael Rodgers that watch over the woods. There’s a squirrel, fox, hedgehog and butterfly to spot as you wander through the woodland.

Mary’s legacy will live on through all those who knew and loved her,” added the school principal.Former principal of St. Mary’s and long term colleague Tom O’Kane who worked with Mrs. Jamison for  years, also paid tribute“Mary was the le and soul of the school. She lit up every room she entered,” said the former principal.“She always found practical solutions to seemingly intractable problems, even imposed curriculum changes were soon worked through with Mary at the helm,” he said.“Mary was an inspiration to many pupils who followed her into the teaching profession. She was gentle but always told it as it was. Mary was a brilliant teacher and more importantly, a good friend to me,” added Tom. Mary’s Requiem Mass took place yesterday , at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Trench Road, with internment afterwards at St. Mary’s Cemetry, Ardmore.Mary is survived by her son Christopher, daughters Deirdre, Claire, Cathy and Anna, grandchildren Amy, Caoimhe, Erin, Holly, Noah and Jamie and brothers Seamus, Francis, Eugene, and was predeceased by her brother Damian. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The ‘Stute players were enraged that an apparent e by a Dungannon player in the build-up went unpunished but referee Steven Gregg played on, and Chris Lowe was able to cross into the six-yard box where Rhys Campbell, who only started due to an injury to Oisin Smyth in the warm up, tapped in from close range.The ill feeling from the last meeting between these two teams, which saw several red cards after the final whistle, was still evident, and after Niall Grace was cautioned for a challenge on Seanan Clucas, the Swts captain theatrically went down just outside the ‘Stute penalty area, and was surprisingly awarded a free kick. Douglas Wilson took the kick left-footed and almost found the bottom corner, only for Wells to push it behind for a corner.There was still absolutely no threat from ‘Stute to talk of and it would have been -not for an unbelievable save from Wells on  minutes. Goal scorer Campbell could not be stopped as he ran theof the pitch down the left wing, all the way into the ‘Stute penalty area, where he put the ball at the foot of Caolan McAleer who must have thought a goal was his until Wells somehow sprang across his goal to keep the ball out. It was a vital save from the ‘Stute goalkeeper.‘Stute somehow hung on and just before the half time break they got the goal they desperately needed. Oran Brogan won a free kick wide on the right just inside the Swts half, and Cormac Burke’s curling delivery into the heart of the penalty area eluded everyone, except Gareth Brown who headed home from close range following hesitation by goalkeeper Conor Byrne. It was just what Connor and his players needed after a one-sided and tension-filled first half. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -‘Stute were a dferent team entirely at the start of the second half, playing with an enthusiasm and a determination that was completely absent in the first period. Joe McCready for one was getting himself into the game as ‘Stute looked dangerous and were the better team for the first time in the game.That said, it still took until the hour mark before they tested Byrne again, and the Swts goalkeeper was very nearly caught by surprise, as Alex Pomeroy tried his luck from  yards, a half volley on the turn by Pomeroy flying towards the bottom corner until the goalkeeper touched it behind for a corner. From that corner, ‘Stute were nearly caught out themselves as Swts broke three on one, but Ryan Strain hesitated just a fraction too long, allowing numbers to get back, and when he did get the cross in, McAleer shot into the side netting and ‘Stute survived.The game was now end to end and McCready was left berating himself after he latched onto a superb ball through the heart of midfield by Graham Crown, but with a clear run on goal his touch deserted him and Byrne was able to come off his line to claim the ball.This was now a very competitive cup tie which both teams believed they could win, but disaster struck ‘Stute and in particular Graham Crown on  minutes. Under pressure from two Swts players, Crown attempted to head the ball back to his goalkeeper, but his attempt fell too short and Ben Gallagher, just on as a substitute simply lted it over the head of the stranded Wells into the net to make it -.It was hard to take for the home side, especially given their second half display, but they came again and nearly equalised within minutes, the impressive McCready picking out a cross for Pomeroy, but the youngster could not get enough on his header and glanced it well off target.To their immense credit, ‘Stute kept coming and they brought it level again after Burke worked his way into the penalty area, held off two challenges and curled the ball brilliantly beyond Byrne and into the top corner to make it - much to the delight of his manager and team mates.The game was headed to extra time but ‘Stute were left devastated as Michael Carvill got away with  minutes on the clock and kept his head to curl the ball beyond Wells and into the net to win the game for Swts in the most dramatic of fashions. Connor kept his players in the changing rooms for half an hour after the game, such was his annoyance with his teams exit from the cup.

The ‘Stute players were enraged that an apparent e by a Dungannon player in the build-up went unpunished but referee Steven Gregg played on, and Chris Lowe was able to cross into the six-yard box where Rhys Campbell, who only started due to an injury to Oisin Smyth in the warm up, tapped in from close range.The ill feeling from the last meeting between these two teams, which saw several red cards after the final whistle, was still evident, and after Niall Grace was cautioned for a challenge on Seanan Clucas, the Swts captain theatrically went down just outside the ‘Stute penalty area, and was surprisingly awarded a free kick. Douglas Wilson took the kick left-footed and almost found the bottom corner, only for Wells to push it behind for a corner.There was still absolutely no threat from ‘Stute to talk of and it would have been -not for an unbelievable save from Wells on  minutes. Goal scorer Campbell could not be stopped as he ran theof the pitch down the left wing, all the way into the ‘Stute penalty area, where he put the ball at the foot of Caolan McAleer who must have thought a goal was his until Wells somehow sprang across his goal to keep the ball out. It was a vital save from the ‘Stute goalkeeper.‘Stute somehow hung on and just before the half time break they got the goal they desperately needed. Oran Brogan won a free kick wide on the right just inside the Swts half, and Cormac Burke’s curling delivery into the heart of the penalty area eluded everyone, except Gareth Brown who headed home from close range following hesitation by goalkeeper Conor Byrne. It was just what Connor and his players needed after a one-sided and tension-filled first half. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -‘Stute were a dferent team entirely at the start of the second half, playing with an enthusiasm and a determination that was completely absent in the first period. Joe McCready for one was getting himself into the game as ‘Stute looked dangerous and were the better team for the first time in the game.That said, it still took until the hour mark before they tested Byrne again, and the Swts goalkeeper was very nearly caught by surprise, as Alex Pomeroy tried his luck from  yards, a half volley on the turn by Pomeroy flying towards the bottom corner until the goalkeeper touched it behind for a corner. From that corner, ‘Stute were nearly caught out themselves as Swts broke three on one, but Ryan Strain hesitated just a fraction too long, allowing numbers to get back, and when he did get the cross in, McAleer shot into the side netting and ‘Stute survived.The game was now end to end and McCready was left berating himself after he latched onto a superb ball through the heart of midfield by Graham Crown, but with a clear run on goal his touch deserted him and Byrne was able to come off his line to claim the ball.This was now a very competitive cup tie which both teams believed they could win, but disaster struck ‘Stute and in particular Graham Crown on  minutes. Under pressure from two Swts players, Crown attempted to head the ball back to his goalkeeper, but his attempt fell too short and Ben Gallagher, just on as a substitute simply lted it over the head of the stranded Wells into the net to make it -.It was hard to take for the home side, especially given their second half display, but they came again and nearly equalised within minutes, the impressive McCready picking out a cross for Pomeroy, but the youngster could not get enough on his header and glanced it well off target.To their immense credit, ‘Stute kept coming and they brought it level again after Burke worked his way into the penalty area, held off two challenges and curled the ball brilliantly beyond Byrne and into the top corner to make it - much to the delight of his manager and team mates.The game was headed to extra time but ‘Stute were left devastated as Michael Carvill got away with  minutes on the clock and kept his head to curl the ball beyond Wells and into the net to win the game for Swts in the most dramatic of fashions. Connor kept his players in the changing rooms for half an hour after the game, such was his annoyance with his teams exit from the cup.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
