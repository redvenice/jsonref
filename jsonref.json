She will be much more visible now she isn\u0027t being held back.\u0027She will lead both party reform and the development of a policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters we need to win.\u0027In a sign Sir Keir and Ms Rayner have not managed to bury the hatchet, one party insider asked: \u0027Who would want to be national campaign co-ordinator in name only with no power when you\u0027re made the scapegoat for the failures of Keir\u0027s team?\u0027Another supporter of Ms Rayner said: \u0027On Friday Keir couldn\u0027t answer a simple question about what Labour\u0027s vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the voters in our heartland seats.\u0027Angela can answer that question and is the best person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall.\u0027 According to the Guardian, Oldham MP Jim McMahon, who ran the Hartlepool by-election campaign and is an ally of Sir Keir, complained to the leader\u0027s office that Ms Rayner had been \u0027dressed inappropriately\u0027 on a visit to the town on March 21. Photographs from the date show Ms Rayner in leopard-print trousers, heavy black boots and a hoodie. Ms Rayner\u0027s aides are said to have \u0027hit the roof \u0027 when they heard about the comment, but kept it from her to avoid fuelling the problems even further.Allies of Mr McMahon insisted he was simply unhappy about the pictures selected for a leaflet. Sources also told the Guardian that Ms Rayner was seen by the leader\u0027s aides as a \u0027working-class oik and a bit thick\u0027 who doesn\u0027t fit their \u0027patronising Camden style\u0027. Another Labour source, without loyalties to Ms Rayner, told the paper:  \u0027It\u0027s a clear mistake to fire someone who speaks like the people we need to talk to. It\u0027s a huge mistake from a bunch of snobs who don\u0027t like how she speaks.\u0027 Mr Burham - who fuelled talk of leadership ambitions over the weekend when he said he was ready to pick up the phone if the party needed him - said this morning that Ms Rayner\u0027s treatment was not \u0027right\u0027.\u0027I didn\u0027t like the way that was handled, I\u0027ll be honest, and I didn\u0027t see why we were getting a negative story on Saturday night when myself and Steve Rotheram and other people around the country had good victories to celebrate, so that wasn\u0027t right, but I don\u0027t think the way Angela was treated was right,\u0027 he said.\u0027But it\u0027s been resolved and we move on from this morning. There\u0027s a shadow cabinet in place now.\u0027I hope that they are getting on with the job in exactly the same way that I am getting on with the job.\u0027Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Sir Keir had tried to make Mrs Rayner \u0027carry the can for the poor results at the weekend\u0027.\u0027It does seem as if, certainly the people around him (Sir Keir Starmer), don\u0027t understand how the party works,\u0027 the former shadow home secretary told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.\u0027They tried to sack Angela Rayner in order to make her carry the can for the poor results at the weekend.\u0027They didn\u0027t seem to realise that because she\u0027s an elected deputy leader, you can fiddle around with her title, but you can\u0027t sack her, she remains a senior person in the shadow cabinet.\u0027When asked if it was the view of deputy leader Ms Rayner that Sir Keir wanted to sack her, Ms Abbott said: \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what all the briefing was about."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris hails step freedom coronavirus lockdown","story":"Share this articleYou will have to quarantine at home for ten days on your return and take a PCR test on days two and eight - as well as a lateral flow test before the return flight.Or there is an alternative option that you could pay for an additional \u0027Test to Release\u0027 on day five to end self-isolation early.

That’s the highest reading since February 2000, suggesting broad confidence that the economic picture is improving. ZEW’s assessment of the current economic situation for Germany also improved, although remained in negative territory - rising from -48.8 to -40.1.  ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach says the economic outlook appears to be improving considerably. Germany’s economy contracted in the first quarter of 2021, under the latest lockdown. But economists predict it is returning to growth. It is also relaxing its Covid-19 restrictions for people who have been fully vaccinated, or recovered from the virus they won’t be subject to curfews or restrictions on social gatherings.Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, says investors are concerned that tech stocks may have soared too high: That report also cited other possible threats: “High market concentration, changes in the tax code, rising interest rates and lofty valuations” could all be potential risks to the FAAMG sector (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and GoogleAlphabet), as CNBC explains here. That drags the blue-chip index away from its recent 14-month highs, and back below the 7,000 point mark, which it hit last month for the first time since the pandemic. Neil Wilson of Markets says “the risk-off tone” is spreading through the whole market. It’s not just a tech selloff, even though it began with the Nasdaq’s fall last night. He also agrees that inflation worries are weighing on the market -- with the jump in Chinese factory gate prices showing that cost pressures are building. Potts has also told reporters that people will want to celebrate this summer, at events such as the postponed Euro 2020 football tournament, as the pandemic eases. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, say: Aslam argues, though, that the economic picture is brightening: Every sector of the Stoxx 600 is in the red, with travel and leisure firms, technology companies, and miners all hit hard. Reuters has more details: National Bureau of Statistics statistician Dong Lijuan explained: The jump in the PPI underlines why some economists are worried about rising inflation.  Stocks are sliding today as rising inflation worries, and a fall in tech stocks, send investors running for cover. Anxiety that rising commodity prices could push inflation sharply higher, as some economies reopen from the pandemic, is one factor. Iron ore and copper both hit record highs this month, putting pressure on manufacturers as they try to obtain raw materials. Tech stocks are also suffering from the rotation into ‘value stocks’ -- firms badly hit by the pandemic, whose sales and profits should improve as economies reopen.  In a more inflationary world, companies with low (or no) profits today, but high hopes for the future, are less attractive. Last Friday’s disappointing US employment report also continues to reverberate around the markets. One theory is that hiring was so weak (just 266,000 new jobs), because of labor shortages - a mismatch between supply and demand. If so, bosses may need to raise wages to attract back workers. Chris Weston of Pepperstone explains: AstraZeneca faces a bruising clash with investors at its annual meeting today, with a protest vote expected against CEO Pascal Soriot’s pay packet.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

And, on the subject of taking stock, the Institute for Government has published a report today (pdf) on how well the government is doing in terms of keeping its manifesto promises. The verdict is mixed. It says that, out of 287 manifesto commitments, the government has completed or is in track with around half of them. And on another quarter it is making progress. But the report also says that the government will struggle to fulfil some of its key pledges. It says: Here is the agenda for the day. 11.25am: The Queen’s delivers the Queen’s speech at the state opening of parliament. 12.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, holds a coronavirus briefing. Lunchtime: Downing Street is due to hold its daily lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson speak at the start of the debate on the Queen’s speech. But, as is traditional, the two government backbenchers will open the debate by proposing and seconding the loyal address. Shailesh Vara and Katherine Fletcher have been selected, and their speeches are primarily expected to be entertaining. 2.30pm: Johnny Mercer, who recently resigned as a defence minister over protection for veterans from prosecution, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee. 4pm: The financier Lex Greensill gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 4pm: Cressida Dick, commissioner of the politan police, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the policing of the Sarah Everard memorial.

Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Photograph: GettyIreland was transformed as a society by the introduction of free second-level education more than 50 years ago. It enabled children to build careers based on the pen rather than the shovel, but left in its wake an unhealthy focus on the third-level academic pathway as the preferred option of the vast majority of parents for their children.For those who followed the third-level route or who did not have the opportunity to do so, the desire to see their children follow that path remains a very powerful driver of how our post second-level education system is structured.These parents now want their own children to progress automatically up through higher education to honours degree, masters and PhD levels.The unquestioning belief in Ireland that academic success directly relates to career success makes any option other than securing a CAO place in a third-level institution unacceptable to many.The figures are impressive at first sight. More than 90 per cent of children remain in full-time education to Leaving Cert. Eighty per cent of that number aspire to a college place through the CAO every year and more than 65 per cent of each year’s cohort progresses on to colleges through that route, making Ireland among the highest participants at third-level in the entire OECD.Making the right match Many of those students who achieve modest Leaving Cert point scores (300 points or fewer) and who progress into CAO courses will end up dropping out of college.As their Leaving Cert results may have indicated, many were not suited to academic learning in secondary school and the general academic routine associated with third-level may have been mismatched with their natural learning style.Our third-level system is constructed to reward linguistic ability. Students are encouraged to use words effectively and will often have highly developed auditory skills, they will think in words, will like reading, play word games and compose poetry or stories.Third-level also rewards logical mathematical reasoning, abstract and conceptual thinking and those who are able to see and explore patterns and relationships and can form concepts before tackling the details.So, what about those young people who have struggled with linguistic and mathematical subjects in our academically-orientated second-level Leaving Cert system?Would they not be better served progressing their learning in an environment where other learning styles are the medium through which teaching and learning take place?This is where our system of further education (FE) and enhanced and expanding apprenticeship programmes (where ongoing training and part-time study are built into the job) come into their own.These routes from school into adult life provide many options for the tens of thousands of young learners who wish to develop their abilities and skills in a way that is best suited to them.For a significant cohort of those leaving second-level schools each year the option of studying for a QQI level-five or six award at the local FE college or starting an apprenticeship, which mixes working in employment alongside study, is by far the most appropriate choice, even if a CAO place happens to be available to them.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris is currently promoting a hugely expanded range of options on offer through the apprenticeship route.But for his initiative to succeed there will have to be a major change in the outlook of Irish society regarding the relationship between educationtraining and social class status.We are not Germany. Ireland does not have a history of developing a high-skilled apprenticeship-rooted workforce that is recognised to be of equal standing to those who progress their careers through traditional universities.Previously, Ireland’s further-education sector was commonly perceived to be the place where students who did not succeed at the Leaving Cert gravitated towards the following year.If that was ever true, it is far from the truth today. Data provided by our third-level institutions show far higher retention rates among FE graduates.Small class sizes in the FE sector, alongside the project-based assessment methods, along with the prevalence of work placements with local employers, are particularly suitable to large numbers of our young people.Many programmes are designed in conjunction with local employers and are attuned to the employers’ needs. Therefore, the skills developed during the course are relevant to both the local and wider labour market.Further-education courses are provided in colleges throughout the entire country through the country’s network of education and training boards (ETBs).They offer courses that are designed to consolidate the learning of those who excel in disciplines such as science, business and art, but who may need the year to acquire the skills to navigate their way successfully through a more formal degree programme in their area of interest at university or at an IT.Up to 20 per cent of places in many of the highest CAO points score courses in the country are reserved for graduates of FE courses each year and see applicants securing places and thriving in those courses even though 12 months previously they were hundreds of CAO points short of the required entry score.Apart from those who now use FE as a back door to college, many other FE courses are designed to prepare students to enter directly into high-quality employment immediately on completion of their one- or two-year course.The links between FE courses and CAO programmes, where reserved places are allocated to students based on the quality of their award, are available through careersportal.ie. Details of every FE course on offer in Ireland are available through the qualifax.ie website.Solas is the national co-ordinating body for apprenticeships in Ireland. In the past few years it has been working to rebuild our traditional apprenticeships and develop a whole range of new courses across all sectors of the economy.Apprenticeships have been traditionally associated with the construction and motor industries and with young men. They have provided high-quality training and employment opportunities for generations of learners.Following the crash in 2008 the entire construction sector, and to a lesser extent the motor industry, fell apart and the apprenticeship route practically disappeared as an option for school leavers from 2009-2016.Thankfully, the construction industry was rapidly recovering, until Covid-19 put it into hibernation for long periods over the past 15 months.But with the recent resumption of economic activity and the Government’s programme of home completions, careers in construction offer a very bright future to those with an interest in the industry.Many of our existing apprenticeships are world-class. People often extol the virtues of the German and Swiss systems and that is completely justified, but Irish apprentices are also well regarded abroad, and Ireland consistently does well at WorldSkills competitions, the skills Olympics.Beyond the traditional apprenticeships, numbers are set to double to 10,000 a year under a new five-year Government plan aimed at boosting “earn and learn” options for school leavers.The range of apprenticeships is set to broaden to include dozens of new roles in green skills such as wind turbine maintenance and white-collar areas such as international financial services, software and aircraft asset management.The Minister said the new plan was a big opportunity for “cultural change” around the status of apprenticeships.“These aren’t just alternatives to colleges,” he said. “They are, in many cases, an alternative way of doing college which offers a degree at the end of it. It’s not just about plumbing and building any more you can also be a quantity surveyor or engineer if you want.”A new healthcare assistant apprenticeship is expected to be especially popular, and there are roles too in farming (applied horticulture, farm management, farm technician), construction (roofing, scaffolding, quantity surveying) and leisure (sports turf management).Under the action plan, public-sector bodies will also be asked to dramatically boost the number of apprentices in local authorities, the Civil Service and other State-funded bodies.The aim is to increase public-sector apprentice numbers from about 100 to 750 in areas such as built heritage, ICT and healthcare.We need to embrace the ersity of opportunity now on offer and overcome our obsession with one specific model offered by university education.Studying in Europe after an FE Award Much publicity has been given over recent years to the growth of degree programmes taught through English in western European traditional universities, and universities of applied sciences, particularly in the Netherlands.What is less well known is that the universities of applied sciences are more than happy to offer places to Irish FE students based on their level-five and six awards.I recently met two Irish students who are progressing successfully through physiotherapy degrees in two Dutch universities of applied sciences.The EU programmes taught through English which offer places to those holding FE awards are available on eunicas.ie."},{"url":null,"title":"it s time to decide on your college course choices for 2021","story":"In-depth research into the course you wish to study, along with where you want to study it, are key to third-level success. File photograph: iStockIn-depth research into the course you wish to study, along with where you want to study it, are key to third-level success. File photograph: iStockWith all the uncertainty that Leaving Cert students have experienced over these past two academic years many will be looking forward to starting college in the autumn. If you are one of these students, now is the time to turn to that final list of CAO course choices, which must be submitted to the CAO by 5.15pm on July 1st.Securing a degree at the end of three or four years of study will be a major achievement, but you will only manage it if you are determined and focused on its course content from day one.Unfortunately, every year, many students make avoidable mistakes when applying. Thousands apply to the CAO to go to a particular college only because it is where their friends are planning to attend, while others will apply for courses without conducting any serious or detailed research.Once the reality of what’s involved in completing the programme dawns on them, many will end up dropping out of their courses before Christmas.In most cases, college is a three or four-year long journey. Would you start a marathon on a whim? Absolutely not such a task requires months of training and planning. Selecting a college course requires the same level of planning and commitment.The good news is that it is not too late. Now is the time to act. If you think you might be one of these people, you have just over a month to rectify the situation.By now, you will no doubt be aware of the course options available to you depending of course on how you perform in the forthcoming assessed grades process undertaken by your teachers, and in the written papers you choose to sit in June.If not, Qualifax has details of every course that is on offer, and its advanced search facility will enable you to refine your search to the subjects that genuinely interest you.Litmus test  The litmus test is what will motivate you to get out of bed on a cold morning next winter, when nobody will be checking whether you do so or not, to attend lectures, study the topics in the library, write the assignments that such research will generate, and then pass your first-year exams next May.All of this is of course contingent on how colleges organise the delivery of their programmes in the post Covid-19 world in September. There is a huge level of determination among all those involved in the delivery of further and third-level sectors to make the next academic year a face-to-face one for most students.Select a suitable course  If you think you will not have enough CAO points to get a place on your preferred course there are plenty of other opportunities. Look at other options farther afield in Europe and elsewhere, where smaller college-age populations and more developed third-level sectors often mean lower points requirements.You should also research local Further Education (FE) Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) options, which may have reserved places on your preferred course, meaning you could secure a place on the programme in September 2022.Even if you are perfectly happy with your original course choices, it is wise to review them. Courses are discontinued all the time, and colleges often add new courses to the CAO system. Dozens of courses on offer in May 2021 did not exist when the CAO printed its handbook last summer. Explore them now.Between now and July 1st, log on to your account on cao.ie and see what courses you have listed, and in what order. For the courses you have listed, study the full content of each year’s lectures and how they might allow you to progress to employment or postgraduate opportunities on qualifax.ie.Technological change Technological change is rapidly reshaping the nature of work, and a degree completed in 2026 or 2027 could open opportunities in the labour market that have not yet been envisaged. So, don’t worry about it now just get your course choices right over the next few weeks.What happens if you choose the wrong course?  If you end up accepting a course that is not right for you when the colleges offer their places in August – be it because you do not like the curriculum, you did not research the content thoroughly or you realise that you have selected a course you have no interest in – you may end up dropping out during the academic year or failing the exams.If either happens and you decide to return to college the following year to study another course, you will have to pay another registration fee of €3,000 in 2022.You will also have to fork out the course fee of at least €8,000 that the Department of Education will pay the college on your behalf this year.The Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the State, will pay course fees only once for each year of an approved course.If you repeat a year, you will be the one paying. This extra €8,000 would bring your total fee for your first year to at least €11,000. This is far beyond the means of many families, especially when you factor in the living costs of attending college.Even if you choose a course at a private college this year, then leave it to follow one in a State-funded college next year, you must still pay the full fees. Fees paid to private colleges are tax deductible at 20 per cent on any charges over €3,000, and so are treated in the same way as State-funded places, even if you do not claim the tax relief.Things to check Make sure you meet all the entry requirements and have taken the required subjects at the appropriate level. An example of this is the higher-level maths requirement for level eight engineering degrees. With this list in hand, put your courses in an order of preference or priority.The coming month will be one of the most intensive periods of engagement between colleges and prospective students. Colleges will facilitate, within Covid-19 restrictions, inidual interactions with staff via online communication or virtual open days.You can use these forums to discuss any programme you are seriously considering. Contact the course director or programme office you will find phone numbers and email addresses in the college prospectus or on the college website.When you have completed this process, list your final course choices on your CAO record in the order you want them, allowing for all possible outcomes from your assessed grades.You have up to 10 choices at both level eight higher degrees and level seven and six ordinary degrees and higher-certificate programmes.Never disregard the level seven and six courses out of academic snobbery: almost all these programmes allow you to progress to the level eight higher degree with an additional year of study.Do not finalise your choices without consulting the key adults in your life, such as your parents, your s, and guidance counsellor. Your guidance counsellor and teachers will continue in the weeks ahead to work with you to help finalise your course choices. Make sure to use their expertise before you submit your course lists."},{"url":null,"title":"the secret teacher must we go back to state exams as we know them next year","story":"The new junior cycle has been akin to the toddler who keeps bumping into things and cannot quite get sturdy on its legs. It has gathered far more doubters than believers. Photograph: iStockWith the new style in-house Leaving Cert grades very much on my mind, I’ve been trying to establish how much past data and how much future speculation I’m permitted to use as I calculate andor predict.I find it entertaining to observe whether fellow teachers refer to the in-house grades as “predicted” (future orientation, surely?) or “calculated” (past orientation, surely?), as this might reveal what will inform their grades.Many things have changed since last year and yet many things have remained the same. A new company has been appointed to oversee the process and there’s a new algorithm. Nobody quite knows whether to lament or celebrate this. A case of “better the devil you know”, perhaps? The students are way ahead of us all: they tell me not to worry too much. “It’s all designed so the marks won’t be too high this year,” says one particularly outspoken young man. “You might very well think that I couldn’t possibly comment,” I reply.“I LOVE Kevin Spacey, ” shouts another student, recognising the Francis Urquhart quote and we drift into talk of Netflix, which only comes to a (hasty) close because one of them asks me if I have seen Sex Education. I have. But this isn’t SPHE.DeprivedFor all its flaws the Leaving Certificate has been the cornerstone of Irish education for decades. Talk of reform never came to anything, and then in 2020 we were propelled into finding an emergency alternative. This year it’s less of an emergency but still very much an alternative to the main, live event as we have known it. This two-year hiatus has massive consequences for any formal and paced reform. The Leaving Cert cohorts of 2020 and 2021 will progress through the ranks of post-secondary life deprived in some ways, but perhaps richer in many more as a result of the especially challenging time endured in late teens.But it is the Intermediate Certificate, later the Junior Certificate, that may hold the key here. It may not have qualified as high currency in terms of an academic passport but it proved a great real-time motivator for students throughout the early years of secondary school. State exams ensured that they had a frame of reference for learning and developing studyrevision structures with a view to being formally assessed.I’ve seen many students give their all to the Junior Certificate to be rewarded with a clean sweep of top grades. Others took it handy to walk away relatively empty-handed. Of those who aced it, some became complacent and did less well when it mattered more. Others kept up a “winning streak” approach for the Leaving Cert. Those who were disappointed with their Junior Certificate results didn’t forget that feeling easily, and it served as a powerful motivator in senior cycle. The tables were often turned between Junior Cert and Leaving Cert and this taught students valuable lessons – about both learning and life.We are on a real break from formal State exams as we have previously known them. Do they have to resume as soon as it is physically possible? I would argue that they don’t, even that they shouldn’t.We have here a real opportunity to conduct proper reform – perhaps unlike any our education system has ever seen. Full consultation with all stakeholders. Proper piloting. Review and evaluation of the pilot phase in order that the finished product can be rolled out in a timely manner when it is ready. Why can’t this happen? The benefits are obvious: a thorough and well-paced reform process would truly transform what Ireland’s education system can offer its young people.The new junior cycle has been akin to the toddler who keeps bumping into things and cannot quite get sturdy on its legs. It has gathered far more doubters than believers. In its fragile infancy it needed to gain real traction, and these Covid years have meant that an increasing number of subjects have never been examined formally.On a national scale the CBAs (classroom-based assessments) have simply never taken off properly. Perhaps they have been embraced locally here and there, depending on the subject and the collective willingness or enthusiasm of a department. My one personal journey through CBAs goes something like this: first I drowned out the begrudgers to embrace CBAs and give them a fair chance (I genuinely saw potential). I enthused the students only to discover that they had already picked up on the anti-CBA vibes, so I had my work cut out for me.Slacking offMy colleagues in the department were great and we had some genuinely positive experiences, but seeing the benefits of the time spent on CBAs proved a problem. We weren’t covering as much material as we normally would and it became hard to justify this. Lack of reform at Leaving Certificate level meant it became increasingly difficult to make choices in junior cycle, which we felt would potentially disadvantage our students pedagogically later.And then came the deal-breaker: students started visibly slacking off. Why? Because they were getting superb feedback from other subjects in their CBAs and getting it relatively effortlessly. The students didn’t find CBAs hard work they were time out from the pressures of more formal and challenging assessments. Had this really been the plan? Not unlike with the Leaving Certificate in-house grades, I’m not sure where I am.What I do know is that the credibility of the new junior cycle, which was proving seriously difficult to build anyway, is well and truly compromised by the non-event assessments in 2020 and 2021. Past and present combined mean we can both calculate and predict challenging times at that level."},{"url":null,"title":"universities prepare for return to campus","story":"Trinity College Dublin before the pandemic. The danger posed by possible Covid variants means that students should be prepared for further disruption such as the cancellation or postponement of lectures and labs.As the Government continues\u0026nbspthe planned summer reopening of the country Leaving Certificate pupils and third-level institutions will be looking a little further ahead to what college might look like when the doors open in September.Life for students at third level is likely to be very different this year when compared with the pre-Covid in-class model but many will still be hoping for a return to some degree of normality. Everything will of course be contingent on what the public-health guidance is in the autumn and it is too soon to rule out further disruption as a result of the health crisis.That said, Ireland’s third-level colleges and universities have been planning for a return to campus for quite some time now and a lot of work has been put into ensuring a safe return for students and staff.It hasn’t been easy. Last year was the most challenging faced by the education sector since the foundation of the State. Academic programmes had to be adapted to utilise new learning techniques, while students experienced severe disruption surrounding their studies and end-of-year exams.The pandemic prompted a speedy take-up among students and institutions of virtual learning platforms, allowing students to view lectures, participate in class discussions and engage in group work remotely.Of course, many colleges and further-education institutions had already adopted these platforms but their use varied from institution to institution. Whatever the arrangements this autumn, the benefits of virtual-learning platforms mean they are here to stay and will continue to feature as a key delivery mechanism for third-level education.Patience and flexibility  Many third-level courses were subject to ongoing review and tweaking over the last 12 months as course organisers and planners learned more about the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery platforms available to them. Students considering changes to their CAO choices should make sure they are up-to-date with the latest developments regarding the course they are interested in.So what should students expect in the autumn? Most colleges are hopeful of some return to the in-person in-class approach but patience and flexibility will be key for students and staff alike.As the vaccination programme accelerates throughout the summer so too will the lifting of restrictions. However, even if students are likely to spend more time on campus than they did last year, it would be a mistake to ignore the safety measures designed to protect them from the virus.The danger posed by possible Covid variants means that students should be prepared for further disruption such as the cancellation or postponement of lectures and labs. Most colleges have a dedicated page on their website outlining the latest advice along with additional information that may be relevant to their institution. It is worth keeping up-to-date with this page.Of course, third-level is not just about achieving\u0026nbspacademic excellence. A well-rounded educational experience is also about personal development and the social experience offered by college life.While students will most likely need to wear face coverings and practise social distancing while on campus, right now hopes are high of a return to some semblance of normality."},{"url":null,"title":"what type of institution should i opt for","story":"For most students, particularly at undergraduate level, colleges, universities, TUs and IoTs all serve the same broad purpose. Photograph: GettyWhat’s in a name? Students working on their CAO form may be familiar with the different terms: university, technological university (TU), institute of technology (IOT) and college. But what do these terms really mean, and should it influence your application in any way?Why is this in the news?The differences between the various institutions were highlighted in a recent report from the Higher Education Authority, which found that college completion rates were highest in the teacher-training colleges, followed by the university sector and then IoTs. What do the four types of institutions have in common?For most students, particularly at undergraduate level, colleges, universities, TUs and IoTs all serve the same broad purpose: providing a third-level education in a particular subject or subject. It’s only when you break it down that you notice the differences.Okay, so what makes an institution into a “university”?Universities are internationally recognised as the highest centre of academic learning - and they generally have higher CAO points requirements.“Practically, universities deal almost exclusively with levels eight (honours degree), level nine (postgraduate degree) and level 10 (doctorate),” says Lia O’Sullivan, head of communications with the Irish Universities Association. “Institutes of technology and technological universities cater for a significant population of level six and level seven qualifications as well. The seven IUA universities (UCC, UL, NUIG, Maynooth, DCU, Trinity and UCD) account for over 75 per cent of all postgraduate courses in Ireland. ”Universities are also different, O’Sullivan says, because they create knowledge through the research of their academics. “They focus on excellence in teaching, learning and cutting-edge research and innovation. They are knowledge creators, not just followers.”O’Sullivan adds that universities are pivotal to the success of the high-end tech and innovation industries in Ireland. “The clusters around the country – medical technology, ICT, biopharma, agri-food and others are all directly linked with the top universities. These industries have sustained the economy and the tax base during the Covid crisis.”Is an institute of technology substantially different?IoTs started off as regional technical colleges, aimed at providing work-ready graduates with links to local industry. These RTCs evolved into IoTs and, today, provide a crucial educational training ground for students that may not be able - or want – to go to university in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway.Róisín O’Connell is head of communication at the Technological Higher Education Association (THEA), which represents and advocates for the technological higher education sector in Ireland. “Lecturers in the technological sector may have been coming from industry rather than academia,” she says. “Guest lecturers may also have strong links with industry and there are good links with local industry – a good example here being the steady stream of graduates from IT Carlow into the aviation industry.”O’Connell says that IoTs are less urban-based than universities. “Letterfrack, part of GMIT, is where students learn furniture design and manufacturing, and these courses provide specific graduates for certain industries.”What if I don’t want to do a degree but would prefer an apprenticeship?You’re in luck. Over the past decade, a whole host of new apprenticeships have come on stream. While craft apprenticeships including carpentry, motor mechanic and plumbing are still among the core offerings, students can also now train in accounting, auctioneering, insurance, recruitment, ICT, sales, logistics, food and hospitality and more. Many of these apprenticeships are run through the IoTs and TUs, such as IT Sligo’s insurance practitioner programme, where students spend one day a week at classes and four days working. Unlike a college course where students pay to learn, apprenticeships pay students, so you are earning while you learn. These courses don’t run through the CAO, but you’ll find more info on Apprenticeship.ie.So is a “technological university” a cross between a university and an institute of technology?Ireland’s first technological university, TU Dublin, was established in January 2019 from the merger of the Dublin Institute of Technology, IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown. The second, Munster Technological University, came into existence on January 1, 2021, following the merger of Cork IT and Tralee IT. Part of the reason for the change, at the time, was because the term “institute of technology” was often unfamiliar to international students, whereas everyone knew what a “university” (technological or otherwise) meant. The mergers are also interested to enable better provision of new programmes and bring together academics across a particular discipline so they can better collaborate. Prof David Fitzpatrick, president of TU Dublin, points out that the concept of a technological university is not unique to Ireland. “Technological universities are universities,” he says. “We have moved from a binary system with IoTs to universities to a three-pillar system, and they overlap in terms of what they do. Universities have historically a stronger focus on fundamental and pure research activities, whereas IoTs come from a practice and practically based education approach, but they still do fundamental research. TUs bridge and blur this gap, with a practice and practically based approach to education, and fundamental and applied research activity. We have not lost that local connectivity but we bring the wider regional engagement and strong connectivity with industry across the Dublin region but also nationally and internationally.”Don’t stress about this but, in Ireland, the term “college” generally refers to a higher education institution with a specific focus, such as the teacher training colleges or St Angela’s in Sligo which is best-known for training home economics teachers (although it does run other courses too). The fee-paying, independent colleges including Griffith College and Dublin Business School also fall into this category, as does National College of Ireland and Carlow College which offer specific and focused programmes. Should all of this influence a student’s choice?It’s not something the average student will consider – but there are differences in the type of education that the different types of institution will, says O’Connell. Perhaps the biggest, practical difference is that IoTs and TUs offer level six and seven courses which can be a qualification in their own right or a stepping stone to level eight.The lines between the different institutions is blurrier than before, however, with industry links and work placement options increasing across the board.Turn on, tune in – and drop out?Earlier this year, the HEA revealed that between 60 and 80 per cent of students in some computing and engineering courses were dropping out. The data was collected before the establishment of the Technological University Dublin and the Munster Technological University, with the HEA tracking the 10-year progress of students who entered higher education between 200809 and 201011. The lowest completion rates were in ordinary degree courses (level six and seven) degrees. And whereas 81 per cent of women completed their course, this fell to 70 per cent for men.The data is somewhat dated, however, and it’s worth pointing out that many of those who chose level six and seven computing and engineering courses might otherwise have gone into construction courses, were it not for the property crash. Róisín O’Connell of THEA says that the IoT and TU sectors now offer strong supports to at-risk students including drop-in classes, online supports and maths workshops.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Likewise, real world data shows that the Pfizer vaccine offers 97 per cent protection against mortality after two doses.The new models have also finally factored in the impact the vaccines have of reducing transmission. Previously, they ignored data showing AstraZeneca was reducing transmission by 67 per cent and Pfizer by 75 per cent.SPI-M states in its latest paper: “All scenarios from the three groups lead to another wave, however these are considerably smaller than modelling at Step 2 of the roadmap. “This is primarily the results of new emerging evidence of the extent to which vaccines reduce onward transmission from people who are vaccinated but nevertheless become infected. “At Monday\u0027s press conference, Sir Patrick said: “Over the next month there will be many more people vaccinated.“Everything is pointing to the fact vaccines are a very effective reduction in hospitalisations and deaths. If we carry on without variants we’re definitely pointing in the right direction.”One important feature of the new modelling is that, now, more realistic estimates of the number of people immune to the virus have been used.In a paper dating from March 30, Imperial said that even with optimistic vaccine efficiency, just 44.6 per cent of the population would be protected, through prior disease or the jab, by June 21.The new paper now assumes that the number protected against severe disease by the time restrictions are fully lifted will be 60 per cent. Many experts believe Britain has entered a state of at least partial herd immunity. The modellers have also factored in that people will naturally be more cautious after the pandemic, with many continuing to work from home and levels of contact unlikely to go back to pre-crisis levels in the short term.In February, modellers warned that subsequent waves would cause unsustainable pressure on the NHS. The experts warned that maintaining baseline measures to reduce transmission once restricted are lifted would save many lives and minimise the threat to hospital capacity.Now they have admitted there will be no threat to hospital capacity. The latest paper concludes, that even if there is a resurgence of hospital admissions and deaths, it is highly unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. The link between infections and admissions has now been broken, and up to 90 per cent of people who would have ordinarily ended up in hospital after contracting Covid would no longer be admitted.In Monday\u0027s press conference Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said: “The view of all chief medical officers based on advice is not only that rates are very low in hospital, but that we do not think there is a likelihood in the next period of seeing a significant increase on pressure on the NHS.”In February, LSHTM estimated that schools returning would cause the R number to rise to between 1.1 and 1.5. It didn’t. Imperial also predicted that that the opening of non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality on April 12 would see R rise to 1.2. Yet the latest government estimates suggest that the R value is stable between 0.8 and 1.Although Monday saw a rise in infection rates of 3.1 per cent, tests have risen in the same period by 8.9 per cent. On Monday, the Government moved the Covid-19 alert level from four to three. But it is unclear why it has not been lowered further to two, a designation for when infections and transmission is low.It’s clear we’re now out the tunnel. Even the modellers are in agreement. So let’s speed up the release and celebrate a summer of normality. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive destinations set added travel green list","story":"The British Virgin Islands and a clutch of Caribbean countries are among a limited number of destinations likely be added to the green list for holidays, The  understands.Hopes of a major expansion including popular destinations in France, Spain, Greece or Italy are, however, likely to be dashed when the Government reviews its current list for quarantine-free travel in three weeks.It means any big summer holiday getaway to the continent for Britons is likely to be delayed until July or even August.The nations that could be added next month are the near misses for Friday\u0027s list, which was restricted to 12 countries and territories of which only Portugal, Israel, Iceland and Gibraltar could be described as holiday destinations. Most of the others were remote islands or shut to tourists.Fiji, the Cayman Islands, Grenada, Finland and Malta are other destinations with Covid infection and variant rates low enough to put them on a shortlist for inclusion in Friday\u0027s green list but just missed a place.The British Virgin Islands, a British overseas territory, reopened to tourists on Dec 1 and requires holidaymakers to test upon arrival and quarantine for four days in their hotel or villa. It has had just 216 infections and one death in its 30,000 population since the start of the pandemic.Many Caribbean islands such as Antigua and Barbuda, St Kitts and Nevis and Anguilla are reporting zero or close to zero infection rates. They require tourists to be tested before or on arrival and most are operating bubble policies under which visitors are expected to remain at their designated hotel or beachside villa.The new green list is expected to be decided in the week running up to June 7, when the second phase of destinations will be opened to holidaymakers. It is expected to continue what Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, described as the necessarily cautious reopening of foreign holidays, with Spain, Greece, Italy and France unlikely to feature. It is understood analysis of the data suggests that even the Spanish islands such as the Balearics and Canaries are currently regarded as off limits for British foreign travel.The third set of additions to the green list are expected to coincide with the June 28 review of the Government\u0027s foreign travel policy.This could see changes to the current testing regime under which all holidaymakers returning from green list countries have to take a test within 72 hours of departure and pay for a PCR test on or before the second day of their arrival back in the UK even if they have been fully vaccinated.Michael Gove\u0027s review into vaccination and Covid status passports is considering whether to ease the restrictions for fully-vaccinated travellers, which would allow them to sidestep or reduce the number of tests and quarantine on return from green or amber countries.One ray of hope is the US, with projections by Robert Boyle, a former BA strategist, suggesting it could be eligible for green status by next month provided there is a bilateral agreement for it to drop its ban on foreign travellers.If the infection rate in the US continues to improve at the same pace as it has recently, by then infections will be very similar to the UK, making it even harder to explain why it remains on the \u0027amber list\u0027, he said.Evidence of the pent-up demand for foreign holidays has been revealed by the green listing of Portugal and Gibraltar. EasyJet has increased flights to Gibraltar,  bringing them forward from Edinburgh and adding planes from Gatwick, Bristol and Manchester.British Airways has announced new flights between Newcastle and Faro twice-weekly from May 29, with additional planes from London, Manchester and Edinburgh to the destination.Ryanair is adding 175,000 seats on flights to Portugal over the summer, with extra flights to Faro and Porto from airports including Stansted, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bournemouth, Bristol, East Midlands and Liverpool.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside americas cold case revolution new super effective dna","story":"Convicted killer Ledell Lee protested his innocence up until his death in 2017 by lethal injection at an Arkansas county prison.Lee was accused of strangling and fatally bludgeoning a 26-year-old woman in 1993, but his prints were never found on the murder weapon and testimony putting him at the scene was later discovered to have been flawed.Four years after his death, the state agreed to allow a new test of the DNA evidence from the crime scene that used sophisticated genome sequencing.What it showed was conclusive - they had executed the wrong man. The DNA was not a match for Lee, but another - still unknown - killer.“The investigation into the case remains open due to the possibility of a future database ‘hit’ to the unknown male DNA or unknown fingerprints from the crime scene,” Nina Morrison, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Innocence Project, said in a statement last week.There was no match found in the FBI’s national database, but Lee’s family is hoping that a relatively new forensic technique - which identifies suspects through DNA similarities with relatives - will help finally clear his name.Investigators in the US have had considerable success with it so far. Since identifying in 2018 the so-called Golden State killer, who murdered 13 people and raped dozens in the 1970s and 80s, they have solved more than 50 other cold cases.While the development has been welcomed by the Innocence Project and those fighting for justice for the accused, others have serious concerns about the implications for privacy.Some of the more rudimentary DNA testing is being done by generating a subset of key markers from a person’s DNA code, like an abridged version of a book.But increasingly, investigators are turning to private companies for whole-genome sequencing, which reconstructs a person’s entire DNA code and gives investigators the tools to solve cases much quicker and easier.They then compare the DNA code with data from ancestry sites such as GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA.Unlike state and federal criminal databases, theirs are enormous, including millions of people who have voluntarily uploaded their own genetic information.Many, such as Ancestry and 23andMe, opted not to make them accessible to law enforcement.But data from GEDMatch, a popular website for tracking down lost family members, has helped police find a suspect in a case that reached trial just last week in Florida.Former sailor Thomas Garner, 61, was arrested in March 2019 for the 1984 killing of 25-year-old Pamela Cahanes, his fellow classmate at the Orlando Naval Training Center, after genetic firm Parabon NanoLabs re-tested a semen stain found on Miss Cahanes’ underwear. Further testing on the DNA sample allowed experts at Parabon to create the unknown suspect\u0027s “family tree,” which ultimately led the authorities to Garner.He has now been linked to a second cold-case killing in Hawaii around the same time, in 1982.GEDMatch changed its access policy not long after Garner’s arrest, requiring users to explicitly “opt in” to law enforcement searches. Ethicists said the decision ensured that users would be properly informed about how their profiles would be used.“People using genetic genealogy databases for their own purposes never anticipated this kind of access to their genetic information or that information being used to identify people they’re related to,” said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.There is “a genuine tension between wanting to protect consumers and be respectful of their wishes and recognising that working with law enforcement provides a social benefit,” she said.A recent Baylor College of Medicine survey last year found 91 per cent of respondents favoured law enforcement using consumer DNA databases to solve violent crimes, and 46 per cent for nonviolent crimes.The UK Government has conducted studies looking at how such DNA sequencing would work in Britain, but a decision on the controversial technique is yet to be made.In January of this year, GEDMatch adapted its policy to allow its entire database to be used for forensic searches related to unidentified remains.This gave scientists from the DNA Doe Project their break in identifying the body of an unknown woman in Indiana, thought to have been the victim of a serial killer who was prolific in the 1980s.They had a tiny biological sample, which contained only 0.3 nanograms, or 300 trillionths of a gram, of genetic material.It was first matched with just a handful of distant cousins, but when GEDMatch policy was changed the scientists suddenly found much closer matches which enabled them to identify her as Jenifer Noreen Denton, a 24-year-old mother-of-one from Illinois. They are now working on trying to find her killer.In Lee’s case, the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory has not yet searched the state database, despite being pressed to do so by the Innocence Project and Lee’s family.“We are glad there is new evidence in the national DNA database,” said Patricia Young, Lee’s sister. “We can only remain hopeful that there will be further information uncovered in the future.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to

train company “crass” after it sent out an email to thousands of its employees promising a pay bonus but was actually a “phishing test” to check its cyber security. West Midlands Trains emailed 2,500 of its workers with a message offering a one-off payment as a “gift” to “inspire” them to keep up the “good work” during the pandemic But those who clicked through on the email, sent on behalf of the company’s director Julian Edwards, received a second email informing them it was a “phishing simulation test” designed by the company.  “This was a test designed by our IT team to entice you to click the link and used both the promise of thanks and financial reward,” the email read.  Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) lambasted the exercise as “crass and reprehensible”.  Mr Cortes said: “This was a cynical and shocking stunt by West Midlands Trains, designed to trick employees who have been on the frontline throughout this terrible pandemic – ensuring essential workers were able to travel.“It’s almost beyond belief that they chose to falsely offer a bonus to workers who have done so much in the fight against this virus.”“Our members have made real sacrifices these past 12 months and more. Some WMT staff have caught the disease at work, one has tragically died, and others have placed family members at great risk.”The TSSA has demanded West Midlands “stump up” a real bonus to their employees in recompense for the “needless wrong which has caused so much hurt”. A spokesman for West Midlands Trains confirmed that their employees had not received a bonus.  He said: “We take cyber security very seriously, providing regular training on the subject and we run exercises to test our resilience. “Fraud cost the transport industry billions of pounds every year. This important test was deliberately designed with the sort of language used by real cyber criminals but without the damaging consequences.” In December last year, GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar and web-hosting company, had also duped their employees with an emailed phishing test disguised as a bonus.    The recipients had been promised a $650 one-off payment if they submitted their personal information in response to the email Days later, those who had responded were emailed by the company’s chief security officer informing them they had “failed” the phishing test and would have to retake the company’s Security Awareness Social Engineering training.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tea brake two new japanese zen mobile comes tea ceremony room","story":"A Japanese company has created a car with an unexpected surprise in the boot: a small but perfectly crafted tea ceremony room.The new tea ceremony car contains a raft of authentic details by Kyoto artisans, from tatami mat floor and sliding paper screens to a special alcove for displaying seasonal flower arrangements.Kiwakoto, a Kyoto-based company specialising in bespoke crafted car interiors, was behind the creation of the tea ceremony vehicle, which was made in collaboration with six specialist artisans.The compact space, which took nearly a year to handcraft, measures around one meter wide, 75cm deep and 80cm high – with its diminutive proportions designed to echo the symbolism of humility that goes hand in hand with entering small Japanese tea rooms.“Every single detail and material was made by hand in Kyoto,” Masaru Yoshimura, director of Kiwakoto, told the . “Tea rooms are normally quite small and tiny, so the concept here is exactly the same.”The customised Jimny model car, which taps into a picnic-style type of tea ceremony known as nodate, aims to highlight how tea ceremony-on-wheels can be enjoyed in any location.Japanese tea ceremony, known as sado or chado, is a centuries-old practice deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism, revolving around the ritual of a host preparing powdered green matcha tea for guests, evoking a sense of well-being and harmony in the process.Textiles made by artisans from Kyoto’s Nishijin district, long famed for its kimono craftsmanship, line the ceiling, a sliding paper screen known as shoji separates the tea space from the rest of the car and a wooden alcove known as a tokonoma for a traditional flower arrangement.“We used Japanese sugi cedarwood from forests in northern Kyoto,” he said. “We were extremely particular about using the finest materials – the wood had to show a beautiful, consistent natural grain.”The company came up with the idea for renowned Japanese writer Kundo Koyama last year, after he mentioned on a TV programme that he would like to try out a tea ceremony car in a new model Jimny vehicle.The new car, which is on display in the company’s showroom in Kyoto until May 23, will be used by Koyama and Kiwakoto to highlight both Japan’s tea ceremony culture as well as Kyoto’s dwindling craftsmanship heritage.Referring to the tea ceremony element of the car, Mr Yoshimura added: “Old cultural customs are disappearing in Japan. Craftsmanship is one of them. At Kiwakoto, we specialise in using techniques that can be passed on to future generations.

If it gives its go ahead at a scheduled meeting on Wednesday, vaccinations of children can begin immediately.The authorisation comes after a successful wide-scale trial of the vaccine in which 2,260 volunteers aged 12 to 15 received two doses of either the vaccine or a placebo three weeks apart. There were no cases of Covid-19 among those who received the vaccine, and 18 in those who received the dummy shot. Side effects were comparable to those seen in a similar trial of 16- to 25-year-olds, the FDA found.“This is a watershed moment in our ability to fight back the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr Bill Gruber, a senior vice-president of Pfizer and a paediatric doctor.“We have safety, we got the immune response we wanted, it was actually better than what we saw in the 16 to 25 population, we had outright demonstration of efficacy.”Dr Richard Besser, a former acting director of the CDC, said the authorisation brought him “hope and joy”.“There are now millions more who can be protected from Covid and a lot of hope that this fall school is going to feel a lot more like school should feel like,” he told CNN.Trials continue in children for the Moderna vaccine, the only other two-dose vaccine already approved for adults in the US. Results are expected later in the summer. The FDA said that its regulatory panel would meet again on June 10 to discuss a roadmap for authorising Pfizer vaccines for those under 12.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cricket lawmaker mcc rejects bamboo bats grass not wood","story":"Cricket\u0027s lawmakers the Marylbone Cricket Club (MCC) has rejected that bamboo bats could provide an alternative to willow because bamboo is grass and not wood. In order for bamboo bats to be given the go-ahead, there would need to be an amendment to the laws of cricket. And the MCC has vowed to discuss this at the next laws sub-committee meeting. In a statement, the club said: MCC has read with interest the research study from the University of Cambridge, which suggests that cricket bats made from bamboo offer a more suitable alternative to the traditional use of willow.Currently, Law 5.3.2 states that the blade of the bat must consist solely of wood, so for bamboo (which is a grass) to be considered as a realistic alternative to willow would require a law change.  Importantly, the law would need to be altered to allow bamboo specifically, as even if it were to be recognised as a wood, this would still be illegal under the current Law, which bans lamination of the blade, except in junior bats.MCC’s role as  of the laws includes maintaining the balance between bat and ball, and any potential amendments to the law would need to carefully take this into consideration, particularly the concept of the bat producing greater power.In 2008 the MCC banned bats with a graphite shaft which were being used by professionals and amateur players and in 2017 the lawmakers cracked down on the increasing dimensions of modern bats by imposing a law that meant a bat could be a maximum of 108mm in width, 67mm in depth and 40mm edges.The statement added: Sustainability is a relevant topic for MCC and indeed cricket, and this angle of willow alternatives should also be considered.With the researchers stating that the most suitable types of bamboo grow abundantly across China and that low-cost production could make bamboo bats a viable and ethical alternative to willow, this could provide a pertinent angle for further research and the possibility of reducing the cost of producing bats in different areas of the world.The club will discuss the topic at the next laws sub-committee meeting.The  reported on Monday how a Cambridge University study indicated that a prototype bamboo cricket bat had a larger sweet spot than a traditional willow blade, is stronger, more sustainable and cheaper to produce.The lower cost could boost participation in countries such as India and China which have fewer financial resources, according to the research published in the Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology.The study indicated that bamboo is 22 percent stiffer than willow which increases the speed at which the ball leaves the bat.Researchers said the sweet spot on their prototype performed 19 percent better than that on a traditional willow bat and was closer to the toe.Dr Darshil Shah of Cambridge\u0027s Centre for Natural Material Innovation, who is a former member of Thailand\u0027s under-19 national cricket team, said: This is a batsman\u0027s dream.The sweet spot on a bamboo bat makes it much easier to hit a four off a yorker for starters, but it\u0027s exciting for all kinds of strokes.We\u0027d just need to adjust our technique to make the most of it, and the bat\u0027s design requires a little optimisation too.The investigations included microscopic analysis, video capture technology, computer modelling, compression testing, and testing for vibrations.Players using bamboo bats would not feel any more vibration than with a willow bat, according to the research.The study points out there is a shortage of good-quality willow, which takes up to 15 years to mature - mostly in England - to the point where the wood can be used to make cricket bats.By contrast, the maturing age of Moso bamboo is five to six years and it grows abundantly in China, south-east Asia and South America.Study co-author Ben Tinkler-Davies said: Cricket brings you really close to nature, you spend hours out in the field, but I think the sport can do a lot more for the environment by promoting sustainability.We\u0027ve identified a golden opportunity to achieve that while also helping lower income countries to produce bats at lower cost.The materials used to make cricket bats are regulated by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the sport\u0027s governing body, and rules say the blade shall consist solely of wood.Dr Shah said: Bamboo is a grass not a wood so there would need to be discussions with the MCC, but we think playing with a bamboo bat would be within the spirit of the game because it\u0027s a plant-based material and cane, a type of grass, is already used in the handle.Tradition is really important but think about how much cricket bats, pads, gloves and helmets have already evolved.The width and thickness of bats have changed dramatically over the decades.So if we can go back to having thinner blades but made from bamboo, while improving performance, outreach and sustainability, then why not?The pair tested the sound of leather on bamboo and Mr Tinkler-Davies insisted the frequency is very similar to willow, adding: Whether you\u0027re playing or spectating, you wouldn\u0027t notice much of a difference.Because laminated bamboo is so strong, we\u0027re very confident we can make a bamboo bat light enough, even for today\u0027s fast-scoring, short forms of the game.The researchers hope to enter discussions with the MCC and leading bat manufacturers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown changes full everything you","story":"NewsLockdown changes in full: Everything you can and cant do from May  in EnglandHugging, garden parties, casual sex, holidays and going inside the pub are all on the massive list of roadmap changes from Monday  May in England.

From next Monday, hugging between people from dferent bubbles will be allowed for the first time in  months People will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to  people - up from just six now. And crucially, people from dferent households or bubbles can meet indoors socially for the first time. These indoor gatherings will be limited to six people or a maximum of two households or bubbles - whichever is larger.  That means pubs, bars and restaurants can reopen indoors for the first time since the New Year. But venues will still have to follow social distancing rules and table service only, while masks will remain. Likewise, the legal ban on travel outside the UK will be lted - but there’s still a maze of dferent rules. And school pupils will no longer have to wear masks in class or corridors - but should still get tested twice a week. Boris Johnson told a No press conference it was the biggest single change to lockdown - just as figures show the number of UK cases of the India iant have more than doubled in a week, to . He said it was a “very considerable unlocking” and “there will be a lot of extra movement, a lot of extra contact” as a result. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said deaths should stay low as older people have now mostly been vaccinated, but there is a risk of signicant spread amongst those in the younger age groups. So what can and can’t you do under England’s lockdown changes  Here’s a full rundown from May .You can finally hug loved ones againFrom May , the government will axe guidance in place since March  that says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside their household or bubble. With a third of adults having both vaccine doses, people will instead be told they can choose whether to socially distance from family and close friends. This means people can choose to hug, kiss or shake hands with friends or relatives in the park or in a home.  People do not have to take a lateral flow test before hugging, but it’s one way of reducing the spread of the disease. Likewise people could meet outdoors or with the windows open, or wear masks. There is no limit to the amount of time you can spend with people in a day, or the time spent in a pub or restaurant.Officials say this change is a move towards “living with” coronavirus into the future - and it does NOT mean social distancing rules have been scrapped.Close contact with an infectious person is still the most likely way to catch Covid- and the vaccine is not % effective. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June  - more of this below.  From May , people from dferent households or bubbles will be allowed to meet indoors for the first time since the New Year. This must be in a maximum group of up to six people or two households - whichever is larger. The six-person limit includes babies and children, they’re not exempt. However, this change means that for the first time since January, you can visit family where in England and stay the night .You can have sex with someone you don’t already live withThe indoor meetings ban is being lted, and guidance against any social contact is being eased. Taken together this means casual sex is back on. But people are still being advised to make personal judgements in line with the risks. It doesn’t mean you should go around touching anyone you meet. You can go indoors at pubs and restaurants - in groups of sixThe rule of six indoors applies equally to hospitality venues such as pubs, restaurants and cafes, as it does to private homes. This means they will be allowed to open indoors on May  for the first time since the New Year. As with private homes, there will still be a maximum gathering size of six people or two households at each table. Pubs will also be table service only, so you can’t prop up the bar. You’ll also need to wear a face mask when walking around between tables, and scan in on entry using the NHS Covid- app. But there is no need to order a “substantial meal” with a drink any more.You can have parties of up to  people outdoorsThe current limit of six people for outdoor gatherings will be removed on May . Instead, there will only be a much higher legal limit of  people for outdoor gatherings, except for some organised events as outlined below. This will mean large groups are once again allowed to gather in parks like last summer. You can go on holiday properly in EnglandCurrently, only self-contained holiday accommodation can open in England - and people can only stay with their own bubble. Once you can stay overnight with people from dferent bubbles on May , that means hotels, BBs and other holiday venues like hostels can reopen. England’s domestic tourism industry is allowed to be back in business.You can go on holiday abroad - but it’s severely limitedThe legal ban on taking a holiday outside the UK will be lted on May  and travel will be allowed. However, Brits ing from the vast majority of countries will have to isolate on their , either at home or in a £,-a-head hotel. Only ‘green list’ countries will be exempt from this and there are currently only a tiny handful of countries on the list, including Portugal and Israel. Most of the countries on the UK’s green list still require Brits to isolate when they get to that country, making holiday plans worthless. And evenyou can travel without quarantine at either end, youaposll have to fork out your own money for Covid tests to comply with travel rules. However, restrictions are widely expected to ease quite quickly as we move into June and July. You can stop making your kids wear masks at schoolFace coverings for pupils will no longer be recommended in secondary schools or colleges from May  - either in classrooms or communal areas. Face masks couldin some schoolsthere are local outbreaks, as officials admit some discretion will be needed. Twice weekly home testing for school pupils will remain to control infection rates. You canto university… just in time for the year to endUniversity students on non-practical courses can finallyto in-person teaching and learning from May . That is despite the fact students’ academic years will be over or nearly over by then. All students and staff will be encouraged to take three rapid “lateral flow” tests, supervised on-site, about three to four days apart. They’ll then be expected to test themselves twice a week for the remainder of the term.You can go to a funeral without worrying about a -person limitThe cap on mourners at funerals will be axed ahead of schedule on May . Currently funerals can only have  attendees while wakes are limited to . Instead of a -person limit, venues will decide how many people can attend safely while still keeping up social distancing rules. That means two metres between mourners, or one metre plus mitigations like masks, screens and ventilation - although evidently, hugging is now allowed. Wakes will still have a cap of  people. You can go to a big stadium event or theatre showFans canto sports fixtures in Step Three, with outdoor venues permitted capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is lower. In the largest outdoor seated venues, where crowds can spread out, up to , people will be able to attend, or grounds can be a quarter-full, whichever is fewer. Fans can attend larger performances and sporting events indoors, with capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is fewer. Other events have already been taking place - with bigger crowds and no social distancing - but theyaposre part of a special pilot scheme and people must get negative tests to enter.You can go to a sauna or steam roomGyms and spas were allowed to open at the last stage of the roadmap, but their saunas and steam rooms had to remain shut. Now they can restart - as can indoor group sports and exercise classes, which were restricted to outdoors-only before.You can go to museums and children’s play areasRemaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas, can reopen in Step Three. And so can indoor entertainment, such as museums and children’s play areas.You can go to the cinema - but you have to wear a maskCinemas can finally reopen for the first time in around five months on May . But film-lovers will have to wear masks through the show, unless they are eating or drinking at the time. Perhaps making popcorn-eaters even more annoying. You can go to parent and child groups - and your kids won’t count towards the limitParent and child groups can resume with up to  attendees. And unlike the other caps on gatherings, babies and children under five do not count towards the -person limit in these groups. That means  mums or dads can attend, and take their kids with them.You can have more visitors in a care homeCare home visiting will be eased further, with residents able to have up to five named visitors - up from two now. These named visitors can make regular visits and physical contact, although they should get a negative rapid test and wear PPE before visiting. Residents will also be able to make “low risk” trips outside their home without isolating for  days when they get back - a policy that caused outrage.You CAN’T break social distancing in the pubWider social distancing rules and regulations remain in place - such as in social care, shops and pubs and restaurants. Pubs and restaurants will still have to obey the one-metre-plus rule, where people stay two metres apart or one metre with mitigations like a perspex screen. Laws ordering venue owners to ensure customers are following the rules remain the same, despite the relaxation on hugging within a group.You CAN’T go around hugging everyoneImportantly, the new hugging guidance is aimed at people meeting within legally-allowed group sizes - six indoors,  outdoors. It does not apply to people from two dferent small gatherings hugging, or strangers hugging in the street or a pub. People will be told to exercise their own personal judgement in line with the risks. They will be urged to remain cautious, because some people are more vulnerable to severe illness than others and vaccines do not eliminate the risk from Covid. Boris Johnson said: “This doesn’t mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic we all know close contact such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease.

MPs and members of the House of Lords will have to wear masks throughout unless they are exempt, and everyone present will have to take a Covid test beforehand and only be allowed to attendthey have a negative result.There will  people in the chamber, including the monarch, Charles, Camilla, the Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, representatives from the House of Lords and House of Commons and those involved in the ceremonial procession.There will also be  members of the Lords and  MPs in the Royal Gallery.  And the traditional walk from the Commons to the Lords at the invitation of Black Rod will only be undertaken by a handful of MPs. And most people participating in the ceremony will do so in plain-clothes - rather than the ceremonial robes usually seen at the occasion. Here’s what you can expect to see in the Queen’s Speech - and one thing that almost certainly won’t be in it. Confirmed expected Adult education  The Government will pledge to add “rocket fuel” to their “levelling up” agenda by reforming education and skills training for adults and older teenagers. Under Tory David Cameron, funding for adult education was slashed dramatically.But Downing Street said the promise of a letime skills guarantee will be central to plans for the new parliamentary session as the Government seeks to rebuild the nation after the coronavirus pandemic.Voter ID  The Government has confirmed plans to demand photo ID at polling stations, despite showing no evidence for in-person voter fraud taking place. Boris Johnson has insisted it was complete nonsense to suggest he was trying to supress the votes of those who do not back the Tories by introducing the identication requirement. But . million people lack photo ID, and they tend to come from already underrepresented communities. Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Ministers have confirmed they will bring back the bill - giving police in England and Wales greater powers to shut down protests - after it was shelved in the last session amid violent protests in some parts of the country.  Environment Bill Also confirmed is the commitment to set new, legally-binding environmental targets in the run-up to the international Cop climate change summit in Glasgow at the end of year. Health and Care Bill This is expected to implement planned changes to the the structure of NHS England. Planning bill Expected to ease controls in England as part of a concerted drive to boost housebuilding. Sovereign Borders Bill Expected to overhaul the asylum system in an attempt to deter migrants from crossing the Channel.  Fixed-term Parliaments Act repeal. Ministers have said they will scrap the  legislation brought in by the former coalition government and restore the prerogative power to call early general elections. A Building Safety Bill Expected to bring in a new system of safety regulations and inspections for buildings under construction in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. Prosecution of veterans Legislation is expected to limit future prosecutions of British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Reports suggest it may also cover paramilitaries.

It is understood a consultation will be launched before any legislation is introduced.Government sources have told the BBC it will consider how to protect certain professionals, such as therapists and teachers, and uphold religious freedom such as legitimate forms of pastoral support.The government has been under increasing pressure to act in this area from equality campaigners and some MPs.:Abigail OLearyPM faces fury over dashed hopes for social care plan in speechBoris Johnson faces angry calls to finally deliver on his promise to fix the social care funding crisis after ministers dashed hopes it would feature in todayaposs Queenaposs Speech.The Prime Minister has been warned that more delays will lead to a rocketing number of elderly people desperately in need of support and struggling to pay the bills.Ministers have downplayed suggestions that a full funding package will be published today - instead suggesting millions of elderly people will be left in limbo until later this year.Social care funding is expected to be touched on in the programme of bills but there is unlikely to be any detail - even though Mr Johnson said he had a plan ready almost two years ago.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Families can reunite indoors from Monday as Boris Johnson on Monday confirmed the next relaxation of coronavirus curbs.Hugging relatives and friends will be allowed, though people are urged to use common sense. Announcing that step three of the roadmap will be triggered in England, the Prime Minister said: “This unlocking amounts to a very considerable step on the road back to normality and I am confident we will be able to go further.” But chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said masks may still be needed on public ­transport and it will still be table-service for at least another five weeks for pubs and bars. While more curbs will be relaxed from Monday, May , other restrictions will stay in force for at least another five weeks until June  – the earliest date for triggering Step Four of the unlocking “roadmap”. Here are answers to seven key questions about the remaining restrictions. Why am I still being told to work from homeI can   Some workplaces struggle to make their premises Covid-secure. Many staff would use public transport, where social distancing is much more dficult, to get to their offices. Repealing the “work from homeyou can” advice will inevitably lead to more commuters on buses, trains and trams, creating conditions where the disease likes to spread. Why can’t we have more than six people or one other household in our homes  The more people who gather indoors, the more likely it is that someone will have coronavirus and the more favourable the conditions for transmitting the disease. Depending on the size of your home, six people can fill a living room or lead to it being cramped around a dining table. There is also evidence that the more people there are from dferent families, the more likely it is that caution will be left outside. Why can’t we meet in groups bigger than  outside   Thirty is deemed enough for an exercise class, a ramblers’ group, a local history club or nature reserve members’ club to be able to meet and enjoy themselves without jeopardising safety. Much bigger than that and a gathering becomes a mini-festival. Why can’t I order a pint or pie and chips at the bar  Pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be able to offer table service until at least June . This is a subtle way of regulating numbers and ensuring venues do not become too busy, which would undermine attempts to enforce social distancing. It stops rowdy punters crowding at the bar, shouting at staff and potentially spreading or contracting the virus. People sat at tables are far more spaced out than those packing into pubs where it is standing room only. Why can’t I go clubbing   Clubbing is a pastime mainly enjoyed by younger people – most of whom are not vaccinated and therefore more likely to contract, spread and fall ill from coronavirus. The sheer volume of people and their close proximity to each other would help fuel Covid- transmission. The fact clubbers are usually in drink would also help shed their inhibitions and create a climate for riskier behaviour – potentially helping spread the disease. Why can’t I go to more foreign countries  The “traffic light” regime for international travel unveiled next week takes effect from Monday but is separate from the overall roadmap. Just  nations or territories are deemed green for the restart of non-essential overseas trips, with Portugal the only country that is really popular with British holidaymakers. Experts study a countries’ vaccination and infection rates before deciding on their categorisation. Social contactSix people or two households can mix indoors and groups of up to  outdoors Hugs with close family and friends permitted but caution urged Up to  people can attend weddings and cap on funerals removed Care home residents can have up to five named visitors and more freedom to go out.LeisurePubs, restaurants and cafes can serve people indoors, with social distancing Indoor entertainment, e.g. cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums to reopen Sports stadiums can welcome back fans, subject to crowd limits.TravelHotels, BBs and hostels can reopenInternational travel to “green list” countries can recommence.Education Face masks no longer necessary for secondary school pupils University students can resume in-person teaching.* Changes apply to England only The system exists to prevent importations of coronavirus iants which might jeopardise the success of the UK’s inoculation scheme. More nations will switch from amber, and perhaps even red, to green as the months march on and cases rates dwindle while vaccination levels rise. Reviews will be held every three weeks and the list of potential summer destinations for those desperate for a sunshine break is expected to grow. What about outside England  In Wales, pubs, restaurants, bars and cafés are open outdoors, and from Monday, May  will offer indoor service for tables of up to four people from up to four dferent households. Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafés in Scotland can open outdoors until pm and are permitted to serve alcohol.

The student finance system will be converted into a ‘Lelong Loan Entitlement’, giving all adults access to up to four years of student loans. The government said the loans will be available to be used flexibly across their letime, full- or part-time, for university or technical skills. Higher education has been left unaffordable for many after tuition fees tripled under the Tories to more than £, a year. That has left graduates with tens of thousands of pounds of loans, many of which will never be paid back in full. Instead they are forced to pay a percentage of their salary above a certain threshold until the loans are written off decades later.  The government has not set out exactly when the new system will be introduced, how much it will cost or exactly what it will look like.But Boris Johnson claimed new laws will be rocket fuel for his levelling-up agenda, which has had a slow start almost two years after he entered No.No  said new laws will create a post- and adult education and training system that is fit for the future. Other proposals include giving employers a statutory role in planning publicly funded training programmes through askills accelerator programme. Ahead of the speech, Mr Johnson said: These new laws are the rocket fuel that we need to level up this country and ensure equal opportunities for all. We know that having the right skills and training is the route to better, well-paid jobs. Iaposm revolutionising the system so we can move past the outdated notion that there is only one route up the career ladder, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to retrain or upskill at any point in their lives.

The Mansfield MP stood as a councillor in Nottinghamshire in Thursday’s local elections. And today he was elected leader of the council - usually a full-time job in itself. Labour MPs in the area have questioned whether he would be claiming the full-time salary allowance for doing the job part-time.Mr Bradley claimed holding the two roles might not be as unprecedented as people might suggest. While a number of MPs have retained council seats - the Mirror has found no record of an MP being elected as a councillor and then as council leader while sitting in the Commons.Mr Bradley, who was appointed a youth tsar under Theresa May, made headlines in  after he was forced to apologise for an online post suggesting the unemployed get vasectomies.He said today: Any minister in Government is both a constituency MP and also has a huge additional responsibility, Matt Hancock runs a £ billion department as well as being a constituency MP. If you consider it that way in terms of the time pressures, I donapost think itaposs as unprecedented as people might think. There are no other county councillors in the country who can just go and knock on the door of the relevant minister, and I hope thataposs useful in terms of delivery. Labour MPs Lilian Greenwood and Nadia Whittome used Twitter to criticise Mr Bradleyaposs new role.Ms Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, said: Another MP with a lucrative second job. And this one comes with potential conflicts of interest. Nottingham South MP Ms Greenwood also took to Twitter to say: Surely he wonapost be claiming the full-time salary allowance for doing the job part-time  Mr Bradley also faced criticism from Labouraposs leader of Nottingham City Council, David Mellen, who tweeted: Being a Council Leader is very much a full time job, as is being a Member of Parliament. How could anyone do both jobs at the same time  Responding to the comments, Mr Bradley said: I obviously feel it is possible or I wouldnapost be here doing it. The Prime Minister is also a constituency MP - clearly he has to manage both jobs and he has an incredibly busy job alongside being a constituency MP, so as I say, I donapost think itaposs as unprecedented in terms of splitting that time as people might suggest. The thing for me here is, rather than go down and want to climb the career ladder in Westminster, Iaposve chosen to spend my time here in the county. But you know what, Iaposm at the mercy here of my group here at County Hall -Iaposm proved wrong andI canapost manage these things, then they will no doubt pick somebody .  Mr Bradley continued: This particular arrangement is untried and untested and I think we should take that opportunity and see what it can bring. Iaposm confident it can be beneficial but weaposll make that assessment anditaposs not then we can change it. Mr Bradley said his move to become leader of the county council was part of his decision to concentrate my time locally - which he cited as his part of his reason for stepping down as a Parliamentary Private Secretarylast year. He said: I intend to commit all of that additional time and energy that I could have spent down in Whitehall as a minister, here in the county delivering. I think there is a flexible approach to this - and particularly now, as weaposve seen over the course of the last year, we all know you do not have to be physically in a place in order to meet people and contribute to things. Iaposve no doubt at some stage,this is successful andIaposm lucky enough to be here for the full duration of this term, then there will be occasions where I will have to say aposIaposm going to this and not thatapos. In any leadership role or any management role, that is the case - you have to prioritise.

Two weeks ago on April  more than half of the areas in England saw their case rate rise.Despite this coronavirus hospitalisations and deaths continue to be on a downwards trajectory however, in no small part due to the coronavirus vaccine rollout - which signicantly reduces the risk of death.

Steve Phillip has spoken of the regret he feels for not trying to help his son Jordan more in the years before his death. On December ,  Steve texted the -year-old to ask himhe wanted to chat. Jordan turned down the offer, explaining that he was a bit tired and askingthey could catch up another time. The next day Jordanaposs girlfriend Charlotte called Steve saying she had ed to his Harrogate home ed to find him dead.Do you have a story to share  Email webnews@mirror Speaking during Mental Health Awareness week, the devastated dad recalled the moment his world was torn apart. Charlotte said aposHi Steve, I’m so sorry, I’m so, so sorry, it’s Jordan…………….. he’s killed himselfapos, Steve said. “The call duration is logged at  minutes, I can’t tell you what I said or what Charlotte said for the remaining  minute and  seconds. “But that day, my beautul -year-old son took his own le – Charlotte found him, with the help of a neighbour who smashed the front window of Jordan’s house to help her get in. “You always think these things won’t come knocking on your door, “It happens to other people” and then one day your world is shattered into a million pieces. In  there were , registered deaths by suicide in England and Wales, equating to an average of  suicides per day. Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under the age of  in the country. When Jordan became part of those statistics his family were completely rocked to their cores. “In the days after we lost him, we huddled together as a family, sitting mainly in silence for the first few days and we cried a lot, Steve continued. “ hours before he left us, Jordan and I were texting each other. We’d been to a whisky tasting event a week before, and before that a concert together to watch one of our favourite bands, Hootie and the Blowfish. “In the hours leading up to him taking his own le, I was delivering a social media training workshop in Solihull which was a three-hour drive home in heavy traffic.  “The day before the workshop, Jordan and I suggested that we’d speak later that day, but after arriving at my Solihill hotel room later that evening, we decided we’d catch up another time as it was late and Jordan was tired. “I could have done better, I could have been less busy, I could have insisted we speak or just simply called him…….I didn’t. These are my torments but inside, part of me knows he knew we cared, we did do as much as Jordan would let us do. “What I mean is, Jordan chose to protect us from his worst torments, and we felt thatwe pushed too much he would pull further away. Hindsight is a wonderful thing they say. In the aftermath of his death Jordanaposs family have taken solace in what a well loved man he was. He adds: “Jordan was a son, a brother, a stepson, a stepbrother, a loving boyfriend, a grandson, an uncle, a cousin and a best friend. He was tall and handsome and turned many a head, male and female. “His friends both loved and envied him. At his funeral they described Jordan as well-mannered, a great listener, kind and considerate, intelligent, cool but humble, ridiculously handsome, a true gentleman, humorous. “Jordan was the kind of person who would stop and chat to homeless people and to local strangers – only a few days before he left us, he’d stopped to speak with an elderly lady who was sweeping leaves from the public pathway in front of her house. He told her what a good job she was doing. “Jordan was also strong – he’d battled with severe depression for many years. “He loved his family and his friends so much that he would often protect them from the ultimate depths of his despair, but he was always there for them, no matter how dficult his day was. “There was nothing selfish about Jordan, not even at the moment he chose to end his pain in December , when he took the time to write notes to his girlfriend Charlotte and his family to let us know that he loved us.

The Mirror found scores of Romanians among the tens of thousands of people crossing the fast-flowing Rio Grande from Mexico into the States. Their perilous trek involves walking through the notorious city of Miguel Aleman, across the river from Roma, Texas, where we heard constant heavy gunfire between the rival Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas crime gangs. Every night for a week the Mirror watched thousands delivered by the inflatable boatload on to US soil. Among them were Europeans who no longer felt able to make it to the UK, their intended destination, after Britain left the EU.They have seized on US President Joe Biden ’s relaxation of predecessor Donald Trump ’s ruthless border policy, flying from countries such as Romania and Latvia to Mexico before crossing the Rio Grande.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Border agents patrolling the river confirmed that they have seen an influx of Europeans since January , when the UK split from the EU. One said: “Both America and Britain offer a similar safe le to these people. But given the choice of crossing the English Channel with children and babies or being rowed  yards across the Rio Grande in a rubber boat, I guess they feel we [America] are now a safer option.“We all think Brexit is responsible, for sure. Most Europeans are flying through Paris into places like Cancun [in Mexico] and then making their way here.“Ever since the beginning of February, we have seen the numbers increase.  “Because of Covid and the restrictions in Europe, it’s the path they have to take.” Since Brexit, Romanians wanting to live and work in the UK must apply for a visa under a points-based immigration system. They must speak English to the required standard and have a job offer. In  Romanians overtook the Irish and Indians as the second biggest immigrant community after Poles in the UK. However, they are now among the most vulnerable in Britain after Brexit, according to the East European Resource Centre – and some now see the UK as an unwelcoming place.  Over  years after the death of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and despite record % growth last year, communism has cast a long shadow over Romania and the country remains the second poorest EU member. And since Brexit, Romanians seeking a better le where have found the once-easy access to the UK now closed. One Romanian migrant, Sirbu Funeriu, , arrived in the US with his we Cristina and two children aged  months and five years. They were picked up by US Border Patrol after paying £, to the cartels to take them across the Rio Grande.  Engineer Sirbu said they had left their home in Ghimbav, near Brasov, on April , and flown to Mexico via Paris. He explained that two years ago they planned to move to the UK, but Brexit put paid to their plans as they felt there would be animosity towards them. After crossing into the US they were picked up and are now being processed while being held in a detainment centre. Just weeks after Mr Biden took office, the number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border began to soar, overwhelming the federal government’s resources and resulting in a scramble to find enough shelter space to accommodate them.  The volume of arrivals, combined with an unprepared administration, left thousands of children languishing in jail-like Border Patrol facilities, often for longer than the -hour limit set by federal law. The Biden administration is now scrambling to control the biggest surge in  years, with the nation on pace for as many as two million migrants at the southern border this year – the outcome the President said he wanted to avoid. The scale of the issue can be seen on the banks of the Rio Grande, where scattered for miles are the punctured dinghies and le jackets used by the human smugglers, known as coyotes. There are also thousands of colourful ripped-off wristbands issued by the drug cartels to identy migrants who have paid them for passage across the river. The dferent colours highlight how many times they have tried to cross and who is eligible to cross againthey have been sent back.  The wristbands we saw had dferent colours and words. Some read “entregadas”, meaning delivered. Others read “llegadas”, or arrivals. Those with red bands are first-time crossers, while yellow denotes those who have tried before and were sent back. As well as the physical peril of their journey, the migrants are in great danger once in the clutches of the highly organised cartels. As the gangs’ drug-smuggling ­operations were hindered by Covid they have turned Mr Biden’s softer border policy into a multi-million-dollar money-making scheme.

Sharon Rose has had eight Great Danes, including Barnaby.She and her husband have given homes to the giant breed since , and he was the biggest of all of their dogs - weighing in at a whopping kg, according to the Daily Star. Sadly, Barnaby had lost his fight with GDV - aka bloat - earlier last month. He was nearly four years old. Sharon said: “To say that I am devastated is an understatement. “My heart has been broken. I know it sounds dramatic, it doesn’t matter how many dogs you’ve had, it always is hard and it just gets harder.” Although only around for a few short years, Barnaby made quite the impact on Sharon. She described him as loud, friendly and a lover of people.Have you got a story for Team Dogs  Email webnews@mirrorDescribing their bond, Sharon said: “He idolised me.

In fact, throughout her time owning the giant breed, Sharon’s dogs have taken her to some fantastic places and allowed them to rub shoulders with a few celebrities.  She said: “Do you know anyone’s dog who goes to The Savoy Hotel  “Thataposs the sort of places our dogs take us to.

And wanting to do her bit for other animals, Sharon decided to donate Barnaby’s body to the Royal Veterinary College. This is not the first time the animal lover has donated her dogs’ bodies, she has previously done this with two of her dogs, although Barnaby is the first to go to the Royal Veterinary College. She said: “Everyone grieves for their animals in dferent ways. Some people may find it comforting that theyaposve got the dog buried in a garden, or theyaposve got the ashes, and they keep those. “That isn’t us.  “To me, a dogaposs body when they die, their spirit like ours goes, hopefully, to a better place and itaposs just the shell thataposs left. “So, Iaposve never had any ashes back after any of our animals have died.” On why donating Barnaby was important to her, Sharon said: “Because in their lives, they give so much to people. “If I say I don’t want the ashes back, they’re sort of thrown in the rubbish heap, their bodies are useless. “This way they might find something,it was bloat for example and they find something they didn’t know, it could save hundreds of dogs down the line, or thousands.

One junior doctor called it a slap in the face after the dficulties of the last year and having given up so much during the pandemic. Almost  anaesthetists are said to have been dropped from the NHS training scheme and cannot progress in their careers due to a lack of places. One junior doctor reportedly listed dozens of jobs across the country he would have considered moving to, but had been rejected for them all, despite ranking in the top third of candidates nationwide.  He told The Independent the news was a “slap in the face” after the past year and that he felt “let down” after giving so much during the pandemic. According to the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the most recent round of recruitment saw a record number of applicants. There were , at core trainee level and , doctors applying to continue training as anaesthetists following their initial years in the NHS. But there were only  posts available which left nearly  applicants unsuccessful. The College said: Due to the competition for each post, the College acknowledges that there will be a large number of applicants who will be disappointed by the news of not receiving an offer in this round. We also recognise the extremely dficult period that doctors in training have been going through since COVID- emerged, whilst being redeployed and continuing their training.And we should remember that doctors in training remain central to addressing not only the NHS’ response to the pandemic, but also to the ongoing recovery and clearance of the backlog. One of the doctors affected told The Independent the past year had been “immensely dficult, proper war zone stuff”, adding: “Months and months of training have been taken away from me. We had to do it, but also the NHS asked us to do it and now it’s like, ‘Thanks very much, you don’t get a job.’ It’s like a real slap in the face.” The doctor, who reportedly worked across several London hospitals during the crisis, added: “I remember going into work and having to make critical decisions on just one hour’s sleep.

How can I find some confidence  What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Coleen saysI’m online dating myself and I’m not even thinking that far ahead to the sex bit. Look, you’re not going to meet him once and jump into bed – you’ve probably never done that before, so why put pressure on yourself  You need to meet a few times and seethat chemistry is there. I think what your friends mean is that when you meet someone you really like, two or three dates down the line, you might have a great kiss and your mind and body will tell you when it’s right to take the next step into the bedroom. If you don’t feel ready, be honest with him. If he’s a nice guy, he’ll get it.

Prince Charles said he and his we were thinking of everyone celebrating, after what has been a challenging time, and reached out to Muslims not able to aposshare a hugapos on Eid. He spoke of loved ones lost and touched on his own grief after the death of his father, The Duke of Edinburgh, last month.  “The last year I know has been deeply challenging for us all, and I am only too aware of the impact of the pandemic on the Muslim community, he said. “This year so many families, like my own, will have an empty seat at their dinner table and friends are no longer be able to share the celebratory hug after Eid prayers. I can only say how deeply saddened I am by this tragic situation and how my heart goes out to all those who have lost their loved ones.”  The recorded message was delivered at a virtual tar, breaking of the fast, organised by the Naz Legacy Foundation. The foundation helps young people from minority communities and disadvantaged backgrounds by supporting their education whilst encouraging positive integration into British society.

The undercover investigation claimed the Queenaposs cousin was willing to use his royal status for personal profit, and to seek favours from Russian president Vladimir Putin. Prince Michael told undercover reporters posing as investors from South Korea in a virtual meeting that he could be hired for £, a day to make confidential representations to Mr Putinaposs regime. The revelation was made by Channel  Dispatches in collaboration with the Sunday Times, who set up a fake South Korean gold company called House of Haedong and approached five members of the royal family with an offer of a role. Prince Michael responded showing interest in working with the company, telling undercover reporters that he would give House of Haedong his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a ,fee and was happy to use his home in Kensington Palace as a backdrop.  Now, an insider has claimed that because Prince Michael was a regular guest at royal banquets - it gave him plenty of opportunity to try to make business contacts. The sting has reportedly prompted discussions at Buckingham Palace about invitations to banquets. The source told the Express: It gives him a perfect opportunity to make business contacts. Perhaps the Queen felt she would throw him some breadcrumbs that would allow him to keep the lestyle. The allegations against the Prince were laid out in Dispatches: Royals for Hire, which was broadcast on Monday evening on Channel . Prince Michael does not receive money from the civil list and earns a living acting as chairman of his own private company, which offers consultancy advice. He was also approached about a role helping the fictitious gold firm in Russia. The programme said his business partner Lord Simon Reading had used an event at Kensington Palace in , in which Prince Michael was a guest, to sell access to Mr Putin.  The event, to promote the Russian wrestling sport of Sambo, also offered opportunities to personally meet the Russian leader at a later date, Dispatches found. In a recorded meeting with the undercover reporters, Lord Reading said: If heis representing the House of Haedong, he could mention that to Putin and Putin would find the right person who is interested in South Korea or interested in gold. It just opens the door, you know, which is so helpful. He added: I think,I can say this, this is kind of slightly discreet, weaposre talking relatively discreetly here. Because we wouldnapost want the world to know that he is seeing Putin purely for business reasons,you follow me.  He went on to describe Prince Michael as Her Majestyaposs unofficial ambassador to Russia, and that tension between the UK and the Russian regime has not affected his relationship with Mr Putin. Responding to programme, Prince Michaelaposs office said: Prince Michael receives no public funding and earns his own living through a consultancy company that he has run for over  years. Prince Michael has no special relationship with President Putin. They last met in June  and Prince Michael has had no contact with him or his office since then.

The Prime Minister confirmed on Monday that a raft of lockdown restrictions will be lted from next week. Among the measures to be allowed once more are hugs with family and friends, as well as indoor socialising. It comes as part of the third step of the countryaposs exit strategy from lockdown, with pubs and restaurants to reopen for indoor drinking and dining. Family and friends will also be able to stay overnight at each otheraposs homes, paving the way for single people to have casual sex once more, while foreign travel can resume under the traffic light system.  Professor Cath Noakes, who is a SAGE member and mechanical engineer, warned people not to get carried away with hugging, saying it should be selective, short and avoid face-to-face contact. She told the BBC the risks of grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren are likely to be low in most cases.She said it would worry herwe were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again as it would perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus. She added: The reality is that when you hug someone you are very close to them and we know the virus is in peopleaposs breath and you are very close to that breath at that moment.  She advised thatpeople are going to hug others, it should be restricted to very small numbers of close family who perhaps you really value a hug from. I think donapost hug too frequently, keep it short, try and avoid being face to face, so perhaps turn your face away slightly, and even wearing a mask could help, she said. Prof Noakes warned that, even after vaccination, someone could get infected and transmit Covid to others. The latest stage of the roadmap out of lockdown will come into effect from May , which will see many restrictions imposed in January lted.

The governmentaposs advisors, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies [SAGE], said any resurgence of the virus wonapost be as bad as the waves that crippled the country last year. Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that the next step in the roadmap out of lockdown will be taken on May .People will be allowed to love hug ones again, go to pubs and restaurants indoors, stay in hotels and meet up in the rule of six inside. SPI-M, a sub-group of SAGE that contains disease modelling experts, said it is likely that Step  will lead to R greater than  in England.  This means the rate of the spread of infection will move into an increasing state, with those catching the disease infecting one or more people. The group added that due to widespread vaccination of people most likely to get severely ill or die any resurgence in hospital admissions and deaths following Step  of the Roadmap alone is highly unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. Estimates shown by the advisory body suggest that after May  and the later further unlocking in June there would be up to , hospital admission over the next year. There would also be a further , people to die from the virus by September . SPI-M said in its report, presented to SAGE last Wednesday: Modelling presented in these central scenarios is more optimistic than those in SPI-Maposs previous Roadmap modelling.  This is primarily due to recent evidence that vaccines signicantly reduce onwards transmission from people who have been vaccinated but nevertheless become infected then symptomatic. This suggests thatbaseline policies to reduce transmission are kept in place at the end of the Roadmap, behaviour does notto pre-pandemic levels, and vaccine roll out progresses, there is an opportunity to keep the next resurgence very small. Scientists also warned that a new iant could aposdouble or trebleapos the size of the next resurgence, and could be like an aposentirely new pandemicapos. The research was a summary of modelling done by teams at Warwick University, Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine.

In a post under the username @ movementonyourshoulder the mortied woman said: When the lady who cleans my house text me to let me know my six-year-old had started leaving her instructions.Mary can be seen rubbing her hand over her face, before the screen changes to show one of the notes.  In the picture, one of her daughteraposs dolls can be seen, alongside a piece of paper with the handwritten instruction: Put pants on my doll. Besides both of these are a small pair of underwear for the doll. The video was captioned: There are many more. Thanks a lot. Mary later claried that this incident occurred back in  and her daughter would never do anything like this now. She was six, we were mortied and discussed why this wasnapost okay, she added. She grew up respectful empathetic.

Each solar collector can save approximately kgs of carbon emissions per year.Now  have been shipped to Rwanda, with product trials set to begin next month, involving two hotels and seven households.Two local businesses have been enlisted to provide on-the-ground support, as well as to gather data from those involved in the trial.He set up the business in  after reading a journal paper about energy usage in Rwanda, where a large portion of household income is required to cover heating bills.Dr Ghani knew there was a solution to harness solar energy in an affordable way to heat water – inspiring the creation of the S flat-packable solar thermal collector.Despite Covid- impacting finances, things are continuing to pick up.#The pandemic has made it dficult for us to develop a lot of the relationships we need internationally,” he continued.#If you really want to enter the market you really need to know the right people and have the right partnerships # a lot of that is dependant on meeting the people face-to-face.#We haven#t been able to do any travelling during the pandemic so it#s really slowed things down for that market, which is why we#re looking at opportunities in the UK and Europe.The business experienced #huge supply chain issues# throughout the past  months, with cardboard orders taking months to arrive due to the high worldwide demand.He said: “Shipping has also been a bit of a nightmare, so getting materials was signicantly delayed, as well.”They were also required to raise funds # around £, in total # to ensure the business was not financially affected by the pandemic.#The pandemic also made it essential that we raised some cash from a iety of sources because of the delay in us entering the market,” he added.#We managed to avoid any kind of serious damage but it has made things challenging for us.#The news of the project in Rwanda getting under way comes following completion of the Royal Bank of Scotland Climate Entrepreneur Accelerator.The programme enabled Dr Ghani to establish a commercial plan and find investors to back the product.Royal Bank of Scotland also established a corporate partnership with SolarisKit becoming its first UK customer.He added: “As a new father, I became more aware of our need to tackle the climate emergency and felt I could do more as an entrepreneur than academic.#After realising that carbon emissions from the developing and emerging economies exceeded those produced by the industrialised nations, I was motivated to make a change.#“When you’re an entrepreneur, you feel siloed in your work, so support from the Royal Bank of Scotland has been great.#From becoming our first customer in the UK, to providing networking opportunities and group coaching sessions through the programme, the whole experience has been brilliant.”The SolarisKit team are also exploring the possibility of supporting rural communities in India.#We#re getting interest from Australia. There#s also been growing interest in the UK and Europe as well,” Dr Ghani said.#Where we see most of the impact is in Africa and other developing countries.#We#ve got one partner in India that has shown a lot of interest. We#re looking at developing a partnership with a large Indian company to enter that market.#He also hopes to grow the company, with a view to filling several new roles.Among the jobs will be an operations manager and a marketing manager to help increase capacity.Currently, they are able to produce , kits per year, with ambitions to reduce global carbon emissions by one billion kilograms in five years.Dr Ghani said: “We’re looking to recruit another five people within the next six months.“The operations manager and marketing manager jobs will be quite senior positions within the company.“We’re looking at expanding our production staff. At the Michelin site we can accommodate three full-time process workers.”Stuart Dearden, regional eco-system manager at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “It’s been remarkable to watch the growth of SolarisKit.#Dr Ghani’s drive and ambition is clear and we look forward to seeing the results of his trial in Rwanda.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-four-glasgow-teachers-conquered-mighty-whirlpool-scottish-first","story":"WHEN keen kayakers Jim, Angus, Bill and Peter found themselves storm-bound on an island off the west coast in , they dreamt up a history-making plan."},{"url":null,"title":"catch-fish-chips-review-rating-glasgows-chippies","story":"ldquoIrsquove only got myself to blame ndash I love a sneaky chippy. wrote my colleague Jack Aitchison in a previous takeaway review for the Glasgow Times."},{"url":null,"title":"council-open-public-survey-pollok-bike-lanes","story":"GLASGOW City Council is set to open consultation on controversial bike lanes which have been installed in Pollok."},{"url":null,"title":"ask-janice-get-mum-drop-talk-grandkids","story":"Dear Janice, I am only  but my mum is constantly putting me under so much pressure to start a family that I am now avoiding her calls.

councillors will be “one of the most important” in years – with the future of the city centre to be decided.The city growth and resources session will be the last convened by outgoing co-leader Douglas Lumsden, who was elected to Holyrood last week.This morning it was revealed Ryan Houghton will take over leadership of the local authority’s Scottish Conservative group.Members will be asked later this week to vote on him becoming new council co-leader alongside Aberdeen Labour’s Jenny Laing.Speaking ahead of his final meeting at the helm, Mr Lumsden outlined the signicance of the talks.He said: “It’s a really important time where he’s taking over, in terms of what we’ve seen in the city centre due to Covid.“It’s taken a real battering and there needs to be a response.“The committee this week, I think, is one of the most important committees we’ve had in terms of this administration.”There are a total of  items on the agenda for tomorrow’s meeting, including a look at the revised city centre masterplan.Earlier this year members agreed to spend £ million for a review of the scheme, designed to aid Aberdeen’s recovery from the pandemic.Tomorrow they will be asked to push ahead with the project, which will now involve the development of a plan focusing on the beach, and the addition of new electric vehicle infrastructure.Key city centre locations such as the Bon Accord Centre and Norco House – the base for John Lewis – also feature, as will the former BHS store and indoor market.Last week we revealed Town House chiefs are considering a surprise bid for the site, with a view to transforming it into a “destination venue” with permanent and pop-up space for local traders.Developer Patrizia currently has planning permission to redevelop both spaces into offices, flats and retail.Mr Lumsden added: “There’s a lot of work ahead of us, and some quite exciting projects coming up – thinking about the BHS building on Union Street, and the city centre masterplan.“There’s real exciting things coming up on the agenda – things we need to be doing to move the city forward.”Members at tomorrow’s meeting will be asked to back a potential bid for a Freeport in Aberdeen, which Mr Lumsden says could prove a major employer.He said: “If you look at where we are now with the decline in oil and gas, and the decline in retail,there’s a chance of something that will bring thousands of jobs then we should grab it with both hands.”Councillors at the meeting will also be asked to approve business trips to the likes of Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea, and receive an update on plans for a bronze Denis Law statue near Provost Skene’s House.At the weekend Mr Lumsden was voted into Holyrood as one of four Scottish Conservative MSPs on the North East regional list.While he is stepping down as co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, he will continue as a councillor until next year’s local elections.He said: “It’s a shame I won’t be staying around in the co-leader role to see these projects through, but I’ll still be keeping an eye on things.“I’ve gained a lot of experience from the council role and I’ll be fighting Aberdeen’s corner down in Holyrood.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

women.The study also found that % of women attempted at least one DIY haircut during the two lockdowns, compared to % of men.The poll was commissioned by Sovereign Grooming, which has major city centre salons at New Waverley in Edinburgh and Union Street in Aberdeen.It has been released on the day First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is poised to confirm a further easing of lockdown restrictions.Kyle Ross, managing director of Sovereign Grooming and two-time Scottish Barber of the Year, said: “Like most, we’ve been overwhelmed by the client response to us re-opening after lockdown and our diaries have been packed for six weeks.“Therefore, I’m not surprised to see such a large proportion of men, in particular, keen to see salons remain open. They play a big role in male mental wellbeing.“The Scottish Government’s approach to salons changed quite dramatically between the first and second lockdown.“After the first, salons were among the last businesses to re-open. However, this time around the government had us in the first wave to open.“The reality is that salons are very well controlled and sterile environments which can be operated safely with social distancing in place.”I’m not surprised to see such a large proportion of men, in particular, keen to see salons remain open. They play a big role in male mental wellbeing.#The survey also found that % of women said they found their partner more attractive after a haircut, while % of men said the same.Mr Ross said one major change since the last lockdown had been the surging popularity of longer, mainly retro, hairstyles.“A lot of people have been coming in looking for iations of the mullet and it is definitely a developing trend, particularly in Scottish cities,” he said.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/demographics-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Itrsquos named after Saint Fillan and the healing pool associated with him was their next destination. Izzy pulled Bess into a minor road and found a parking place.ldquoItrsquos not far, she said, pointing to a sign that said Holy Pool.Finn raised his eyebrows, giving her a sceptical look her concept of not far was dferent to his!ldquoNo, really, this time it isnrsquot, she assured him. ldquoThe pool is just over there, a very short walk through the trees.The morning was lting and Izzy wandered to a nearby small hillock to take in the view. The mountain tops were still mostly hidden under blankets of mist, but small breaks in the cloud were giving tantalising glimpses of Ben More and Ben Lui.Finn joined his aunt.She spoke to her nephew while looking out to the landscape: ldquoA strath is a river valley, Finn, and the river here flows to Loch Dochart. This is Strathfillan, itrsquos named after the saint of that name who came and settled here to preach his religion, before Scotland even existed.ldquoYou mean the saint whose magic healing stones we saw at the mill in Killin Izzy nodded with a very pleased smile, happy hersquod remembered.ldquoYes, thatrsquos him. This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

If there is an opinion that this is a good idea then it could be brought forward at a better time.Musselburgh councillor Stuart Currie agreed there would be other ideas worth considering.He said: ldquoThere are always lots of ideas that come from the House of Commons some make sense and some donrsquot.ldquoYou have to be careful of the costs of having to rename a trunk road going through Scotland to England it would be hugely costly.ldquoObviously, in terms of the trunk road network, as soon as you cross the Border it changes responsibility.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-scrap-popular-items-menu-make-way-5-new-offerings","story":"Fast food lovers will know, the UKrsquos most popular burger chain regularly updates its menu throughout the year with promotions to keep their offerings fresh.From this week, McDonaldrsquos has unveiled five new items that will be available to customers until mid-June.The new products will be part of the chains menu from May  to June  meaning you will only have a short time to sample their new offerings.One of the items making ais a firm favourite among McDonaldrsquos lovers, the Bacon Clubhouse Double.The burger consists of two % beef patties, two rashers of Beechwood smoked bacon, a slice of cheddar cheese, onions, tomato, lettuce, and sauce.Another item being added to the menu is the Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.A chicken option consisting of two crunchy Chicken Selects, Emmental cheese, lettuce, red onions, tomato relish, and mayonnaise.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"nancy-drew-frankensteins-monster-author-monique-roffey-discusses-books-shaped-life-work","story":"Favourite book you read as child All the Nancy Drew mysteries excited meand then all my brothersrsquo Willard Price books enraptured me .What was the first book to make an impact on you Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.

Thats my type of character.Whatrsquos your least favourite literary genre Literary fiction isnrsquot a genre, its a whole dferent type of book and we often see ious types of genre mixed in.

It mirrors the health of our economy, as cranes in the sky and diggers in the ground are indicators of buoyant times. However, despite its importance, our talent pool is dwindling. This is concerning, given the Scottish construction industry would have to increase current recruitment by over , new workers each year to deliver against current project pipelines.The reasons behind the skills gap are complex. The construction industry has suffered from outdated misconceptions and is often assumed to be male-dominated, manual, dirty work. When projects do not go to plan, contractors are often blamed, regardless of the context which negatively impacts the industry.Macro-issues also have a role to play in the erosion of talent. The  financial crash resulted in the industry losing a generation of workers, graduates and apprentices who were forced to look at other sectors. Fortunately, the Covid crisis has not had the same devastating impact a recent report from Addleshaw Goddard found that  per cent of businesses in the sector reported their cashflow positions were secure or very secure, indicating optimism.There are several ways we can rewrite the narrative about this fast-paced, vibrant industry and attract more people to it. The first is education. Here at GRAHAM we support schools, colleges, universities, and employability organisations to raise awareness about the roles within our industry. The range of opportunities is vast, from traditional trade work to opportunities in design, planning and commercial management to graphic design and HR.At site level, we must educate and continuously train as the industry is evolving quickly. Construction can be intensive, however off-site fabrication, technology advancement and better working conditions, coupled with well-structured technical apprenticeships and targeted vocational qualications offer the potential for a fulfilling career.We must then look to retain our people and hone their skills via continuous improvement. Our employee development programme provides a framework for us to invest through mentoring and tailored in-house training, allowing people to draw from the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience within our business.We know that strong female representation creates a more erse, sharper workforce, so attracting and keeping women in construction is key to sustained success and growth. Girls outperform boys on maths and science-based subjects until they reach secondary school ndash the question is why this changes later. We continue to break down gender stereotypes by encouraging girls to look more closely at Stem subjects when we visit schools and by supporting initiatives such as Ayrshire College Girls into Construction.Finally, we need more construction champions. Funding for apprenticeships and training is crucial however endorsement from people in positions of influence and power is invaluable. A campaign of positive messages about construction as the leblood of the Scottish economy will reinforce it as an industry that benefits us all and will help us to promote it as a positive career destination.Craig Bridges is Strategic Director for GRAHAM"},{"url":null,"title":"food-writer-rukmini-iyer-revolutionise-summer-barbecue","story":"Food writer Rukmini Iyer on how to revolutionise your summer barbecueRukmini IyerldquoMy mum doesnrsquot really hold back on constructive criticism, the food writer and cook admits. ldquoI think her words are, lsquoIf I donrsquot tell you, then who will rsquoBut that honesty came in useful, with Iyer saying it was ldquoreally helpful to get her feedback ndash particularly as she used the time to write her latest cookbook dedicated to veggie and vegan barbecue recipes.Both Iyerrsquos parents are GPs ndash her mother is now retired, but her father was still working. ldquoSo dad was at the surgery, but he likes to pop back for lunch because itrsquos not too far ndash so I tried to have things rolling off the barbecue in time for him to have a quick lunch before he went back to the surgery, she says.ldquoIt was very nice because as an adult, you donrsquot spend that much time with your parents.

I was taking a chopping board, all my veg, a couple of little bowls, doing all the prep outside and sitting and waiting for the barbecue to light. It was maximising being in open space.She also found it a ldquomore mindful way to cook, while still sharing sharing some similarities with her smash hit Roasting Tin series of books which all focus on easy, one pan meals you bung in the oven. ldquoWith this one, itrsquos similar in you just have to chop some things, put them on the barbecue, take them off and put a nice dressing on, she says.ldquoBut yoursquove got that added element I think is interesting, where you have to be quite watchful. You learn to understand how your barbecue is working. You think about when itrsquos hot, when itrsquos not. Yoursquore standing in front of it and itrsquos a visual and very tactile way to cook ndash I like that added element that yoursquore very close to the cooking process.There was another added benefit to decamping to her parentsrsquo house: space. ldquoHaving an outdoor space ndash I live in London in a flat, so usually Irsquom not really able to, Iyer says. ldquoBut even though I was doing all the barbecuing in my parentsrsquo garden, I was very much thinking, lsquoWhatrsquos portable  What can I do on a small barbecue rsquoldquoYou canrsquot assume everyonersquos got a massive Weber range ndash you might just be using a small one you got from TK Maxx.

But there is another element.The bigger Scottish story  Theof the incumbent Scottish Government, together with what that could mean for the future governance of the wider UK. When a lot is at stake, a lot of people turn out.Results still to come, of course. But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet. One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence. On taking back control,you like. Rather than fleeing from a perceived threat.That is why SNP Ministers have been so keen to govern moderately and sensibly, within existing devolved powers, while simultaneously promoting independence.Read more from Brian Taylor: Why Nicola Sturgeon offers her supporters Paradise DeferredBrexit, in particular, may create the conditions for revisiting the independence prospect, not least because Scotland was told that staying in the UK was the only way to retain EU membership.However, add Brexit to the virus and economic worries. That does not equate to a confident public. Quite the contrary. Voters might feel inclined to keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse. They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-respect-positive-role-scotlands-languages-dialects-play-lives","story":"Unfortunately we have a history going back centuries which has suppressed languages in Scotland. From the  Treaty of Iona when Highland chiefs had to agree to send their heirs to English Protestant schools, through to ious education Acts which discriminated against the use of the Gaelic language, speakers have been punished and disrespected with predictable results. The same dismissive approach has generally been taken towards the ious Scots dialects.We are so fortunate that Scots Gaelic has not disappeared completely. Its daily use may sadly be hugely diminished, but the culture of the Gaeltachd through music, poetry and dance ndash not to mention language courses through the Gaelic College, UHI and the excellent Radio nan Gaidheal and BBC Albandash has been really encouraging, strengthening our Celtic links with other Celtic nations.We should treasure it and, where possible, bring it back into daily le. Im not a Gael but, for example, why should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names  Whether in school, broadcasting or in Parliament, it would be a small but signicant step to use peoples Gaelic names. People would soon get used to them rather than view them as something to be avoided, just as they are becoming used to the names of \"newer\" generations of Scots originally from dferent cultures.The good work done to give Gaelic names on street signs, town signs and public vehicles are not, as some people would have it, confusing, but of real interest to all Scots as well as our tourists. The everyday usage of peoples Gaelic names would add to this. Likewise, many Scottish dialects are also threatened through \"homogenising\" our language. As a consequence, we lose so many words that provided colour and local identity. Some local authority schools may be more accepting of language ersity, but private schools perhaps not.Those who do not take an interest in Scotlands cultural history and the preservation of it, should broaden their minds and start to have a bit more respect for the positive role that the languages and dialects have, rather than head towards a \"monoculture\".Andrew Turnbull, Perth.TIME TO LISTEN TO RURAL SCOTSWHILST your Letters Pages are full of concerns from those living in the Central Belt, why is it that the vast array of wind turbines and HV pylons that desecrate rural Scotland receive no attention  The First Minister may well criticise Boris Johnson, but at least Westminster has extended democratic rights over wind farm applications to rural England. Why then do Central Belt politicians refuse to grant the same rights to those in rural Scotland A good move by Holyrood in listening to rural Scots would be a decision to run the HV cables in the GlenKens of Galloway underground, closely followed by a decision to set up two National Parks in southern Scotland to balance those north of the M.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.GREEN CLAIMS DONT STAND UPGREEN electricity should be electricity that is generated  per cent from renewable sources, not fossil fuels. Several major companies claim to supply \" per cent green electricity\". This is impossible since fossil fuels generate a large percentage of the electricity sent to the grid.A report by consultancy firm Baringa in partnership with ScottishPower and Good Energy shows that as little as three per cent of the power supplied by green providers is \"genuinely green\" they have asked the Advertising Standards Authority to investigate. Could the claim of \" per cent green electricity\" be termed \"greenwashing\" which is similar to \"whitewashing\", but used exclusively by the green brigade Clark Cross, Linlithgow.* JOHN Flemingclaims that I am unaware that wind power can be used to electrolyse hydrogen. He is obviously unaware of the sheer cost and unviability of this idea in the context of trying to power a huge industrial economy like the UK.Other people in his shoes claim that batteries are the answer. But the worlds biggest batterywould only provide the UK with energy for a theoretical maximum of . seconds. I cant find the cost of Gateway but its undoubtedly at least  million. I dont have data for hydrogen from electrolysis but its surely in the same ball park.Geoff Moore, Alness.* JOHN Fleming should note that any process connected with renewable energy, and now with that latest fad ndash the storage of electricity ndash is always presented as being feasible and just needing a bit of money to perfect.

The people of Scotland.But who are the people of Scotland and what did they say exactly  In her speech, Ms Sturgeon said the SNPrsquos re-election for a fourth term was extraordinary and she was right. All the precedents tell us that, after  years or so, people get fed up with the party in power and give the other guys a try, and yet the SNP, after  years, and a persistently poor record in office, has attracted nearly half the vote. Itrsquos not supposed to happen this way, and yet it has.However, in acknowledging the SNPrsquos achievement, we should also look a little closer at what the First Minister said in the speech because thatrsquos how we can compare it to what actually happened in the election. The dferences between the two ndash what Ms Sturgeon said, and what happened ndash reveal some of the linguistic techniques the First Minister and the SNP use. But they also reveal what needs to changewersquore ever going to break the current deadlock.First, the ldquopeople of Scotland stuff. Irsquom assuming Ms Sturgeon bases her right to speak for the people on the pro-independence majority at Holyrood. As the First Minister pointed out, the SNP won a record number of the constituency seatsand, even after the adjustment for the list votes, the SNP and the Greens have  of the parliamentrsquos  seats, or % ndash a majority.However, the SNP and the Greens have a majority of the seats based on a minority of the votes. The SNP won .% of the constituency vote and the Greens took .% ndash or % combined. The Tories, the Lib Dems, and Labour, on the other hand, took .%. You might see this as just nit-picking over a clear win for the nationalists ndash and they did clearly win under the current system ndash but the result means two things. First, when Nicola Sturgeon claims to speak for the people of Scotland, shersquos really only speaking for .% of them at most. And second, we need a better system, based on how people actually vote.The need for a better system, I hope, would be obvious to any fair-minded voter. For a start ndash although it ultimately failed ndash at one point Alba looked like it might be able to do a bit of jiggery-pokery with the list vote to articially boost pro-independence representation. But the other lesson of the election is that many pro-UK voters felt they had to vote tactically, and many did so with positive results. Some unionists see that as good news, but unionists shouldnrsquot have to vote tactically to get fair representation. It is another argument for a better, more proportional system, ideally single transferable vote.Similar problems apply to Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks about another referendum. A referendum, she said, was the will of the people and anyone who tried to stop it would be standing in direct opposition to the people . But the assertion is based on the same logical flaw that .% represents a settled will . You might also assume the .% that voted Tory, Labour or Lib Dem do not want a referendum. In any case, the idea that another vote on independence is the will of the people is a distinctly dodgy claim.Perhaps the change thatrsquos needed here ndash on top of a better system ndash is a referendum that ensures the result does actually reflect a settled will rather than the SNPrsquos version of it. The SNP is demanding a referendum on .% and would claim a victory in the referendum on .%, but both, to some extent, are a distortion of whatrsquos going on. One way to stop it would be to require two-thirds for a referendum win ndash at least, that way it would ensure talk of ldquowill of the people had a better basis in reality.But even thatrsquos not the end of the changes we need because Ms Sturgeon also talked a lot about the Tories . Scotland, she said, was facing many more years of right-wing Tory governments and could choose a more progressive alternative. These are familiar comments and part of an attempt to portray the border with England as an unbridgeable gulf. The Scots, she says, are utterly dferent from the rest of the UK, therefore the SNP, therefore referendum, therefore independence.But the SNPrsquos argument runs into the same old ldquopeople of Scotland problem. Ms Sturgeon speaks about anti-Tory Scotland in the same way she speaks about the will of the people, asScotland were one entity that speaks with one voice. But Scotland is Liberal Caithness where my mother grew up and Tory Aberdeenshire where I grew up and itrsquos old-school Labour Ayrshire where I live now. Yes, the SNP dominates, but perhaps Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech could have acknowledged that Scotland is not one thing and that half of the country didnrsquot vote for her. Such an approach would have shown more subtlety, reality, and ndash dare I say it ndash humility.But what did we get instead  A speech based on a logical flaw and fuelled by anger, arrogance, and, I suspect, a bit of disappointment that she didnrsquot get an outright majority. But then maybe thatrsquos the last thing that needs to change: Nicola Sturgeon herself. The talk before the election was of building momentum and an SNP majority that Boris Johnson couldnrsquot say no to, and the SNP certainly needs such momentum before it can achieve another referendum and win it. A stand-still election like the one wersquove just had will not do.But to achieve such momentum, Nicola Sturgeon will need to convince voters who didnrsquot back her ndash the .% ndash and they are unlikely to be chuffed by talk of the ldquowill of the people. They might be impressed, though, by something more realistic and honest. There is no ldquowill of the people, there is only a people ided, andNicola Sturgeon acknowledged that, and started talking about it, maybe she would have a better chance of changing it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She says that the last  years have seen numbers fall, with the most rapid declines being recorded in the last decade.ldquoNot everyone is aware of how badly populations have been affected, she says.ldquoIn some areas it still looks asthere are thousands of birds, while in other places they have all but disappeared.The first step to tackling the issue is raising awareness of the problem amongst those who can help to fix it and that means working with rural communities to change the timings of, amongst other things, grass cutting regimes.ldquoWithout the sort of cover that they get from long grass the birds are much more at risk from predators, says Jessica.Other steps include not rolling fields in spring, so that nests are not destroyed.Changing practices is not always straightforward but Jessica says she has been delighted by levels of engagement amongst farmers, including making lsquoscrapesrsquo ndash shallow ponds that are dug out by a digger and remain damp all year round, allowing insects to breed and offering feed for waders.Being able to offer small grants to help with this kind of work has proved to be very useful and other habitat management work includes cutting rushes and carrying out pest control.The public too, says Jessica, have a part to play by keeping dogs under control and Working for Waders is reinforcing the Access Code through promoting local signage that explains the breeding season of the birds and what dog owners can do to protect nests and chicks.ldquoOystercatchers, like all waders, nest on the ground which is why keeping dogs away from them during nesting time is so important.Some waders, including GoldenPlovers, make the journey to Scotland every summer, heading for moorlands to breed before flying back again before winter sets in.Redshanks, meanwhile, can be found around remote streams and wetlands, although these are getting harder to spot with their numbers declining % in  years.NatureScot, Scotlandrsquos Rural College, the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology, the James Hutton Institute, the Game and Wildle Conservation Trust and others have all joined forces in Working for Waders to put in place additional measures that they hope will help to improve the chances of the birds.This way of working follows the recently adopted Shared Approach to Wildle Management a collaborative model which brings all sorts of people together to develop action.Working for Waders is also open to ordinary members of the public to share their knowledge and enthusiasm to help tackle the decline of wading birds across Scotland. And the project, which was launched in , is continuing to capture the imagination of increasing numbers of people who have a shared interest in ensuring that the distinctive cry of the lapwing and the lonely call of the curlew donrsquot disappear from these shores.Just recently Working For Waders received a generous donation that allowed it to buy  trail cameras that are helping its members to understand the successes and failures of the waders across Scotland.These cameras have been distributed to farms across the country including the Isle of Skye, Speyside, Galloway and the Borders ndash all of them once home to large populations of waders.These cameras will be used to monitor what will hopefully be successful breeding seasons and help to inform watchers about the problems faced by these birds as part of a citizen science project that could make a positive impact on the future of some of Scotlandrsquos most important bird species.For more information visit: www.workingforwadersThis article is brought to you in association with NatureScot."},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove-refuses-rule-legal-action-indyref2","story":"The Cabinet Office minister, who is in Scotland this week, twice refused to give a straight answer on the point in a briefing with journalists.On Sunday, Mr Gove gave a series of ambiguous answers to the question on TV shows, saying he didnrsquot want to discuss the possibility of a Supreme Court challenge.Asked point blank todayhe was ruling out a challenge, he dismissed the issue as ldquotheorising and ldquoabstract debate and tried to change the subject, but did not deny it was a possibility.After the SNP won a landslide fourth term in last weekrsquos Holyrood election, Nicola Sturgeon said she would press ahead with Indyref when the Covid pandemic allowed.The First Minister has said she wants the vote by , thenindependence in .In a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday, she told the Prime Minister another referendum was now ldquoa matter of when not , despite his previous refusal to allow it.Asked about the FMs remark, Mr Gove said: ldquoOur focus is purely and principally on recovery at the moment.

We know that. Look at tax ndash reform of which is perennially the priority of both Leftand Right . After a couple of centuries of this, the UK has a tax code eight times longer than Agrave la recherche du temps perdu ndash  million words of it, none of which apply to the likes of Amazons Jeff Bezos.You may take that as an illustration that improving mattersis hard, because of unintended consequences, bureaucracy, the crooked timber of humanity, or some other excuse.You may, in fact, take the unsatisfactory nature of reality and general cussedness of things as a further indication that Something Must Be Done. If so, yoursquore probably just temperamentally political something ndash paradoxically ndash about which nothing can be done.:Andrew McKie: Is the conversion of political class to green issues all it seems But your average professional politician takes this a step further, with the kind of futile insistence on action that I mean. When it is crystal clear that not much can be done about a situation, they insist on doing something, anything, simply so that they can be seen to be taking action ndash asthat were, in itself, some sort of intrinsic good.Which brings me to Sir Keir Starmerrsquos exciting reshuffle of his shadow cabinet. Personally, I doubt that the message being sent by the people of Hartlepool was that they wouldnrsquot vote Labour until Nick Brown and Valerie Vaz had been sacked and Angela Rayner either demoted or promoted or both, depending on who you speak to.But evenSir Keirrsquos rejigging of his senior team had been better handled, more ambitious or extensive, or done something genuinely useful, such as expelling every member of Momentum, it would still have been a largely pointless course of action. Because the conclusion which anyone would draw from the English election results ndash and which, since he is not an idiot, I suspect Sir Keir himself has reached ndash is that there are no circumstances in which Labour can win an election in the foreseeable future.This doesnrsquot make all action a waste of time, but it makes it pretty well pointless for Sir Keir himself. He is in the unhappy position, similar to that of William Hague during Tony Blairrsquos first term in office, of being the leader of a party that stands no chance of ing to power until several things happen.William HagueThe first is that the party changes profoundly, the second is that the public forgets what it has been like recently, the third is that voters get fed up with the Conservatives ndash currently, whatever the view looks like in Scotland, in the happy position of being both popular and lucky ndash and the fourth is that the demographics of the entire country sht.The corresponding problems are that Labour currently has no idea how it ought to change: worse, large chunks of its membership remain unaware that it needs to and ndash again, rather like the Tories in the late s ndash think that they ought to be offering more of what has just been comprehensively rejected.That, of course, is an impediment to the public forgetting the electoral catastrophe that was Jeremy Corbynrsquos period as leader, especially when he was on the radio yesterday bizarrely claiming that Labourrsquos principal problem was Peter Mandelson. The third problem will, as with all governments, eventually solve itself, though as the examples of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair show, it can take a very long time and isnrsquot in any case something within Labourrsquos control. And the same is true, with knobs on, for the last point.The realignment of English voting, with the Tories picking up seats in the North and Labourrsquos gains coming exclusively in liberal, metropolitan seats, especially in London, has led some to speculate that there could simply be, over the next few years, a kind of reversal. The ldquoRed Wall of the North can be compensated for by Labour making inroads in a southern ldquoBlue Wall, according to these optimists, who have seized on the party gaining a few council seats in places like Worthing and Tunbridge Wells.The trouble is that the arithmetic doesnrsquot work. You canrsquot win an English election on metropolitan votes alone, partly because they are geographically concentrated. In fact, almost by definition, any vote heavily reliant on the young, graduates and cosmopolitan liberals is going to be concentrated.:What does Scottish Labours Anas Sarwar do next This is a psychological problem for Labour, too. Its most ardent supporters donrsquot know anyone like them, or who lives near them, who would dream of voting Tory, so they canrsquot imagine why anyone would. This makes it easy for them to conclude that they are morally superior, and that their opponents are wicked, selfish, racist or thick probably all of them.This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs because, even for those who donrsquot reflexively think the current Westminster government is doing badly or is ill-intended, it should be challenged robustly. This is true of all governments, of course, but Boris Johnsonrsquos freewheeling style makes it particularly necessary. But his is also a free-spending government, so Labourrsquos usual approach ndash spending more on public services ndash isnrsquot really an option.Though there is, as yet, little sign of Labour recovering here, the Scottish party may be in a better ndash or slightly less terrible ndash position than its counterpart south of the border. Anas Sarwar, just in the job, looks as though he could provide a personable and credible opposition, given a fair wind. Whether he does may matter to Labour at Westminster, because there is one caveat to my opinion about the arithmetic of English realignment, and itrsquos this: it doesnrsquot add up, unless you also have an awful lot of Scottish Labour MPs.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

His paintings can now be found in museums and collections worldwide.He continued working in London and Scotland until his death in  when, after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, he took his own le.On his paintings, he said: ldquoI paint flowers as a way of getting as close as possible to what I perceive as the truth, my truth of the time in which I live.Hugo Burge, director of Marchmont, said he hoped Mr McEwens cottage would prove to be a place of continued inspiration.He said: ldquoWersquore delighted to be able to honour the memory and achievements of someone who was not just a man of towering talent but who was so well-liked and had such generosity of spirit.ldquoI very much hope that Fogo will be an inspirational place for many more generations of artists."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12592214.jpg?type=article-full","title":"european-countries-40-children-overweight","story":"The World Health Organisationwarned that Covid- could potentially amply ldquoone of the most worrying trends in Europe.School closures and reduced access to meals and physical activity for children is likely to have widened inequalities, it said.Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said anecdotal evidence from clinics ldquoconfirmed European fears.: Scrap BMI, calorie labels and doctored adverts, MPs urgeA major report by the WHO looking at rates of childhood obesity in Europe found that Mediterranean countries had the highest rates.Data collected from , children aged six to nine in  countries found that % were overweight in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain.

However, the reaction from across the Irish Sea at having only eight players make the cut ndash with Johnny Sexton, James Ryan and Garry Ringrose amongst the omitted ndash was startlingly fierce.The fact that Scotland also have eight players on the trip was a particular source of angst, with former Irish forward turned outspoken pundit Neil Francis amusingly unhinged in his outrage.He claimed that he had detected a lsquosheepishnessrsquo about Gregor Townsend during an interview ahead of the grand reveal and asserted that this was clearly because the Scotsman had managed to bully or manipulate Lions head coach Warren Gatland into picking an unjustiable number of his countryman for the trip.Poor Warren! Who knew he was so malleable! ldquoNone of the Scottish players who have been included are starting Test standard, asserted Francis.ldquoGatland will not risk the whole Test series on the vagaries of some lunar alignment in Finn Russellrsquos head or how he feels when he gets out of bed on the day of the Test match, he snorted.ldquoBringing Duhan van der Merwe makes me sick to my stomach, he gasped.ldquoAli Price is the worst original selection pick at scrum-half for decades, he howled.Those are just the most colourful highlights. Stuart Hogg, Chris Harris, Rory Sutherland and Zander Fagerson were also targeted in an astonishing tirade. There wasnrsquot much in the way of analysis, but you canrsquot doubt the manrsquos passion!Former Ireland and Lions captain Brian OrsquoDriscoll was slightly more circumspect but his snfy take on Russell being selected ahead of Sexton was even more disappointing because it came from someone who we expect a bit more self-awareness and even-handedness from.ldquoWhen yoursquove got the Scottish head coach in Gregor Townsend in one corner, when yoursquore talking - decisions, of course hersquos going to be arguing for all of Finn Russellrsquos positive attributes, he said. ldquoThen you wait and look across and no-one is saying that about Johnny Sexton.This conveniently overlooks the fact that Gatland knows all about Sextonrsquos attributes, having started him at No. in five out of the last six Lions Tests over two tours, and naming him on the bench in the other. It also ignores the fact that Russell and Townsend have a chequered history, and while their relationship has been resurrected following that spectacular spat during the  Six Nations, the idea of the coach being tunnel visioned by the playerrsquos positive attributes to the exclusion of all  is patently ludicrous.In fairness, not all the wrath has been directed towards Scotland for having the temerity to match Irelandrsquos representation. Englandrsquos haul of  players, despite losing to all three of the other contributing countries during the recent Six Nations, has also gone down badly.While this disproportionate reaction from our Celtic cousins is a big relief because it proves that Scottish rugby does not have a monopoly on unjustied indignation, it does also highlight how important having a healthy representation on a Lions tour can be for a country, and wersquore not just talking about bragging rights here.The omission of players like -year-old Ryan and -year-old Ringrose is raw in Ireland because they know from previous experience that a tour such as this offers benefit which reaches beyond the inidual players involved.The self-belief, toughness and basic understanding of what is required to operate at the very highest level rubs off and it becomes a virtuous circle. In reality, eight players on the tour is not a disaster for Ireland, but they would much rather have  or  because the more players they have who have lived through the experience the wider the benefit reaches, and they would much rather their opponents didnrsquot have the same number getting that exposure.Over five successive tours during the last  years, Scotland have not had more than three players in an initial squad, which has undoubtedly left the national team and the two pro sides at a critical disadvantage when competing in high-class, big-pressure matches.Now, having eight players ndash plus two coaches ndash coming out of an environment where they have spent two months living, training, playing and hopefully winning alongside the best that Britain and Ireland have to offer, whilst taking on arguably the sportrsquos ultimate challenge, can have huge legacy benefits to the pro game in this country.Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Chris Harris, Duhan van der Merwe, Ali Price, Zander Fagerson, Rory Sutherland and Hamish Watson owe it to themselves ndash and they owe it to Scotland ndash to make the absolute most of this opportunity.Scotlandrsquos biggest ever Lionsrsquo representation was nine, when Finlay Calder led the touring side to a - series victory over Australia, and they won the Grand Slam the following year. The only previous time Scotland got eight onto a tour was in , just before the  Grand Slam success.

social media communication, including but not limited to advertising, was ndash besides televised debates ndash the most important tool for political parties to get their messages across and persuade the electorate to vote for them.Social media advertising represents an important add-on in a wider context of persuasive communication during political campaigning, but it is unlikely to be decisive.We, therefore, have to be careful when interpreting social media advertising spending in relation to the electoral success.However, data on how much political parties in Scotland spent on Facebook ads reveals some interesting insights.It confirms that the partiesrsquo stance on the constitutional question in relation to the Scottish independence , political performance and track record rather than social media budget played a decisive role when people were casting their ballots.:Labour spent pound, on election adverts, three times SNP spendingOut of the three largest parties in the ScottishParliament, the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon spent the least on Facebook adswith the Scottish Labour being a record spender , followed by the Scottish Conservatives . Yet the SNP had the highest efficiency per seat won.They had a very strong start at the beginning of the election campaign and additionally capitalised on excellent leadership and communication of the First Minister during the pandemic.Their messages emphasising competent leadership of Nicola Sturgeon and democratic argument for the second independence referendum after the COVID- recovery were cleverly chosen and boded well with the Scottish electorate.The fact that the Scottish Labour and Anas Sarwar were the highest spenders indicates their ambition to become the biggest opposition party. Anas Sarwar is considered as one of the most talented leaders in the Labour Party, not just in Scotland, but UK-wide, yet his persistent distancing from the constitutional debate did not seem to convince the voters.The Labour focused on COVID recovery instead, but orcing the recovery from the constitutional question is like discussing the issue without a backdrop. The constitutional question matters to people of Scotland on both sides of the debate, so it is unsurprising that their advertising spending did not translate into an electoral success.The Scottish Conservatives were campaigning on a single issue ndash opposing the second referendum ndash and came across as the most convincing amongst the pro-union parties. Their relatively high spending figure indicates how important this election was for the future of the United Kingdom and their investment was the second most efficient after the SNP.The Liberal Democrats found themselves in a conundrum. They pose as a pro-EU party, even though Willie Rennie during televised debates showed an astonishing lack of knowledge and understanding of the EU, evident in incorrect statements on how old the EU is and misguided comparisons between the EU and the UK. Lib Dems also lack clear policies on what this pro-European stance means, while reducing the constitutional argument to a simple ldquowe do not need another isive referendum. It is unsurprising that their spending of pound, was the least efficient per seat won .:Alba Party spent pound, down Mark Zuckerbergs toilet as election ad spend revealedFollowing the Liberal Democrats were the Scottish Greens with pound, spent on Facebook ads, indicating their hopes to increase the representation in the Scottish Parliament, which they did with a reasonable efficiency. They came across as a very consistent and competent party in this election and their pro-independence arguments were at times more eloquent and convincing than the SNPrsquos.The increasing societal concern about climate emergency, particularly in the light of post-COVID recovery, also played in their favour.Albarsquos spending was the lowest and the most fruitless. The party had a slim chance in this election, considering it was only founded three months before the election with manesto launched a few weeks before the polling day and tainted by allegations against its leader Alex Salmond.Social media without a doubt played a very important part in this election, but there is a question to what extent Facebook advertising had an effect beyond ldquopreaching to the converted.Where social media will play a far more important role is cultivating the future political debates in Scotland. We need to move away from clicheacutes of ldquoisive referendums and ldquouniting the country. Referendums do not need to be isivewe learn to listen to each other, debate with respect and discuss issues that matter in a constructive manner. There is no progress without dferences in opinions, so we need to come to terms with ersity of views and cultivate a constructive democratic dialogue amongst politicians and the electorate alike.

They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3787297.jpg--.jpg?1620288585000\n","title":"seth raises 1340 for great cause","story":"A Ballymena teenager has raised more than pound for Macmillan Cancer Support after completing a half marathon at the weekend.

Credit: Mark AndersonLauren HarteTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA hotel all to yourself.That was the verdict of the flamboyant interior designer and TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, when he first set eye on this House of the Year contender.Glenmore Manor, an th-century family manor house has ed to the market with a price tag of around £,.Currently set up as a luxury holiday let and BB, this period mansion has been lovingly restored and renovated by its proud owners, Pat and Eileen Hanna, who have worked hard to retain many of its original features while also offering some more modern conveniences.While Glenmore already boasts magnicent surroundings, the couple have added many incredible additions throughout, such as a gazebo, the Sapphire walkway and Tuscan barbecue area.The period property has a fascinating history.It was originally built in  by local solicitor Seamus Adair, who worked for a number of the local merchants and mill owners.Adair built the home on  acres and commissioned fireplaces from internationally renowned Scottish architects, the Adams brothers, who also furnished numerous palaces across Europe.The archetypal red brick exterior features classic bay windows and ornamental brickwork, in keeping with the Gothic revival movement that marked Victorian architecture.This decorative flare continues through the other features of the exterior, such as the ornate terracotta ridge tiles and decorative wooden trim. Sash windows and an elaborately designed porch complete the style.The interior features a grand entrance hall, formal staircase and a dining room with open fireplaces and two drawing rooms. Every room has views of the surrounding gardens.The large kitchen is the heart of the home and this one perfectly marries old and new worlds together.It leads to the comfortable sunroom, looking into the indoor heated swimming pool, complete with sauna, hot tub and changing facilities.The six large refined bedrooms feature traditional decor, and most offer private or en suite bathrooms.Some also have flat-screen TVs, garden views and four poster beds.Other amenities include a -personroom, a guest lounge and a patio leading to mature gardens with the covered barbecue area, a pond and meditation hut.Two separate stables have been converted into two-bedroom apartments.Indeed when it featured on the BBC’s House of the Year programme back in January , presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen described Glenmore Manor as “like your own hotel, with all the facilities just for you”.Estate agent, Martin Anderson, said this stately and elegant country house represents a very rare opportunity on the market.“To put it concisely, it is nothing short of special,” he added. “Set on an extremely large site, the house is surrounded by beautully designed gardens featuring a classical water fountain, thoughtfully placed brick paved walkways, and mature trees on all sides providing complete privacy. These elements combine to make the site feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of the town.”Situated on Lough Road in Lurgan, Glenmore is an eight-minute walk from the train station and  minutes from Lord Lurgan Memorial Park.For the full listing visit propertynewsBelfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Rory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Rory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy credits ‘awesome’ caddie Harry Diamond with crucial decision on th hole to close out Wells Fargo Championship winTop VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern IrelandCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionJohn SimpsonOpinionCounting the cost of pandemic borrowingVast swathes of forest and bog lost to fires last yearNovember date for P pupils to sit transfer testAverage NI house price rises sharply to £,LatestCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionOld Firm B-team scheme is ‘big plus’ for young Scotland players – Steven GerrardLitter campaign Tory MP who dropped cigarette butt accused of hypocrisyTymal Mills says initiatives are more important to cricket than taking a kneeStudents killed in shooting at Russian school,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: GettyAllan PrestonTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFor Rory McIlroy and we Erica, the main order of business after celebrating his first win in  months was to comfort their eight-month old daughter Poppy.It was all too much for the tot, who found herself surrounded by cheering fans at the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina.Several well-known local parents told the Belfastthe public meltdown was a touching moment that seemed all too familiar.Two-time Olympic boxing bronze medallist Paddy Barnes recalled fleeing a restaurant when his daughter Eireann was two.I remember having my daughter out in Nando’s and she just squealed the place down,” he said.These two girls were coming over to me to help, but I just took her and split because everyone was looking at us.I felt really paranoid, because I felt like people were wanting us to shut up even though they were trying to help.I was just in a panic, I left with my dinner on the table. Now,my kids are crying, I wouldn’t mind as much because I’ve got more experience.”He added: “If I ever see parents with their kids crying out in public I just laugh because I can relate. There’s nothing you can do about it, it’s not the parents’ fault. Kids cry and there’s often nothing you can do about it.”On McIlroy, he said: “He’s very successful, so no doubt his baby will soon get used to it.”BBC presenting couple Connor Phillips and Holly Hamilton welcomed their son Fionn in January. Already behaving like a seasoned media professional, Connor said Fionn behaved perfectly at a recent event where his parents were working.He said: He times his little strops very well, just to make sure mummy and daddy look good. He has his moments too and can be a little a, so we do a lot of walking around the shore.Just today we were about a mile away from home and he unexpectedly woke up and he just wasn’t going back to sleep, full stop.”Asked how he deals with the stress of an upset child in public, he said: “I think back to my parentless self and think of how I might have reacted to seeing that. I might have rolled my eyes. But now as parents you go: ‘My God, the parents that have gone before me are absolute heroes’.I do think it’s the best thing in the world, though. He had a strop on the beach today and when we sat him up, he just seemed to say: ‘Thank you for that mummy and daddy’.”On McIlroy, he said: “I’m sure people think he has nannies and au pairs doing all the work. But I doubt that very much, I’m sure he’s a Holywood boy at heart looking after his wee man. I now have % empathy with parents, they’re terric, especially mums!” Comedians Diona Doherty and Sean Hegarty welcomed their daughter Winter five weeks ago. The Derry Girls and Give My Head Peace actress said feeling safe while out in public during the pandemic had been her biggest obstacle.“Today was the first day I took my daughter to the shopping centre, which was quite daunting. I know other parents who had babies during lockdown but haven’t really been anywhere for six months. That’s probably even scarier,” she said.Diona gave birth while having Covid, but now feels somewhat safer that both of them have some immunity.Any time we’re out for a walk it’s the same, it’s been cut short. Our baby has a set of lungs on her. Luckily I’m breastfeeding, so I can console her quite quickly. But you’re always planning ahead for the quickest route back.”Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Rory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Rory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy credits ‘awesome’ caddie Harry Diamond with crucial decision on th hole to close out Wells Fargo Championship winTop VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern IrelandBallymurphy Massacre inquest findings set to be publishedCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionDoug Beattie vows to challenge DUPhe becomes new UUP leaderJohn SimpsonOpinionCounting the cost of pandemic borrowingVast swathes of forest and bog lost to fires last yearLatestBallymurphy Massacre inquest findings set to be publishedNine-year-old Dubai DJ scratches her way to fame in world contestCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionImpact of virus crisis on young people’s job prospects confirmedCovid- deaths in England and Wales lowest since mid-September,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Suzanne BreenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen -year-old Kate Nicholl arrived in Belfast with her mother having fled Zimbabwe, she never dreamed she would end up its Lord Mayor. “My mum had £ in her purse. Without the help of the Gingerbread charity for single parents, I don’t know how we’d have coped,” she says. “We got a flat on the th floor of Riverdale House tower block in Dunmurry. It all seemed very grey. My whole world had collapsed. My parents’ marriage had broken up previously, and now we had left our home and were in a dferent country.When our belongings were shipped over, someone set fire to the boxes outside the flat. We literally lost everything, including photographs. I found it all very traumatic.”In three weeks’ time Katewill be installed as Belfast’s new Alliance Lord Mayor. The daughter of a Northern Ireland artist and a writer and ex-model from a family of anti-apartheid activists in South Africa, her story is extraordinary.“My mum and dad met at a house party in London in the s,” she says. “They were both hippies. My dad Kenneth was an artist from Holywood in Co Down. My mum, who was from Capetown, was working as a nanny.“They were both liberal and bohemian, and had found the places they’d grown up extremely restrictive. It was a whirlwind romance, but my mum Helen had to go back to South Africa as her visa was about to expire.“Back in Capetown, she wanted toto London. My grandparents, very sensibly, refused to fund a trip for their -year-old daughter to hook up with a man she’d just met. My mum had been an artists’ model and had sat for a well-known painter. She sold the portrait to buy a plane ticket to London to be with dad.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate Nicholl at school in Zimbabwe FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate Nicholl at school in ZimbabweThe couple got married and moved to Brighton. But, for some reason, they decided toto Northern Ireland where Kate’s brother Daniel and sister Ciara were born. Kenneth worked as an art teacher, and Helen secured a job in the children’s department of Robinson and Cleaver.“In  they decided they couldn’t stay here any longer,” Kate says. “The violence and sectarianism was too much. They didn’t want their children growing up in a segregated environment.“My dad started writing to dferent countries to see where he might get a job. Zimbabwe was this newly independent country that needed teachers. My parents were very excited about what Robert Mugabe stood for. It was also close to South Africa for my mum to visit her family.”The Nicholls moved to Harare before settling in the small farming town of Marondera. Kate was born there six years later. “It was a wonderful and magical childhood in so many ways,” she says.“My dad was the art teacher in the local school, and my mum the librarian. My parents were very creative and had interesting friends. There was a lot of sport — swimming and canoeing down the Zambezi.There was endless bushland to roam around. It was the most stunning landscape. I can still see the night sky with stars that seemed to go on forever. I can smell the sweet scent of the jacaranda trees in bloom.“But it was a strange environment as well. There was a lot of racism. It was very unusual for a white family like ours to have black friends. I was the only white child at school who had black classmates over to stay at the weekend. It was a totally unnatural society.”In South Africa, Kate’s grandmother had been in the Black Sash, an organisation of white women which campaigned against apartheid. They would wear black sashes to symbolise mourning for the death of democracy.Kate’s brother left Zimbabwe for university in Capetown, and her sister went to college in Belfast. Her parents’ marriage then broke up, and her father also ed to Northern Ireland.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate with husband Fergal Sherry FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate with husband Fergal Sherry“It was just me and mum left,” she says. “The political situation started to get really tense. White farmers were being abducted and beaten. David Stevens, the father of a school friend, was shot dead.There were food and fuel shortages, and riots.My mum drove to town to fill her car with petrol. She waited two hours in a queue but, when she got to the front, there was none left.“She came home to find the electricity was out in another power cut. In a dark, empty house, she reached for the phone, and the lines were down. So she got into bed with a bottle of gin and decided it was time for us to leave.”When her parents had arrived in Zimbabwe, it was “a country full of political hope”, Kate says. “As a child, I wrote in my diary that Robert Mugabe was my hero. As things deteriorated, I scribbled that out and replaced him with Nelson Mandela.“Mugabe did some incredible things, but there were a lot of awful things too. Land reform was definitely needed, but he didn’t go about it the right way.There was brutality and massacres. Elections were rigged and corruption was widespread.“Land seizures destroyed the economy. Middle-class whites like us left. It was poor black Zimbabweans who were hardest hit. This beautul country, and its long-suffering people, deserved so much better.”And so in , Kate and Helen Nicholl moved into their flat in Dunmurry. “My mother is an extraordinary woman,” she says. “At  years old, with no money, no job and no friends, she was starting all over again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate with her son Cian FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate with her son Cian“Being a white African is textbook privilege. I grew up where people had horses and huge farms. But I do know what it’s like not to have money, and to worry about it. I know that le can change very quickly and you have to rely on the support and kindness of others, and being welcomed and embraced.”Kate was sent to the very middle-class Methodist College where family and financial circumstances combined to make her feel “like an outsider for years”. Eventually, she settled in.“My mum got a job in the War On Want bookshop in Botanic Avenue. It didn’t pay well, but she loved it. She built up a friendship circle with volunteers and customers. They became a second family to me.“We moved to Sunnyside Street, off the Ormeau Road, where a Georgian piano player lived next door. When she practised, we imagined ourselves to be sitting on the veranda in Marondera at dusk, listening to my sister play.”After her A-levels Kate moved in with her dad, who had cancer, to help nurse him. She then decided to go to university in London: “I still felt an outsider in Northern Ireland because of my background and accent, and I had every intention of never ing to live here again.“I decided to study anthropology because my favourite uncle in South Africa was an anthropologist, and he had the best stories. I thought I’d love London, but every time I came back to Northern Ireland to visit my family I realised that this place was home. Belfast was where I belonged.”After graduation Kate moved back here permanently. She started waitressing, and applied to do a law conversion course at Queen’s University. She also wrote to Alliance South Belfast MLA Anna Lo askingshe could do work experience in her office.Kate identied strongly with the politician from Hong Kong as someone like her who had come from abroad to make Northern Ireland her home: “She was the first person I voted for.“I respected her pro-choice stance on abortion at a time when not many people here held that position. Anna agreed to have me in for a day a week, and that turned into two days, and then it became the entire week.“A full-time job came up. I applied, got it, and forgot all about the law course. I never intended to join Alliance. I didn’t think I was suited to being a member of any political party as I was very much my own woman and I always thought it would limit me.“But the  flag protests changed my mind. They were a cynical and orchestrated move by loyalists, apparently in response to a democratic decision taken by the council, but really because Naomi Long had won the Westminster seat in East Belfast.“I saw Alliance’s office in Carrickfergus burnt down. I saw the home of a young councillor couple attacked as their baby slept inside. I decided to join the party to show solidarity with these brave and dignied people.”In  Kate was co-opted onto Belfast City Council. At the election three years later she topped the poll in the Balmoral ward. On a night out with an SDLP member in the Duke of York pub in Belfast city centre, she met her future husband, “GAA-mad accountant from Aghadrumsee in Co Fermanagh” Fergal Sherry.“I tapped this boy on the shoulder and asked him to take a photo of us on my phone. He did, and as he handed it back to me he remarked that we followed each other on Twitter. Apparently, we’d had quite a strong clash of opinion on something. We still have dferent views on certain issues, but we share similar values.“Fergal proposed in Zimbabwe in a small game reserve I’d visited on school trips. We were on top of a rock overlooking the savanna at sunset. It was perfect. I felt like I’d come full circle with my old and new lives.”The couple have a one-year-old son, Cian. “He’s had a political baptism of fire,” Kate says. “He attended his first council committee meeting at four weeks.He was breastfed in the chamber at seven weeks, and was in a BBC studio at eight weeks as we discussed the trolling I’d received for taking him into the chamber the previous week.”Kate has been chosen as a running-mate for Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw in South Belfast in next year’s Assembly election.The party will be hoping that public exposure from being Lord Mayor will enhance her chances. It’s a fascinating constituency with the SDLP, Alliance, Sinn Fein, DUP and Greens currently each holding a seat.The SDLP will also be aiming to follow up on Claire Hanna’s spectacular Westminster win in  by having two MLAs elected. The Sinn Fein or Green seats would appear to be the most vulnerable.Kate says poverty is an issue high on her agenda. “It has grown during Covid, and there must be a long-term Government plan to tackle systemic injustice. It’s not just about handing out food parcels.If your washing-machine has broken, and your kids can’t go to school in clean clothes, a food parcel won’t help you. If you live in an empty house, it’s a bed and sofa you need, not a food parcel.“And no politician should ever have their photo taken outside a food bankthey’re not working to address the causes of inequality.”Kate says digital poverty is also an issue: “As we live more and more online, the internet should be free to everyone. Families don’t need one device per household.They need devices for all their children, they need money for electricity and data.”Her theme as Lord Mayor will be ‘Our Belfast’, she says: “We are one community and we have one city. We need to shine a light on its people and organisations, and instil a sense of collective responsibility.We must make sure the marginalised, and those who feel outsiders, know it’s their city too.For many people, Belfast is still steeped in the past and the Troubles. But for me, it’s a place of sanctuary.It’s somewhere I started my le over again. It’s a resilient, warm and welcoming city. I am delighted to call it my home, and I will be so proud to be its Lord Mayor.”Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Rory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Rory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy credits ‘awesome’ caddie Harry Diamond with crucial decision on th hole to close out Wells Fargo Championship winTop VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern IrelandCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionJohn SimpsonOpinionCounting the cost of pandemic borrowingVast swathes of forest and bog lost to fires last yearNovember date for P pupils to sit transfer testAverage NI house price rises sharply to £,LatestCulloden to open doors to major art exhibitionLitter campaign Tory MP who dropped cigarette butt accused of hypocrisyTymal Mills says initiatives are more important to cricket than taking a kneeStudents killed in shooting at Russian schoolChurch artefacts likely to be removed following contested heritage guidance,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly.

They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I can fully appreciate how much of a challenge the past year has been for our businesses across a wide range of sectors, and I look forward to the weeks ahead when we hope to see more of those sectors reopening and ing to a more normal operation of business,” said the Mayor.     Once again I would just like to encourage everyone to support local across the district as much as you can.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mairead Healy, who is originally from Meenan Park in the Bogside area, was successful in last Thursdays council election in Romsey, a town with a population of around , people which is located seven miles from Southampton in the south of England. Speaking after her success, she said her thoughts were with her late mother Frances, brother and grandmother. She said: “I am over the moon that the people of Romsey have placed their trust in me to represent them for the Labour Party. googletag.cmd.push “As most people who know me will know, I’m not there simply to make up the numbers and I’m looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting stuck in - and maybe shaking things up a bit too.” She added: “For now, feeling so incredibly blessed and grateful to so many people who believed in me and who got out on the streets in the hail, wind and rain to canvas for me and the rest of the Romsey candidates. Thank you. “I’m also thinking about my mum, my wee brother Eamonn and my granny. It’s days like these when you really feel their absence, as they have missed out on so many of me and my sister Orla Oacute hEacuteiliacute’s big le events. googletag.cmd.push “But I’ve no doubt they have been watching over us from heaven and helping us along the way from up above.” Mairead left Derry  years ago to study law in the UK and has held several important positions, starting off her career working for the European Commission in Brussels. She then worked in human rights in London before making a career change and moving to Dublin to lead a national youth charity for several years. After that, she moved to the south of England where she was chief executive of a youth mental health service and was appointed to the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, a role she has recently stepped down from.     Currently, she works for a major international human rights organisation where she is part of the leadership team. She is also a postgrad student at Cambridge, training to be a child therapist and is head of safeguarding with Amnesty International UK, a post she has held since September . She said being brought up in Derry during The Troubles and the events of Bloody Sunday inspired her to get involved in struggles for justice and become an advocate for those without a voice. She said: “Growing up in the ’s as a working class Catholic from the Bogside during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, I was very much aware of the civil rights struggle affecting my community, particularly as the events of Bloody Sunday took place just a few streets from my home, where civil rights demonstrators were murdered by the British army. “As a result, it instilled in me from a young age a strong desire to be involved in struggles for justice and advocating for those without a voice. “In addition, as an adult, I also experienced some le changing events through the loss of some of my close family members in traumatic circumstances, which also affected my decision to campaign on particular areas of inequality.” She added she was really privileged to be able to work with and volunteer with ious communities over the years including Traveller groups, survivors of institutional abuse, refugees, iniduals who, she said, were homeless, young people and iniduals whose human rights are denied to them. She added: “As a result, I strongly believe in the value of grassroots capacity building to ensure that those without a voice can be supported to advocate for themselves and ensure their voices are heard and represented in decision making.” She explained her reasons for standing for election. “It goes without saying that the implications of the pandemic will be felt for many years to come and there will be signicant economic consequences of this, combined with Brexit. “I want to play my part in ensuring our communities are supported in the years ahead, which is why I am putting myself forward as a candidate.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me. He made things very straight forward and it didnrsquot take long for me to get the hang of things.The rider credits the first big moment of his blossoming career to when he rode the   shot Nietzsche, trained by Brian Ellison, to first place in the grade three Greatwood Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham when he was just  in November .ldquoIt was something that was unexpected and maybe came a bit out of the blue. It really helped my career and put me on the radar to a lot of people.Danny has ridden a number of horses on his path to success but does share a special bond with one in particular.ldquoNuts Well is my favourite horse. We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

These exams were in speech and drama and acting.Clare said: ldquoFor the speech and drama grades the pupils have the opportunity to study poetry and stories. They learn to recite these with confidence, clear expression and articulation.ldquoThey learn how to discuss their work with the examiner and it is wonderful to watch their communication skills develop. It is amazing to see how each of these pupils have developed in confidence and the exams are a wonderful way to mark this achievement.ldquoAs pupils progress through the grades, they learn so much about how the voice works along with literary techniques which, in turn, helps them with literacy and English at school.She continued: ldquoSome senior pupils chose to do the acting pathway which involved them studying plays and monologues and understand how to develop characterisation, all the while enhancing their voice, movement, gesture and facial expression.ldquoThe acting exams are very like the audition process which some of the pupils have taken part in before for local casting agents. They all worked extremely hard last term and were all very deserving of their results.

Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay. Minister Poots must publish this strategy as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the petition urging a ban on the sale of disposal barbecues in shops and supermarkets is gathering increasing support.The resident behind the petition said that every year a number of businesses push the the sale of cheap, disposable barbecues, which are frequently taken to be used in parks and green spaces, often without the landowners permission.ldquoIn many cases, having already scorched the ground below, these barbecues are frequently left, giving rise to wild fires. Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great. These cheap, lightweight disposable barbecues, are not to be socially acceptable any longer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Rosaleen.jpg","title":"Rosaleen praises family on her 100th birthday  ","story":"BORN the day before Northern Ireland came into being  years ago, Rosaleen Rogan celebrated her centenary in style on Sunday.The long and happy le of the devoted parishioner was celebrated at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught with a special Mass dedicated to her by the parish priest, Father Brendan Smyth.The mother-of-five, grandmother to  and great-grandmother to  was greeted by her family and friends staggered throughout the day after the service and at home.Said by her family to ldquostill buzzing on Monday, Mrs Rogan was overwhelmed by the amount of cards, flowers and Mass bouquets given to her to mark her momentous day.As May  in  was recently decreed as the day Northern Ireland was constituted, Mrs Rogan, who lives with her daughter, Mrs Stella Rea in Magheralone, is one of the last surviving Irish-born citizens in Northern Ireland.Her th birthday was recognised by both states with a card from the Queen and a letter from Irish President Michael D Higgins along with a cheque for pound,.Mrs Rogan was also very touched to have been sent a Papal blessing, which was a gt from the parish organised by Fr Smyth, and a letter of congratulations from the Lord Lieutenant of Down, Mr David Lindsay.She was also delighted to receive a visit from family friend and former South Down MP, Baroness Margaret Ritchie who helped the family mark the birthday.Mrs Rogan, who hails from Annacloy, was also joined on Sunday by her two surviving brothers, Joe and Maurice McGrath, with their wives and her sister Marie at the Mass.She is the widow of the late Joe Rogan, a well-known shoemaker and repairer in Drumaness, and often helped him with stitching jobs in the business over the years.The couple shared a devotion to their faith and celebrated  years of marriage on September .

This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12593179.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I had a long chat a couple of weeks ago with an old UUP friend who was complaining about a recent interview in which I had said the UUP was still dogging the DUP’s footsteps.By Alex KaneMonday, th May , : pm  \"       \"  ]]I called him yesterday: “So, the DUP has a leadership contest and now the UUP is having one.” There was a pause: “Fair enough, Alex, can we talk about Sherlock Holmes instead ”The news about Steve Aiken came as no surprise. The sheer volume of internal complaints about him suggested his time was up. I’ll join together two comments I heard yesterday afternoon: ‘His removal was properly conducted, unlike the surgical removal of Arlene Foster or the Sinn Fein purge in Foyle.after hard conversations there wasn’t exactly a chorus suggesting he hang on any longer.’ The problem with Aiken – although in almost any other walk of le it wouldn’t count as a problem – is that he was much too nice to lead a political party. Particularly one as dficult to lead as the UUP has been since Terence O’Neill’s era. He is a decent man with a brisk, efficient, managerial approach to problems. But that’s not what the UUP needed this last  months. And it’s certainly not what party members – who do the hard slog of elections and door-knocking – wanted.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...UUP members viewed Steve Aiken’s media interviews sometimes with quiet despair and occasionally utter disbeliefThey wanted someone who would land a few powerful blows on the DUP: and particularly on Arlene Foster. There’s still a section of the party which has never forgiven either her or Donaldson for defecting to the DUP and that section has been enjoying a feeling of schadenfreude as it read about her travails this past year. Or, as a -year-old, Trimble-supporting member of the party texted me when he heard that the DUP had thrown her overboard: ‘Slap it up her. She should have known they would turn on her at some point.’Members and supporters voters of a party want to hear the leader do well in interviews. They want to feel buoyed-up and able to punch the air: particularlythey feel the leader they support has acquitted himself well. Aiken’s innate politeness prevented him from having many of those moments. Too often his supporters were just shrugging their shoulders and sighing: mostly in quiet despair, but occasionally in utter disbelief. Reg Empey stood down as leader after the UCUNF projectfailed to deliver any seats at the  general election. Tom Elliott lasted  months. Mike Nesbitt survived for five yearsbut stood down after a terrible Assembly result in . Robin Swann stayed for  months. Aiken, who officially resigns this morning at am, managed  months.Empey and Nesbitt both took risks to try and give the UUP something which could be described as signicantly dferent from the DUP . Both paid the price: but maybe it was more timing than anything . The DUP mocked the UCUNF pact, yet cut their own one with the Conservatives a few years later . In an interview for Brian Rowan’s new book, ‘Political Purgatory’Nesbitt noted: “I judged there was insufficient electoral support for my call for a post sectarian election and rather than try to hang on to the leadership and risk undoing five years of effort to unite my party, I resigned before the counts were even complete, so members could focus on the future. Since then, many people have told me I was too early, ahead of my time. Watching the so-called Alliance surge of , I wonderall I got wrong was the timing.’Nesbitt makes a fair point. That said, I still think he’s missing a key truth about the UUP: it is not – and hasn’t been so for a long, long time – a single, united party. It is still like a collection of smaller parties and competing interests and prone to taking sides when the leadertakes a stand on an issue. Ironically, the DUPis experiencing exactly the same dficulties: and may continue to do so , which seems inevitable, the new leader enjoys the support of just over half of the electoral college.All of which raises the only question that matters: what does a new leader do to give the UUP the something ‘signicantly dferent’ it needs to attract both media interest and new votes  Maybe a second question: , for example, the new leader wanted to widen the chasm between his party and the DUP, would a substantial, convincing majority of party members let him  Many recent leaders have fallen at the hurdle represented by that second question. Crucially, is there someone in the UUP who,he won the leadership, would not be afraid to make his own case and face down both internal and external opponents. Someone who would say: “This is what I want to do. If you elect me as leader then it is what I will do – so don’t pretend to be surprised afterwards when I start doing it.”If that person doesn’t exist, then it won’t be long until the party doesn’t, either.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The bypass could have cut congestion in Dinas too, a current problem.The wider Dinas transport project has cost pound,, mostly from Welsh Government, but including pound, from the Vale council.Councillor Peter King, cabinet member for transport, said: ldquoWelsh Government is moving very much away from road building into tackling climate change, which I really find some dficulty objecting to.ldquoIt has always frustrated me that the work was seen as the Dinas Powys bypass.

One project that could go ahead includes a cycle route from Newport to Barry.Cllr King said: ldquoWe think we can probably pursue some of [wider work] through the city region, and we have also been awarded money for the active travel Newport to Barry route.
