Craig’s wearing a grey sleeveless hooded top so he can head down to his own luxurious and well-appointed gym after we’re finished.At the end of our talk, I realise that I’ve been sitting in shadow the whole time, so he’s essentially been speaking to some faceless phantom with an estuary English accent. Which seems fitting, somehow, for a discussion about the shadowy, often anonymous world of cryptocurrencies.Craig, on the other hand, sits in bright light in what looks like a windowless room in a London house which he describes as opulent – and gigantic.I sense he’s still smarting a bit from the mauling he got after coming out as Satoshi, but can’t tell for sure whether this is because he’s angry about continued accusations that he lied about being the father of Bitcoin or for some other reason I can’t fathom.So I hit Craig with the one question which every journalist inevitably wants to put to him.MORE: Heartbroken families ‘lose life savings’ in catastrophic crash of Bitconnect cryptocurrency‘I never confirm or deny,’ he tells me.‘I’m getting better at this. So I’ll plead the American fifth.’He wasn’t always so coy.After investigations in Gizmodo and Wired named Craig Wright as the man behind Satoshi, he did little to deny the rumours and vowed to give the BBC ‘extraordinary proof’ of his identity.However, he did not produce this proof and was pilloried by people who accused him of lying about his role in the birth of Bitcoin. He later posted a message on his website which insisted he did not deceive the world but would not be taking steps to prove that he was the man behind Satoshi.The barracking continues to this day, with Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin calling him a ‘fraud’ earlier this week.‘I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me.‘But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.‘When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.‘I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis (founding director of The Bitcoin Foundation) and Gavin Andresen (software developer who played a key role in building software which powers Bitcoin) I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions.‘They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.’I try another tack and ask him how many Bitcoins he’s holding right now. Satoshi Nakamoto has a fortune of about 980,000 Bitcoins worth almost $20 billion, which would make him the 44th richest person in the world.‘They are sort of ephemeral so you can’t hold them,’ he says evasively.‘I have some printed as coins, but there’s only a few hundred of those.’So I try again, mistakenly asking him if he owns millions.‘Not millions, no,’ he replies. Even if he is Satoshi, this would be a true answer.Bitcoins don’t generally exist in physical form and are stored using a virtual ledger called the blockchainMORE: Bitcoin fuelling trade in elephant tranquilliser drug so strong it’s considered a chemical weaponThe key fact to remember about Satoshi’s fortune is that it’s not quite the same as having loads of traditional cash tucked away in the bank.If the person behind Nakamoto was seen to be selling his huge cryptocurrency stash, it would probably spook investors and cause a price crash which would render his fortune worthless.‘Why would anyone do that, assuming I had that kind of level of Bitcoin?’ Craig asks.‘People can speculate all they want. It’s now gone to the point where I don’t hide as much as I used to. It’s fairly public knowledge that I have money.His is mysterious crypto-fortune is used to fund investments in companies working on to ‘build the Bitcoin ecosystem’, he insists. Instead of withdrawing it all, he’s using and even adding to it with no intention to suddenly cash in his virtual coins.Since being identified as Satoshi, Craig has also built up a more visible fortune through his company NChain. Before Bitcoin, he already enjoyed a successful career in information security and programming, building the architecture for one of the earliest online casinos aged just 29.Even if he’s not Satoshi, he’s still a very rich man.This chart starts in 2010 and shows the rapid growth of Bitcoin (Graphic: Coindesk)‘I already have everything I need. I don’t think people understand this,’ he says.‘People can’t say exactly what I have, which is the nature of Bitcoin. But I have enough to have a few sports cars and a big house without a home loan.‘I have a mortgage in Australia, but money in my bank account at the same time.’He admits that being outed as Satoshi was ‘surreal’, as he went from being an academic and entrepreneur who ‘no-one cared about’ to finding journalists camped on this doorstep.‘I worry for my family,’ he admits. ‘You see things like people being kidnapped because they own Bitcoin or whatever else.’Yet there is one person who did not benefit from the Bitcoin price explosion: Craig’s former business partner.David Kleiman, who worked with Craig Wright during the dawn of Bitcoin (Picture: DavidKleiman.com)Dave Kleiman, who is to be co-creator of the world’s most important cryptocurrency, died impoverished and alone at the beginning of 2013 after apparently failing to reap the benefits of his involvement in the dawn of Bitcoin.His grisly, sad and lonely end sparked wild conspiracy theories in recent years as the price of Bitcoin soared from next to nothing to a massive $20,000 at the end of last year.Wright is now facing a lawsuit from Kleiman’s brother, Ira, who has accused the crypto pioneer of wrongfully seizing more than $5billion worth of Bitcoin from Dave’s estate.‘He was my friend,’ Wright says sadly, his voice beginning to falter.‘This will probably come out anyway. The US government knows it all already.’Ira Kleiman’s court filings state that his brother and Wright shared a ‘mutual obsession with cryptography and data security’.‘It is unclear whether Craig, Dave, andor both created Bitcoin,’ it continues.‘For reasons not yet completely clear, they chose to keep their involvement in Bitcoin hidden from most of their family and friends. It is undeniable, however, that Craig and Dave were involved in Bitcoin from its inception and that they both accumulated a vast wealth of bitcoins from 2009 through 2013.’Bitcoin soared in price during 2017 to almost $20,000 before plunging down to under $7,000 at the time of writing in a cryptocurrency ‘bloodbath’ (Picture: Getty Metro.co.uk)Dave Kleiman was left wheelchair-bound following a major motorcycle accident in 1995.After contracting MRSA from infected bed sores, he spent the last few years of his life in and out of hospitals.Finally, in 2013, he allegedly told doctors to ‘go fuck themselves’, checked himself out and went back to his home in Palm Beach CountyThe computer genius died a month later in poverty, facing the foreclosure of his house.According to a report from the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner Office, his body was found decomposing and blood and faecal matter was detected in his wheelchair tracks.His house was scattered with open bottles of alcohol and a loaded handgun was found next to him.Although Kleiman’s mattress had a bullet hole in it, there were no empty cases in the house, ruling out suicide, and coroners said MRSA had stopped his heart.‘Dave was in hospital and had been left too long, so ended up with infected bed sores and all sorts of problems,’ Craig says.‘Things were getting it worse and I don’t think people there really cared.‘At the end of it, he got sick of the pain and checked himself out without telling anyone.’KFC is one of many firms which now accept Bitcoin for certain purchases (Credit: Getty Rex)He tells me Kleiman died in poverty because his money was seized during an investigation into a Costa Rica-based Bitcoin exchange called Liberty Reserve, which was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges.‘Early in 2013, the Americans sized Liberty Reserve and seized all funds there, saying these guys fund drugs and terrorism and everything like that. Which, so do banks, honestly.‘When it was shut down, all his money was seized.‘Dave had a lot of Bitcoins. But they were… wherever Dave left his Bitcoins.’Kleiman reportedly carried a USB drive at all times, although this has not been confirmed. If this did contain a fortune in Bitcoin, opening up could prove impossible because it is likely to be locked down using strong encryption.Craig Wright speaking to the BBC (Photograph: BBC News)Ira Kleiman’s court case alleges Wright ‘perpetrated a scheme against Dave’s estate to seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the Bitcoin technology’.It continues: ‘As part of this plan, Craig forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig andor companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave’s signature on them.’I ask Craig if was upset by the allegations and feels hurt.He responds: ‘I do in many ways. Yes.’We sit in silence for a moment after Craig shares his sadness about the death of Dave Kleiman, who was a ‘good friend’.The tragedy is compounded by the sad fact that Kleiman never got to see Bitcoin explode in price and even begin gain a measure of mainstream acceptance.Nowadays, everyone from Paris Hilton to the bra entrepreneur Michelle Mone is investing in cryptocurrencies, while banks and financial organisations are rushing to see how they can make even more money by taking part in this emerging economy.It wasn’t always like this. In its infancy, Bitcoin’s advocates imagined it would become a global currency which would liberate us from the tyranny of mighty governments and central banks, freeing citizens by effectively allowing them to become their own bank.Craig says he’s a libertarian, but ‘pragmatic’ enough that it hasn’t stopped him working for government agencies.‘You have a lot of anarchists talking about Bitcoin because they think they can build a system without central banks, overthrow the government and all the rest.Since Bitcoin was released, a number of other crytocurrencies including TrumpCoin have been unleashed (Credit: AP, Bitcoin)He believes Bitcoin can make banks and governments a ‘little more honest’, because their transactions are visible because they are recorded on the blockchain, but does not believe it will bring about some kind of utopia.‘You have to be realistic. We have the opportunity to open up global free trade with Bitcoin and it gives us the ability save money without it being taken, because it’s pseudonymous and we can save money in an account no-one knows about.‘Bitcoin is a tool and like all tools it can be used for good or bad.‘Hammers can be used to make a set of shelves. Hammers can be used to beat someone.‘It’s how you use a tool that matters.’Three teenage boys charged over stabbing of 13-year-old boy in east London14 dead after bus carrying junior hockey team crashes on way to match in Canada‘Why would anyone do that?’ he asks.‘If you want a system to be built on truth and start trying to get people to understand, what’s better: a scenario where people blindly follow you because of a name or a slow battle where you convince people using facts, mathematics and science?‘I’ll tell you that people don’t learn if you come out there and build a cult of followers. They spout what you say, but don’t understand it.‘That’s a Church of Satoshi, for heck’s sake. It’s even been ided in a Protestant and Catholic schism.’‘At the end of all this, Bitcoin isn’t a universal saviour. The only thing that will save humanity is humanity.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_6120272.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"dont stress yogas not thing now can goat pilates","story":"As strange as it may sound, yoga with goats is nothing new.Doing downward dog as a goat wanders beside your mat has been a thing since back in 2016, first in farms in the US, then eventually in special classes in Europe.What is new, however, is goat pilates, which has some subtle differences.The first goat pilates class in the UK has taken off at a former dairy farm in Marlborough Downs, created by Laura Corbett.Laura breeds the pedigree goat kids on her farm. After seeing videos of goats standing on people’s backs during yoga classes, she was inspired to bring the joy of goats into the pilates studio.(Picture: SWNS)She uses young goats rather than fully grown ones, as kids prefer to interact with humans, enjoying being nestled in and stroked.The people doing the pilates get the endorphins of having a good stretch, plus the release of all the feel-good hormones that come from spending time with cute animals.‘The kids are like puppies with beautiful long ears and silky coats – always seeking attention,’ says Laura.(Picture: SWNS)‘Goats have inidual characters and connect with us by looking at us in the eye, so no-one can help but fall in love with them.‘They playfully jump and climb on top of you, lightly nibble your clothes and hair, taking real interest in each participant.”Providing great therapy and an enjoyable experience, which can’t help but make you smile.’The classes can take up to 16 (human) participants, and start by having everyone stand on mats in a barn as the goats are brought in.(Picture: SWNS)The goats are free to roam around and get comfortable as the group warms up, and are then able to climb on people as they stretch. Because they’re kids, they’re light enough to stand on people’s backs without causing discomfort.‘We can only use the baby kids because they are small and agile,’ explains Laura.‘They are between three and six weeks of age, any older and they become too heavy and develop horns that can be quite sharp.’That means the classes can’t run year round, instead taking running for three weeks annually while the goats are young.MORE: Why you need to exercise your feet and ankles if you want to run properlyMORE: Tracksuit berets are now a thingMORE: ASOS drops its first ever fitness range, ASOS 4505"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tesco-bottles.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"people fuming tescos meal deals smaller bottle coca cola","story":"(Picture: Tescometro.co.uk)Not content with ruining Irn-Bru and Lucozade, the sugar tax has wreaked further havoc on our enjoyment of fizzy drinks.As a way to deal with the price hike, all the standard 500ml of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in Tesco have been swapped to a 375ml version.That’s a big deal, because those are the bottles that are now part of the lunchtime meal deal, meaning you now get less sugary goodness as part of your lunch break.But the real travesty here is this: Despite the shrinkage of the bottle, the price of Tesco’s lunchtime meal deal remains £3.Yep, you’re paying the same thing for less fizzy drink to sip. This is an outrage.The change happened with the official start of the sugar tax, presumably as a way to deal with the increase on the price of Pepsi and Coca-Cola – neither of which have changed their recipes, instead choosing to up the price.It’s not just meal deals that are affected. It looks like we’re entirely unable to buy 500ml bottles of Coca-Cola from Tesco, with all of them being replaced with the 375ml bottles, still for £1.30 each.Before you start charging to Tesco’s holding signs with ‘GIVE US BACK OUR FIZZY DRINKS’, it’s worth noting that it’s unlikely Tesco will be the only supermarket offering a smaller drink with your meal deal.Supermarkets selling Coca-Cola and Pepsi as part of their meal deals will face a choice: Either increase the price of their deals to include the tax (which would p*ss customers off), or include smaller bottles of fizzy drink as part of the current offer (which, clearly, would also p*ss customers off).That means we’re all left with our own choice of how we will respond to this horror.We can accept our smaller drinks and enjoy sticking to a £3 budget for lunch.We can swap to a big bottle of water if we’re thirsty.Or if we’re really determined to polish off a large bottle of Coke midway through our day, we’ll need to pay extra and head to a different aisle to get a 2 litre bottle, letting go of the joy of a meal deal entirely.This is life now, thanks to the sugar tax. It’s going to take us a while to adjust.MORE: Is the sugar tax just an exercise in babying adults?MORE: The sugar tax is a good thing, but it won’t solve all our diet problems"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/05/14/4AD6A43700000578-5579833-The_heir_to_the_British_throne_in_Australia_for_the_opening_of_t-a-4_1522934335592.jpg","title":"Prince Charles discusses carrying toilet seat Australia","story":"    Prince Charles was heard swearing during a radio interview after presenters asked him to address rumours he carries his own toilet seat with him when he travels overseas.

Sexist producers or feeble women who lack the confidence and guts to compete? Nowhere is this more striking than on topical panel shows like Have I got News For You - just starting its 55th series.From the very beginning, the teams have been hosted by writer and satirist Ian Hislop and comedian Paul Merton. Hislop is cheery, consistently snappy and savage with his put-downs, Merton lugubrious and surreal.There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease and some women were highly offended this week when Hislop remarked that female MP’s were reluctant to host the show- there has only been one, Anne Widdecombe.Ten male MP’s have occupied the hot seat, including Boris Johnson, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg. I was unlucky to be a panellist on the show with Ed - he made the fatal mistake of thinking he was a comedian, instead of accepting the task was to read out a script and not mess it up.Possibly his success on Strictly had over-inflated his ego, but the result was painful in the extreme.Would I have done a better job? Most definitely - but I’m not interested in maintaining order and having to appear neutral, I prefer to be an irritant and spar with the others.          There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease           Jo Brand (who demolished the cocky blokes with some withering putdowns)Hislop is not a chauvinist but a surprising well-balanced fellow, who had the guts to say ‘women are slightly more reticent…maybe modesty makes them think ‘I can’t do that…maybe more men in public life think ‘Yes I can do that’.Politically incorrect it might be, but Hislop articulates what the scientists now tell us - men have no problem thinking they can be achievers, when they often possess minimal skills for the job.What a feeble bunch most female MP’s turn out to be - Nadine Dorries (not a shrinking violet) says she will never appear on HIGNFY again because it’s ‘too vicious, too abrasive’ adding ‘women don’t banter in that way, or very rarely…most don’t have that degree of aggression’.Compared with the Bill Clinton and Monica scandal the seedy...Share this articleTalk about condemning your own sex to mediocrity in the space of a couple of sentences, and a bit rich coming from someone who regularly takes part in the antiquated bear pit that’s the House of Commons debating chamber, where grown men shout, make silly gestures and animal noises and interrupt each other, in the name of democracy.Margaret Beckett, now in the House of Lords whimpered ‘they eat people alive who think they can compete’. These women are a disgrace to their sex - Beckett did herself no favours when she appeared on Question Time around the start of the MP’s expenses scandal, and tried to justify all her various houses and living expenses. She was mocked by a rowdy audience and failed to fight back, spineless outside her comfort zone.          Guest host Kirsty Young on Have I Got News For You          As for allegations of sexism, the producers of HIGNFY will be under enormous pressure to book more women - after the BBC launched a target of 5050 gender representationHave I Got News has been hosted by a handful of female comedians, from Jo Brand (who demolished the cocky blokes with some withering putdowns), Victoria Coren Mitchell and Kirsty Young. Miranda Hart, Jennifer Saunders, Sandi Toksvig and Tracey Ullman have all carried off the task with aplomb - they are seasoned performers, used to holding an audience in the palm of their hand. As for allegations of sexism, the producers of HIGNFY will be under enormous pressure to book more women - after the BBC launched a target of 5050 gender representation.Comedy shows are about entertainment, and if a guest (male or female) can’t deliver they won’t be asked back.I am frequently asked to appear on popular television shows by casting directors, and I know why. It’s hardly flattering, because they are ticking boxes. They will be tasked with booking the following - a young soap star, an actor who’s had ‘problems’ (either booze or drugs) and is turning their life around, an airhead reality star, a sportsperson of yesteryear and a couple of old farts who will complain and argue. Each component is chosen to appeal to a certain demographic in the audience, from brain-dead youth to frisky pensioner.Every single reality show, from The Island to Strictly, to I’m a Celebrity and Real Marigold Hotel follows these highly structured guidelines - so you get me or Anne Widdecombe or John Sargeant or Miriam Margolyes in the ill-tempered crumblie slot. Thankfully, Have I got News is one show where these rules don’t apply. You need to be smart, alert, self-deprecating and careful not to annoy your team leader. What’s not to like?One feminist writer whinged that women don’t want to appear because ‘they see how they are dealt with’. Sure, there have been some gormless silent bimbos on the show, but there have also been useless tongue-tied men.Is it beyond the wit of smart women to mount a take-over of prime time telly?

But would there have been so much generosity had people known about Naqshbandi’s past — or indeed the current controversy surrounding his family?The Naqshbandis have been given ‘core participant’ status at the forthcoming Grenfell Tower Inquiry. The list of core participants, comprising 504 bereaved relatives, survivors, and local residents, was published on March 20. Masi Naqshbandi’s name is on it, along with his parents, three brothers and sister.Being core participants means the Naqshbandis will be entitled to legal representation (and funding) at the inquiry and allowed to question witnesses, review evidence in advance and make opening and closing statements.But Masi Naqshbandi is a convicted criminal. He was jailed for seven years in 2012 for his part in one of Britain’s most notorious ‘crash-for-cash’ scams.

On the night of the blaze itself, Siar Naqshbandi (pictured) posted a two-minute video live from the scene — sparking a little confusion among his Facebook friends as to where he was living.Nevertheless, in what some might consider an almost farcical reversal of roles, Naqshbandi will be able, if he chooses, to quiz anyone who testifies at the inquiry, as if he were a solicitor or barrister.Core participant status is afforded to anyone who lived in the tower block at the time of the fire. But exactly how many members of the Naqshbandi clan did live in a three-bedroom flat in Grenfell Tower is a thorny issue. Sources at Kensington and Chelsea council have confirmed that the subject is now at the centre of a fraud investigation.It’s reported that up to 15 members of the family, including Masi Naqshbandi, have claimed to be resident in the flat before the building was destroyed last summer.Why should this matter? Because under council rules, adults who lived in the tower at the time of the fire are eligible for rehousing with their families, with all rent and utility bills waived until July 2019.So the Naqshbandis — yes, possibly as many as 15 of them — were installed, at taxpayers’ expense, in three apartments in a luxury complex just off Kensington High Street before they aroused suspicion at the council.Two blocks of affordable housing in the Kensington Row development, containing 68 flats, are now occupied by Grenfell survivors, and rightly so.The Grenfell properties have been built to the same standard as private homes in Kensington Row, where penthouse suites are being sold for up to £13 million, but have a lower internal specification.The wider narrative here is not, as some liberal voices have suggested, about snobby nimbys objecting to poorer families moving in next door, but whether many bereaved Grenfell survivors, still in hostels and other emergency accommodation, are more deserving of help than the Naqshbandis.The family denies any wrongdoing, and officials accept some of the relatives have legitimately benefited from council assistance.          Two blocks of affordable housing in the Kensington Row development, containing 68 flats, are now occupied by Grenfell survivors, and rightly so (pictured: The fire at Grenfell Tower in June last year)Kensington Row, and other sites in the borough where Grenfell residents have been moved, were provided after Theresa May came under fierce personal criticism in the wake of the Grenfell disaster.She was vilified for visiting the scene and meeting members of the emergency services, but no actual survivors. This was used by the Left as an excuse to launch a cynical and sustained onslaught against an ‘uncaring’ government.Even the most extreme elements of the Left, though, would have difficulty spinning the investigation into the Naqshbandis as an example of scapegoating the less well-off.Scotland Yard has investigated a string of fraud cases in connection with Grenfell Tower. The Naqshbandis deny any wrongdoing but Kensington and Chelsea council has passed a file on the family to the police. If anyone is found guilty of criminality they would almost certainly be removed from the Grenfell inquiry.For the moment though, a convicted conman from a family under scrutiny for alleged fraud remains a core participant.So what do we know about the Naqshbandis?The family arrived in Britain from Afghanistan in the late Nineties when their country was turned into an Islamic state under the Taliban.Patriarch Bohwuddin Naqshbandi and his wife Mariam have four sons, Rasheed, Masi, Ravi and Siar, and two daughters, Samera and Sadaf.Mr and Mrs Naqshbandi have lived in numerous properties in London with various children at one time or another. One of the most recent addresses was a three-bedroom terrace house in Bracondale Road in the borough of Greenwich, South-East London. Bohwuddin Naqshbandi, who’s in his 60s, is understood to have worked as a police officer back in his native Afghanistan.‘They were nice, friendly people who generally kept themselves to themselves,’ said one resident of Bracondale Road. ‘There were always lots of comings and goings.’The couple lived in Bracondale Road for about two years, moving out in August 2017, according to the neighbour.Maybe he got the month mixed up — an easy mistake — because by then Bohwuddin and Mariam Naqshbandi were supposed to be living in Grenfell. The fire, of course, was in June 2017.‘They told us they were moving to a “swanky new-build” in Holland Park,’ the neighbour added. ‘They said they were moving to a new place because Mariam walked with a limp and needed a more disabled-friendly property.’Again, there have may have been a misunderstanding, but the description sounds like Kensington Row, which is a few minutes from Holland Park.

The last election might have been the first in which the ‘university seats’ made a significant difference — there are now so many universities that almost 20 per cent of political constituencies have a substantial university-related vote.The growth of the graduate population is also closely linked to a trend towards iniduals becoming more liberal.Leaving home and spending several years among people of different backgrounds tends to make you more comfortable with social change and less concerned with loyalty, tradition and group attachment — the values of small-c conservatism.Surely this has contributed to the sharpness of isions in society, revealed by support for Brexit among traditionalists on the one hand, and fierce concern about equalities, human rights and identity politics among Britain’s graduate class on the other.Openness, inidual autonomy and internationalism are key values in modern universities, yet are often viewed with suspicion by ordinary voters.Indeed, the roots of the Brexit vote can be found in the sense of alienation felt by these ordinary voters, caused by what I term the ‘two masses’ — mass immigration and mass higher education.The former has increased competition for jobs and public services, while the latter has surely contributed to the declining status of non-graduate employment.For those who don’t go to university, there is a big psychological difference between seeing 15-20 per cent of your schoolmates attending and 50 per cent going.Yet some experts and policy makers such as David Willetts, who was Minister for Universities and Science in the coalition government, want to send even more people to university.          Balliol College, Oxford University. Britain has expanded its higher education system with little differentiationIn his recent book, Willetts extols the benefits of mass higher education. He argues that we should be sending 70 or even 80 per cent of school leavers to university, as is the case in Finland, Sweden and South Korea.But to expand Britain’s version of higher education in that manner surely fails to take into account both the variety of aptitudes — whether academic or practical — in the population, and the variety of needs of the modern economy.It is true, of course, that all developed countries have hugely expanded post-school and university education in recent decades.But Britain has done so with much less differentiation within higher education than other countries: it has simply expanded the form and ethos of universities that already existed.Consider the ancient spires of Oxford and the University of Bedfordshire, a new university. In both places what is offered is essentially the same — a three-year academic degree usually focused on developing analytical skills.The course will be taught by academics who see research as their primary interest. And the students will, in the main, leave home to board at the university. This is unlike most students in Europe and the U.S. who tend to go to college in their home town.Willetts regards the residential system and the focus on research as strengths of our system. In his book, he defends his own recent reforms, including the increase in tuition fees to £9,000 a year and the removal of any limit on the number of students who can go to university.But he happily turns a blind eye to other obvious problems caused by the expansion, such as dumbing down.Not only has there been a 40 per cent increase in the proportion of students getting a first in the past five years — a result of turning them into fee-paying consumers, perhaps — but there is now effectively no entry requirements at all in some of the new universities.And how do we know that all this ‘world-class research’ Willetts describes at universities is in fact world-class?In the one corner of the humanities that I know something about — immigration, race, multiculturalism — much of the academic research is barely disguised political advocacy. Education departments are often very ideological, too.But the real problem with those who are cheerleaders for the current configuration of higher education is that they tend to see it as operating in a vacuum.They seem blind to the impact rapid university expansion has had on the rest of post-school education. It has almost wiped out sub-degree technical education and eclipsed higher-level vocational education.All the prestige and financial incentives point in one direction, from the schools, that are now judged on how many people they can send to good universities, to the universities’ bottomless funding system. This is backed by the Student Loans Company and the simple Universities and Colleges Admissions Service portal, which give easy access to a national system of university education.          University of Bedfordshire. The expansion of the university sector has wiped out technical education and eclipsed higher-level vocational educationAs Professor Alison Wolf of King’s College London, who specialises in the relationship between education and the labour market, puts it: ‘In post-19 education, we are producing vanishingly small numbers of higher technician-level qualifications, while massively increasing the output of generalist bachelors’ degrees and low-level vocational qualifications.’In 2016, 332,000 people got a generalist first degree and just 6,000 completed a higher technical Higher National Diploma (HND) or Certificate (HNC).No wonder employers complain about skill shortages and hire people from abroad.The adult skills budget, covering all non-university post-school education, has been in freefall.Further education colleges which were once closely connected to local employers now do mainly remedial classroom teaching for 16- to 18-year-olds. They also commomly offer multi-purpose community provision, teaching English to immigrants, for example.University expansion has almost certainly erted some students away from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and technical courses into business, arts and social science degrees. Prior to 1992, STEM subjects would have been done at one of the 35 polytechnics that then existed, which focused on technical education.Claims for the economic success of the current university model do not stack up, either. One third of recent graduates are in non-graduate jobs and the premium that graduates get in pay is falling.Willetts’s claims that graduates are good for Britain’s productivity and exports ring hollow given the nation’s weaknesses in both those areas. It turns out that just creating lots of graduates who did the courses they fancied at 18 does not magically lead to a high-productivity economy.Of course, every parent wants their child to go to university: it signifies security and status and joining the middle class.And vocational education will never compete with the high road of A-levels and a prestigious academic university course. At university, students mingle with the next generation of managers and professionals.But combining an economic growth model in a Britain based around high employment rates and high immigration — where firms expect to able to hire and fire easily — with generalist academic training for as many people as possible, is lopsided socially and economically.The fact is that 40 per cent of all new workers have studied an irrelevant subject and an increasing proportion of graduates have poor basic skills.          David Willetts extols the benefits of mass higher education and argues we should be sending 70 or even 80 per cent of school leavers to universityDespite the rigidity of the company-based vocational training system that is so typical in Germany, for example, it helps to motivate the bottom 50 per cent of pupils in the schooling system — those who tend not to go on to university. The better they do, the better the apprenticeship scheme they can join.In Britain, by contrast, if you don’t make the cut to do A-levels — and it is usually pretty clear if you will by the age of 13 or 14 — the post-school education system has little to offer.When he was an adviser to the Thatcher government of the early Eighties, Willetts himself was instrumental in destroying the old craft-based, union-dominated apprenticeship system. But none of the mainly state-funded replacements has ever really worked and the gulf in status between vocational and academic post-school education has widened.It is not clear if the new initiatives of T-level technical qualifications at schools (will any of the bright kids do them, I wonder?) and an apprenticeship levy will change anything.We often congratulate ourselves on having become a less class-bound society in recent decades. There is some truth in that, but the debate about post-school education remains haunted by class guilt and accusations of snobbery.David Willetts, and others who have shaped policy, are so keen to not kick away the ladder and deny others some version of their own experience — grammar school and an Oxford degree in politics, philosophy and economics for Willetts — that they commit the equal and opposite sin of saying that their experience, or an inferior version of it, should be good for almost everyone.The result is a cluster of institutions that proudly bear the title of university, yet are condemned to permanent second-class status compared with the universities which truly do ‘world-class research’.Many of them do important work, much of it in professional vocational areas such as nursing, law, pharmacy and surveying. Some offer recently introduced degree apprenticeships which combine on-the-job training with degrees.So why are they forced to compete in the same league as the top tier, where they are judged by academic research standards they will never excel in?They could be in a different league, where they are judged on what they actually do.Yet any suggestion that the new universities should be called something else to illustrate their different and less academic courses usually attracts howls of anger and complaints about demotion in status.More mildly, John Raftery, Vice Chancellor of London Metropolitan University, describes the problem — with the help of a military metaphor — as how to avoid ‘tearing off the epaulettes’.But this is not about titles. It is about what institutions do. And it is clear that we have a gaping hole between research-led, academic universities and further education colleges.\u0027If these are top academics God help our students\u0027: ANDREW...Share this articleA British version of the German Fachhochschule or the American community colleges — both predominantly technical institutions — is needed to fill the big intermediate skills gap.They should be able to offer two-year courses with a practical rather than academic focus, run by teachers, not academics.If students on sub-degree technical courses develop a more academic aptitude, they should be allowed to switch to a full degree course in the same institution or a different one.To sidestep the status-ridden debate about titles, we could just call all institutions providing any kind of post-school education a university or a college.All of them, including further education colleges, could perhaps come under the umbrella of a fully-fledged university, too.Of course it must be said that our great universities are a national asset that, despite hand-wringing about visa restrictions and counting students as immigrants, attract a rising number of international students (though internationalisation can go too far).Yet expansion has amplified society’s value isions, weakened our vocational skill base and probably done little for what Christopher Lasch, the American historian and moralist, called ‘the general competence of society’. (About 20 per cent of pupils still leave school more or less illiterate and innumerate).People in the bottom half of society do not need ‘rescuing’ by spending three years at a new university.They need a better basic academic school education than most of them are getting now, and then a choice of a good non-academic vocational or technical education, or a university. Ideally both would offer a residential and stay-at-home option.For years, mass higher education has reinforced the general trend towards elevating cognitive or academic ability as the gold standard of human esteem. This may now be correcting itself as dissatisfaction with some of the lower-status universities grows.Men who graduated from the 23 lowest-performing British universities went on to earn less than those who did not go at all, according to Barnaby Lenon, a former headmaster of Harrow School, in his forthcoming book Other People’s Children.Moreover, the combination of artificial intelligence replacing a range of middling cognitive jobs, an ageing society, and a reduction in immigration after Brexit, might force us to again place more value on many essential caring and manual or technical occupations.Over-expansion of the university sector has damaged the ‘status balance’ of society.It is true that three years away at university discovering oneself and the world can be a positive, life-changing experience.It was for me, but it isn’t for everyone, and it is certainly not the only route to a happy and successful life — or the best route to a thriving economy.:Adapted from an article in Standpoint magazine.

Murlough is a rambling sand dune system, just north of where the dreamscape Mountains of Mourne ‘sweep down to the sea’, in the words of the popular song.The sand is acidic, which means mauve heathers abound where the sand is stable, along with the ubiquitous marram grass that bends in the stiff onshore breezes.In June, when the days are long, the dune hollows turn purple with the tiny flowers of heartsease pansy, and yellow with the starburst flowers of birdsfoot trefoil.

This little butterfly looks exactly like the ordinary wood white found elsewhere in the UK, but has now been separated from its cousin and named as a new species.Great flocks of brent geese overwinter in Murlough Bay, and at this time of year the shoreline is haunted by huge flocks of lapwings, oystercatchers, golden plovers, dunlins and godwits, all swirling and calling away.In spring, skylarks ascend over the dunes, singing their song high above our heads.The Great Orme, North WalesThis is a place of pilgrimage for naturalists: a natural paradise, towering aloof above the holiday resort of Llandudno. Try finding a botanist or a butterfly enthusiast who hasn’t been there, or at least doesn’t desperately want to visit.It is also on the birders’ radar, with rare cliff-nesting species such as choughs, a member of the crow family with glossy blue-black plumage and a long, curved, blood-red bill.

Purple Emperor butterflies, clustered bellflowers and sacred rivers: these have been the captivating world of naturalist, conservationist and author Matthew Oates, who has worked as the National Trust’s Specialist on Nature for 27 yearsIn midsummer, on bright, sunny days, parts of the Orme swarm with tiny blue butterflies — the local race of the silver-studded blue. You won’t see a butterfly in greater profusion anywhere in the British Isles.The limestone crags, where sure-footed feral goats hang out, also support a unique, dwarf race of the grayling butterfly. The grey rock dominates, and in dry summers the grasslands also turn grey, making the place feel almost Mediterranean. In June, the short grassland is yellow with birdsfoot trefoil and rockrose flowers, while in high summer the aptly named bloody cranesbill appears on many of the slopes.Compton Bay, Isle of WightHeaven and Earth meet here.

Osborne denies these accusations.The Russian has featured prominently in US prosecutor Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation over his ties to former chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort.He has also been accused of illegal wiretapping, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and death threats against business rivals.Shares in his energy company EN+ dropped 19 per cent on the London Stock Exchange after the sanctions were announced, wiping £1billion from its market value.

It says exports to the United States account for over 10 per cent of its output.Rusal owns assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea.According to a Rusal prospectus, its major customers include Glencore, Toyota, and Rio Tinto Alcan.In his life and career, Deripaska has frequently intersected with the Kremlin and Russian officialdom. He holds regular meetings with President Vladimir Putin, he invested heavily in building infrastructure for Russia\u0027s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are inisible from the state\u0027s interests.The mother of Deripaska\u0027s children, Polina, is the daughter of Valentin Yumashev, who was presidential chief of staff under former Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Yumashev later married Yeltsin\u0027s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.           Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort (pictured), who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump          \u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on TuesdayYeltsin and his entourage were instrumental in elevating Vladimir Putin to power as the anointed successor to the ailing president.Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort, who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump when he was running for president.Last year the Washington Post reported that Manafort sent an email in July 2016 offering Deripaska private briefings about Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign. Manafort was chairman of the campaign at the time.Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni has said the email exchanges were \u0027innocuous\u0027 and aimed at collecting money owed by past clients.   Raising the stakes: Senior Trump officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort by the U.S. to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin\u0027s government and his inner circle  Industry bigs: Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate whose Rusal is one of the country\u0027s biggest companies and who has ties to ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort is being hit, as is Gazprom CEO Alexi MillerThis latest wave of sanctions come as senior U.S. administration officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort to push back at  Putin and his inner circle. But Trump has continued to avoid directly criticizing Putin himself, and recently invited the Russian leader to meet with him, possibly at the White House.Still, in recent weeks Trump\u0027s administration has rolled out a series of actions - including several economic and diplomatic steps - to increase pressure on Putin and those in his circle.\u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday.Rather than punishing Russia for one specific action, the new sanctions are in response to \u0027the totality of the Russian government\u0027s ongoing and increasingly brazen pattern\u0027 of bad behavior, said the officials, who weren\u0027t authorized to comment by name and briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.It was not clear whether any of those hit have significant, or any, holdings that would be covered and most of them were warned of possible penalties in January when they were identified as possible targets on lists published by the Treasury and State departments.   Pout of order: Kiril Shamalov, who is believed to be married to Putin\u0027s daughter Katerina Tikhonova, is one of those facing new sanctions  Friends and allies: Igor Rotenberg\u0027s father is one of Putin\u0027s oldest friends while Andrey Kostin heads Russia\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the stateThe administration officials said Americans who may currently have business with them would be given guidance about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The officials ticked through a list of activities they said had prompted the U.S. to act, including Russia\u0027s annexation of Crimea, backing separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, cyber-hacking and attempts to subvert Western democracy.Many of the targets are iniduals and businesses associated with Russia\u0027s energy sector, including those affiliated with state-owned Gazprom. Officials said the goal was to show that those who have benefited financially from Putin\u0027s position of power are fair game for U.S. punishments, noting that many of those being sanctioned are closely tied to Putin himself.Targets include:Kirill Shamalov, who is reportedly Putin\u0027s son-in-law, married to his daughter Katerina Tikhonova, although neither Putin nor the Kremlin have acknowledged that she is his daughter.Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg, a friend of Putin\u0027s since they were teenagers.Andrey Kostin, named among government officials, heads the nation\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the state.Alexei Miller, the longtime head of the state-controlled Gazprom natural gas giant. Both Miller and Kostin are longtime key members of Putin\u0027s team.          Victim: Sergei Skripal, a Russian who spied for Britain, was poisoned with a nerve agent prompting tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats. His daughter Yulia (left) was also left seriously illOther oligarchs on the list include some top names on the Forbes\u0027 list of billionaires, aren\u0027t part of Putin\u0027s inner circle but like any other billionaire tycoons in Russia they vie for the Kremlin\u0027s attention to preserve and extend their business empires.Many of the Russian oligarchs and politicians and affiliated businesses had already been identified by the Treasury and State Department as potential targets on a list that was compiled and published in January.One of those hit by Friday\u0027s sanctions, Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the Russian Federation Council\u0027s foreign affairs committee, expressed surprise he had not already been blacklisted by the U.S.\u0027As far as I am concerned the only thing I\u0027m surprised at is that this didn\u0027t happen earlier,\u0027 he told the Interfax news agency. \u0027I never made secret of my criticism of the U.S. foreign policy, and I will not change my stance.\u0027The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.           On their way home: Russian diplomats kicked out of the U.S. were picked up by government bus in Moscow on Sunday, while later in the week American embassy staff flew back to the U.S.But the administration said it would give guidance to Americans who may currently have business with them about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The Trump administration used a variety of legal mechanisms to implement the sanctions, including the Countering America\u0027s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.Known as CAATSA, the law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 2017 and signed by President Donald Trump despite some objections. The law aims to punish Russia for interfering in the U.S. election as well as actions intended to subvert democracy in Europe. The law also authorizes the president to impose sanctions on Iran for destabilizing activity in the Middle East and North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Last month, the U.S. targeted 19 Russians and five other entities with sanctions in the first use of the law. The administration has also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian consulates in response to Russian behavior, including the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that has been blamed on Moscow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86a05293637642a8108368f8ba8cdc20ce47d9e1/0_0_5536_3654/master/5536.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1095ab66ddb45c121e0ea2d35247f339 1400w","title":"from burning cars to barren blocks 20 years chasing the great american dream in pictures","story":"Mike O’Meally moved to the US in 1998 intending to photograph skateboarders but became fascinated by the idea of the great America dream – especially after the events of 911.

But why does the stereotype persist?During the 2016 US presidential election, American social media was flooded with images of Hillary Clinton wearing a black hat and riding a broom, or else cackling with green skin. Her opponents named her The Wicked Witch of the Left, claimed they had sources testifying that she smelled of sulphur, and took particular delight in depictions of her being melted. Given that the last witch trial in the US was more than 100 hundred years ago, what are we to make of this?In the late 19th century, the suffragette Matilda Joslyn Gage asserted something revolutionary. The persecution of witches, she said, had nothing to do with fighting evil or resisting the devil. It was simply entrenched social misogyny, the goal of which was to repress the intellect of women. A witch, she said, wasn’t wicked. She didn’t fly on a broomstick naked in the dark, or consort with demons. She was, instead, likely to be a woman “of superior knowledge”. As a thought experiment, she suggested that for “witches” we should read instead “women”. Their histories, she intimated, run hand in hand.Obviously, she was on to something. When we say witch, we almost exclusively mean woman. Sure, men have also been accused of witchcraft, but they are by far the minority. Further, the words used to describe men with magical powers – warlock, magus, sorcerer, wizard – don’t carry the same stigma.A better parallel to “witch” is the word “whore”. Both are time-honoured tools for policing women, meant to shame them into socially prescribed behaviour. A whore transgresses norms of female sexuality a witch transgresses norms of female power. Witches are often called unnatural because of their ability to threaten men. With her spells, a witch can transform you into a pig, or defeat you in battle. She can curse you, blight your crops, ignore you, refuse you, correct you. Punishing witches accomplishes two things: it ends the threat and makes others afraid to follow in the unruly woman’s footsteps.Yet, despite all the attempts to stamp out witches, they are as strongly with us as ever, from Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch in the Avengers movies, to the recent film The Love Witch, to the television series American Horror Story, to non-fiction books such as Stacy Schiff’s The Witches: Salem, 1692. The stereotypical image of the witch – green skin, pointed hat, warts, black cat – has become entrenched, but beneath that surface lies a dazzling variety a rich ersity of women who have frightened, possessed and inspired us over the centuries.Let’s start with the classic: the evil, aged crone. This image took firm root in the Christian era, when witches were women who consorted with the devil but old and ugly witches predated Jesus. Roman literature portrayed witches as pathetic creatures with false teeth and grey hair, who dug in the ground by moonlight, tore animals with their teeth and used the organs of boys they starved to death for their spells. They had two main pastimes: making love potions, and casting curses. The poet Ovid blamed a disappointing sexual performance on a witch using a sort of Roman voodoo doll to take away his potency. (Sure Ovid, that was my first thought, too.)The most famous of this type must be Shakespeare’s weird sisters from Macbeth. They are repulsive “midnight hags”, with skinny lips, chapped fingers and beards. Their spells – eye of newt and toe of frog – are as disgusting as their appearances and curse anyone who crosses them. The classic fairytale witch, like the one in the story of Hansel and Gretel who eats children, also fits into this category, as does the Slavic Baba Yaga, and the Wicked Witch of the West from L Frank Baum’s Oz series, made famous by actor Margaret Hamilton. The role was originally offered to the glamorous Gale Sondergaard, but she turned it down because she didn’t want to appear ugly.And ugliness, of course, is key. The haggish outsides of these witches are meant to match their evil insides, and testify to their unnaturalness, since women are supposed to be as neat, attractive and young as possible. But the association with age also contains a kernel of truth: many of the women accused of witchcraft were so-called “wise women”, older figures, often poor widows, who scratched out a living in the community with their experience as midwives, herbalists and hedge-doctors. Their solitary, vulnerable status and unusual knowledge made them perfect targets for people’s rage and fear when crops failed or babies died.Foreign women were also vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft, and the association between immigrants and sorcery goes back at least to Greek mythology. The witch Medea was the princess of Colchis, on the eastern edge of the Black Sea, which to the notoriously xenophobic ancient Greeks was alien and suspect. When Jason and his Argonauts came to claim the Golden Fleece from her father, Medea fell in love with Jason and aided him with her spells, so that he and the Argonauts were able to seize the fleece and escape. In gratitude, Jason married Medea, but back home in his kingdom she was shunned, her witchcraft and foreignness merging into a single undesirable trait. The idea seems to have been: no wonder she’s a murderous sorceress, she’s from the east.Fears of witchcraft grounded in racism persist even today. The Roma, longtime outcasts in Europe, have frequently been accused of evil magic. And African-influenced voodoo is routinely used by Hollywood as a horror movie plot point.But it wasn’t just vulnerable women who drew accusations of witchcraft. It was also women with serious political power. Joan of Arc led the French to victory against the English and was renowned in France for her purity, cleverness and faith in her “voices”. When the English leadership couldn’t beat her, they undermined her, crediting her success to demonic means, since, of course, a young woman could never perform such wonders on her own. When she was captured, they tried her for witchcraft, citing as partial proof of her unnaturalness the tremendous bravery she showed in battle, and her ability to outwit her examiners in debate.Cleopatra and Anne Boleyn were likewise accused of witchcraft, with rumours that Anne even bore physical marks of her compact with the devil, such as a third nipple, moles and a sixth finger on her right hand. Such accusations were a clever and effective way for a woman’s political enemies to smear her since, as countless other women accused of witchcraft learned, it is impossible to offer definitive proof that one is not a witch. Perhaps what is most shocking about this catch-22 is the way in which it continues to be played out today. Aside from Hillary Clinton, who has been called a witch since she was first lady, there was also the case of Julia Gillard, first female prime minister of Australia, who met with taunts of “ditch the witch” from protesters. Nancy Pelosi, the minority speaker of the US House of Representatives, has faced similar witch-related insults, and recently Theresa May was filmed laughing loudly, and her so-called “witch’s cackle” quickly went viral. The misogyny of all this is obvious. Debating and defeating these leaders politically isn’t enough – as women who show ambition, they are abominations who must be deemed evil and cast out.The tradition of the sexy witch, who lures men with her beauty, is beloved by modern-day adult costume-makers, but goes all the way back to the first witch in western literature: the ine sorceress Circe. She first appears in Homer’s Odyssey, after Odysseus and his crew have washed up on her island, exhausted and grieving for the loss of their comrades. They go searching for inhabitants and find a palatial house with tame lions and wolves lolling around in the garden. A shining goddess comes to the door, and invites them in. She gives them food and wine which she has drugged with spell-herbs, then lifts her wand and turns them into pigs.Circe’s story brings together many classic witchy motifs: a skill with herbs and potions, a magic wand, control over animals. But what is most notable is her moral ambiguity – though she begins the episode as a figure of menace, after she and Odysseus become lovers, she transforms his men back and offers vital resources and advice to Odysseus for his journey home. Not all seductive witches show a similar ambiguity (CS Lewis’s White Witch certainly does not), but Morgan le Fay, Morticia Addams and Melisandre from Game of Thrones all fall into this category.This brings us to our last type: the good witch. Before we get to the famous examples, let’s start with the unknown ones – the countless women of history who used their knowledge of herbs, healing and midwifery to serve their communities as de facto doctors and chemists. In times when reliable medical treatment was scarce and expensive, they offered the first, and often only, help a suffering person would receive. Matilda Joslyn Gage, in her treatise Woman, Church and State, hailed this local herb-woman as “the profoundest thinker, the most advanced scientist” of her age. Gage’s name is largely unknown now, but her work lives vibrantly on: she was the mother-in-law of Baum, and directly influenced his creation of Glinda, one of the most iconic good witches in popular culture. Glinda is a sparkly, memorable presence in the 1939 movie, and plays a meaty role in the books, protecting the good people of Oz with passion and wisdom. We may likewise see Gage’s spirit in Gregory Maguire’s novel Wicked, which reimagines the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, as a heroic, misunderstood character.Of course no discussion of good witches can be complete without the superlative Hermione Granger. Throughout JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series, Hermione’s intellect, kindness, sense of justice and determination make her a role model for young girls – and boys – everywhere. And she’s only one of dozens of fascinating witches Rowling created, who run the gamut from good (Minerva McGonagall) to cruelly wicked (Bellatrix Lestrange).Which brings us back to the multiplicity and ersity of witches. The truth is that witches cannot really be contained by types they leap over boundaries, bursting out of categories as fast we make them. They are constantly changing as we change, reflecting our ideas about women back to ourselves.If this is so, then there is much to feel encouraged by. The image of the good witch is ascendant in popular culture (aside from Hermione, as exemplified by the Scarlet Witch, Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the new A Wrinkle in Time movie, prominently featuring Mrs Which, Mrs Who and Mrs Whatsit). Women have made powerful strides towards equality, and we are seeing an unprecedented awareness of sexual harassment, assault and the silencing of women. More of these secret abuses are coming to light every day, and more of the perpetrators are being removed from power.We stand therefore at a crossroads – which is fitting, since crossroads are sacred to Hecate, Greek goddess of witchcraft. Will we continue to fear and punish women with power? To call them evil? Or perhaps we can at last celebrate female strength, recognising that witches – and women – are not going away •• Circe by Madeline Miller is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

Do you love me?” Rose Tremain’s mother kept asking her daughter at the end of her life. “And I’d say: ‘Yes, of course I do.’ But I never have and I never will because you didn’t show me love when I needed it,” the novelist says now, as if her mother, Jane, were in the room with us.After more than 40 years of not drawing on her own life in her fiction, Tremain has written a memoir. This slim, elegant – sometimes shocking – study of maternal failure is also a love letter to her nanny, “the kindest person I’ve ever known”, the author’s “saviour” and “angel”. Her childhood, she writes in Rosie: Scenes from a Vanished Life, was defined by one heartbreaking wish: “I didn’t want Jane to be my mother I wanted Nan to be my mother.” The scenes of the title are moments of “particular emotional intensity”, Tremain explains, usually episodes of “dereliction or cruelty” on the part of her parents – in particular, her mother. “She really didn’t like us, either me or my sister. And I don’t quite know why.”Materially, their postwar, upper-middle-class upbringing “was quite privileged and easy”, she says. “And in an emotional way really hard.” This was a world in which the pre-lunch gin and tonics flowed more freely than affection, and children were expected to be seldom seen, at least not by their parents. In her memory, their house in Chelsea, “a pleasant but ordinary little London borough then”, is ided between the “frozen world” of her parents on the lower floors, and at the top of the house “this very warm, loving heart with Nan,” with whom she shared a bedroom for her first 10 years. Her father, Keith Thomson, unerringly referred to as a “failed playwright” (“He wasn’t very good”, she says) wrote in an office on a little landing: “Shhh, daddy’s working …” they were told every time they went up the stairs.When she was 10, he walked out on the family for a younger woman, rupturing her childhood into a before and after “the great casting away”. Her mother had a breakdown and promptly married one of their circle (“the grown ups were playing musical beds”) Rosie and Jo were sent to boarding school (an exile of chilblains and constant hunger) and worst of all – Nan was sent away.A natural storyteller, Tremain talks in eloquent anecdotes with the precise intonation of a distinguished actor – and flashes of gossipy humour. Rare is the interview that doesn’t mention her Georgian house on the outskirts of Norwich. And yes, early spring sunshine fills the lovely sitting room, where tall windows give a view on to sloping lawns and wide Norfolk skies. “When I first saw this house,” she recalls, “I’d come out of a very unhappy orce, all very frantic. I remember walking into this room and the elderly couple who were here were eating cucumber sandwiches and watching the Test match. I thought – this is something else, I think I have to buy this.”That was in 1985, and for the last couple of decades she has shared it with the biographer Richard Holmes. “Richard is sort of a perfect partner for me. We have such a wonderful ongoing conversation. It’s very rare that you meet a soulmate, isn’t it? But we are,” she says matter-of-factly. As her first two marriages were “turbulent”, it was not until her mid-40s, she says, that her life became “sensible and stable”: one of the reasons why Rosie ends on the brink of adulthood. “I don’t want to write the sort of memoir that slags people off and takes vengeance,” she says firmly. “I don’t admire writers who do that. It’s cheap, angry. I’m not, I hope, cheap or angry.”She had hoped the book might help her both understand and forgive her parents – it didn’t. A sorry incident (borrowed in her 2010 novel, Trespass) when her mother got stuck in a lime-green bathing costume on her 13th birthday has ruined the day ever since, “hard on the people who have to share it with me now”. But by sheer “force of mind” she long ago resolved to stop being persecuted by feelings of loss about her absent father. “It’s over. Finished,” she decided. She couldn’t have written the memoir had her parents, especially her mother, still been alive: “It would have been too hurtful to her.”The book arose out of a conversation with her daughter, Eleanor, a psychotherapist, during one of their weekly lunches. “She said to me: ‘Come on Mum, I want to know about Nan,’ ” Tremain recalls. “It was an absolutely overwhelming experience. And of course, being a therapist, Eleanor could facilitate the conversation very well. I don’t know what they thought in the restaurant, me sort of weeping.”It was Nan’s affection that saved her sanity and stopped her passing on the mistakes of her mother, “who had no schooling in love”, to Eleanor and ultimately to her two young grandchildren. (Although she is the least autobiographical of authors, Tremain’s emotionally inadequate mothers – in, for example, The Gustav Sonata, and Sacred Country – now seem striking.) After the lunch, Tremain came home and started looking through old photograph albums. “I thought, I do have very strong feelings about all this. I’ll probably die quite soon and it will be lost.” So she started writing.One of the most memorable scenes records a “little epiphany” she experienced at school when she was around 13 or 14, the intensity felt as she describes it all these years later: “We had been playing tennis, it was summer, early evening, a very beautiful light. I remember standing in this hay meadow, it had just been cut, so there was that absolutely wonderful scent of new-mown hay, and thinking, this is going to go in about five minutes, how can I can capture this? This feeling of almost transcendence? The beauty of this place?” So she wrote a story about it, “locking it in ... for ever”. She can’t remember whether the story was any good. “I don’t suppose it was,” she says. But it confirmed in her the certainty that “writing was the only thing that I wanted to do”.Nan died in 1964 when Tremain was at university, and it is one of her sadnesses that she never knew of her literary success, especially as she would have taken more pride in it than either of her parents.Her early novels were critically well received, but it wasn’t until her fifth, Restoration – “a ludicrously flamboyant, noisy, wild, sort of orchestral thing”, she says now – that she really made her name. (It is the only one of her books her father, jealous of her success, admitted to enjoying.) Set in the court of Charles II, “a mirror” to the explosion of Thatcherite materialism at the time, it also earned her the label “historical novelist”, which, she says, has followed her around ever since.In fact, several of her novels now seem prescient in their timeliness, tackling issues such as transsexuality in Sacred Country (1992), and immigration in The Road Home, which won the Orange prize in 2008 and which, post-Brexit, she’s updating for TV. Sacred Country was described as “groundbreaking” by Peter Tatchell in a new introduction for its reissue last year, but when it first came out, “People said: ‘What? This is such a marginalised subject. Why’s she writing about this?’” she says.Long part of the literary establishment, Tremain was one of only six women on the inaugural 1983 Granta best young British novelists list that included Amis, Barnes, McEwan, Ishiguro et al. It’s hard to think of a contemporary novelist to rival her imaginative range: her fiction roams the world from 17th‑century Denmark to 21st-century London. But, although Restoration was shortlisted for the Booker in 1989 (losing out to Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day), the prize has eluded her, perhaps, it has been suggested, due to a sniffiness about historical fiction. Then Hilary Mantel marched into the 16th century and made off with the trophy – twice. “Yes, it’s quite annoying isn’t it,” Tremain laughs.Does the Booker still bother her? “Well, it does slightly,” she says with unwriterly candour. “I think, really? All those books which have had on the whole, such great acclaim, why has that never happened? But it annoys me that it bothers me. And now we’ve got the Americans in it, it’s gone, hasn’t it?” She has been a judge twice, in 1988 and 2000. Did she enjoy it? The first time, yes the second, not so much.Her office is lined with box-files of cuttings: she likes a Kipling image – “riddling the fire of your research” – to describe her writing process. Holmes works upstairs. They meet for lunch. Lots of coffee. And clock off around 6.30pm. “Sometimes a bit scratchy, sometimes a bit silent.” One of the great things about living with another writer, she says, is not having to explain “the mood of slight preoccupation. It’s a great relief. Because if you are doing creative work you are bound to have bad times with it, aren’t you?” Both she and Holmes are determined “to keep working until we fall over or our minds go completely, what he calls ‘the boots-on strategy’.”She hit a crisis last April, after the death of her editor Penny Hoare, with whom she had worked since her first book, Sadler’s Birthday, in 1976. Penny would come to stay and they would go through each manuscript line by line. “She would sit there,” Tremain says pointing at a chair next to her – “very upright. She would only want roast chicken for dinner. We would talk for two days.” Her longest book, Music and Silence, “took us three days. I think we ran out of chicken.” Penny had Rosie by her bed when she died, Tremain says, her voice catching. “She would just unerringly put her hands on all the weak points of the book, quite uncanny to me.”For the first time, Tremain doubted whether she would be able to carry on, but somehow her joy in writing still hasn’t wavered. She cites Amis’s observation that if he were not a writer life would be “thin”. But she’s not very hopeful about the world at large: “I can hardly watch the news,” she admits. “With war and climate change and Brexit and Trump – it’s never been worse in my 70-odd years of life. I think we live in really very terrifying times.”Outside of her study, she finds solace in the cafe in Norwich’s John Lewis. “A cheese scone and a cup of coffee and I’m completely at peace,” she says. “Give me a tearoom anywhere. So many things that we do in our life you have to do. Pretty much must do, must do, must do. But you can just decide to be in your tearoom, or not. They are spaces outside time.”And the novel she is working on now?Well, it begins in a teashop – and ends in the jungle of Borneo.“If I can keep on writing fiction, that’s a tiny contribution to people’s mental health,” she says. “You can pick up one of my books and think: ‘Oh well, for the next half an hour, I’m all right.’” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d35cceb0a400420be0a1881b521c322df19193/0_282_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=58f9c6abfcf34fea33c60c9997951993 1240w","title":"bestway jobs deal bargain booze owner conviviality","story":"Wine Rack and Bargain Booze rescued from brink by wholesaler in £7m dealAbout 2,000 jobs are set to be saved with the buyout of retail chains Wine Rack and Bargain Booze in a £7m deal.The retail ision of troubled drinks group Conviviality has been acquired by grocery wholesaler Bestway in a pre-pack administration process, which allows the buyer to cherry pick a collapsed company’s best assets at a bargain price.The deal was completed just before midnight on Friday.Matthew Callaghan, partner at PwC, said: “This deal safeguards the jobs of more than 2,000 employees, ensures franchisees have the ability to continue to trade and creates some much-needed stability for business customers and the sector in general. “Alongside the sale of Conviviality’s Direct business earlier this week, the total number of staff whose jobs have been protected stands at more than 4,000.”Bestway, which was founded and is chaired by the billionaire Sir Anwar Pervez, is one of Britain’s biggest food wholesalers serving thousands of retailers it also owns the Well pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014.Conviviality announced its intention to appoint administrators last week after a string of profit warnings and the discovery of a £30m tax bill, putting more than 2,600 jobs at risk.On Wednesday, Magners owner C\u0026ampC bought Conviviality’s wholesale arm through a pre-pack administration. The Irish cider giant bought wholesalers Matthew Clark, Bibendum, Catalyst, Peppermint, Elastic and Walker \u0026amp Wodehouse for a nominal sum. Stella Artois and Budweiser maker AB InBev is also supporting the deal. PwC handled the sale and administration process.Conviviality’s retail arm operates more than 800 stores under brands including chains Select Convenience, Central Convenience and Wine Rack as well as Bargain Booze, many of which are run by independent franchisees.The breakup of Conviviality marks the end of the firm after rapid demise over just a few weeks. The company blamed the first shock profit warning on a spreadsheet arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins and then admitted it had not budgeted for the £30m tax bill due at the end of March.Conviviality issued a third profit warning as it admitted it needed to ask investors for new funding of £125m to avoid going bust, but failed to convince them of its long-term future. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit after raising questions over the company’s strategy in making a string of rapid acquisitions, including the recent purchase of more than 100 Central Convenience stores from the collapsed Palmer \u0026amp Harvey business.Meanwhile, the chair of parliament’s work and pensions committee, Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f418d1af33e22942422b00d707fa39e63a471f15/0_2458_5191_3114/master/5191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39bb8abb03b06700c946d5e8cabd0a57 1240w","title":"east end small business artist relocate eailway arch rent rise","story":"Spiralling rents are driving growing numbers of artists and small businesses out of London’s East End, with the problem expected to spread to other cities around the UK.In many cases, traders are being replaced by cafes and workspaces designed for people working on laptops.Of those that remain, many are struggling for survival, as business rates also went up substantially last year for the first time in seven years.Frances Northrop of the New Economics Foundation says: “Imagine London without the small businesses of Portobello Road, Brick Lane, Columbia Road and Chinatown. They are being driven out by the cold logic of ever-increasing rents.”Many small independent businesses are based in railway arches across London, often owned by Network Rail or Transport for London.Network Rail has almost 4,500 arches across the country, with two-thirds of those in London. Transport for London, meanwhile, owns about 2,000 commercial units across London.Derec Hickman of Chu’s Garage in Hackney, who runs the Guardians of the Arches, a group that is open to traders in the rest of the UK, says: “The action is spreading from London to other cities. What’s happening to us will happen to them.”Five of his neighbours are looking to leave, and one trader has already moved out of the arches due to the crippling rent increases.The EETG is proposing a London working rent: an affordable formula for small and micro-businesses akin to the London living rent, and has received backing from the mayors of Hackney and Tower Hamlets.The New Economics Foundation is in the process of working out a formula. Guardian Money spoke to a number of small businesses affected by the rent hikes.The bespoke furniture maker was one of the first tenants at Bayford Street Industrial Units in Hackney, built by the Greater London Council in the 1980s to attract local business and jobs to a then-run down area.This year, unable to meet the now private landlord’s demands to double the rent, Poetstyle, with its 15 furniture makers, moved to Hainault, on the border of London and Essex. Managing director Charlie Fox says it has just moved out of its second workshop in a railway arch in Hackney after facing a similar rent hike there.He says Network Rail originally asked for £31 per sq ft, which was then reduced to £18 until September, but going up to £24 thereafter. He was originally paying £14.“It’s not really viable,” he says. “It is tough, ever since Brexit, but I just can’t hike the price of a sofa because I’m up against cheap imports.”Sarah Haque and her son launched their company in 2004 in Cheshire Street, Shoreditch, to create and sell T-shirts and other products designed by London and UK-based artists.Their business rate has gone up from £1,100 to £16,000 a year, while the annual rent charged by their private landlord is rising to £29,000 plus VAT in a stepped five-year increase, compared with £8,500 in 2006. No improvements have been made to the space, she says.Haque says she had to reduce her staff from 10 to four. “It’s very, very sad because we’ve been here more than 10 years and it’ll be sad to leave. We can’t increase our business, we are late in paying the rent and late in paying salaries. It’s just a mess.”Best known for its laser-cut Perspex jewellery, Tatty Devine is run by Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, who founded the business together in 1999, and were awarded MBEs for services to the fashion industry in 2013.They opened a shop in London’s Brick Lane in 2000 – but Wolfenden says the shop rent has quadrupled since then.“It’s getting to the point where it’s unaffordable,” she says. “It’s driving out so many creatives from Hackney or Tower Hamlets. A lot have gone to Kent, to Margate.”She notes that there are lot of empty shops in east London.Wolfenden adds: “If we were to inflate our prices to match the rent and rate rises, we would go out of business.”She says the business is surviving because it includes retail, wholesale and e-commerce, and could not have been set up in the same location if she and Vine were starting it today.The MOT garage in a railway arch in London Fields, east London, was founded by Quang Chu 30 years ago.He is battling a rent increase from Network Rail, his landlord, which originally wanted to hike the rent from £18,000 to £38,000 (or £35,000 if the garage gave up its secured tenancy).Network Rail is now asking for a stepped increase to £26,500 in the first year, going up to £34,000 in the third year, says the firm.Ten other traders in the arches were put under the same pressure, says Derec Hickman, who married into the Vietnamese family that founded Chu’s Garage.The garage and one other trader are due to go to arbitration, where the rent will be set by independent assessors.What the owners sayOn the claim that it is hiking rents in order to pocket a bigger profit from the sale of property, it says “this is completely untrue. Any reviews are part of business-as-usual activity. The sale will be based on past performance and receipts of the estate over a number of years”.Transport for LondonGraeme Craig, director of commercial development, says: “We are committed to encouraging erse, small businesses as vital to London’s economy. Our leases are flexible … and we are working with Tower Hamlets and Hackney and the EETG to explore how we might change our policies to allow smaller businesses to continue to flourish on our estate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80f25e360f51a2c5b05cb2f08853ae42c1744d5/0_98_4614_2769/master/4614.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4dcb7daab55952ef35113ef36a5dcaa4 1240w","title":"fresh blow for airbus as boeing wins 12bn jet order from american airlines","story":"The deal for wide-bodied aircraft is the latest in a series of setbacks for the European manufacturer’s A330neo aircraftBoeing has won a crucial contest to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines, beating European rival Airbus for the highly coveted order of wide-body, long-haul aircraft.“This was a difficult decision between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 and A330neo and we thank both manufacturers for their aggressive efforts to earn more of American’s business.

It comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines dropped an order for six of the jets in favor of the 787, leaving that variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers. “This new order is a powerful endorsement of the 787 family’s unique passenger appeal and unmatched ability to help airlines open new routes and grow profitably,” Boeing chief executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement. Reuters had previously reported that Boeing was primed to emerge triumphant in the hard-fought widebody contest, bringing along in its victory engine maker General Electric, whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft.

In Brisbane a cheeky radio interviewer asks Prince Charles if he really does carry a personal lavatory seat on his travels, and the prince replies, “Oh, don’t believe all that crap.” Elsewhere in the Queensland capital, India win gold in the women’s weightlifting and lose to Cameroon in the men’s basketball. At Buckingham Palace, a menu is drawn up for a banquet to be attended later this month by 53 heads of state or their representatives. In Whitehall, the Department for International Trade ponders the effects on British farming of hormone-treated beef imports from Australia, which is a probable consequence of the UK’s first post-Brexit trade deal.In one way or another, the Commonwealth is responsible for all these things: for the Commonwealth Games, which demand the presence of the heir to the throne in Australia for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm), the 25th such conclave since 1971, which occurs in London (and Windsor Castle) on 16-20 April and, simply by its dogged and unlikely persistence as an international grouping, for permitting the British delusion that old imperial patterns of trade can replace the present arrangements with the EU. (Enter the hormone-treated beef.)Not that the Commonwealth itself encouraged this idea: nearly every Commonwealth republic and “realm” wanted the UK to remain inside the EU. And not that Europhobes have always prized the Commonwealth. As our present foreign secretary wrote in 2002, “It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies.” The Commonwealth that some Brexit campaigners had in mind was perhaps a little whiter – taking the definition of Commonwealth all the way back to the time when it meant the British empire’s settler dominions: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Newfoundland and South Africa, which were sovereign states, not colonies, and bound only by their loyalty to the crown.Indian independence forced Britain to be more flexible about who could be included. As India would be a republic, loyal oaths were out of the question. But Britain was keen to maintain some form of the old connection “in the mistaken belief”, according to the Commonwealth historian Philip Murphy, “that India’s huge standing army would continue to underwrite British great-power status”. There were other reasons too. Historic sentiment, fear of American ambition, the need to protect British markets: together they led Britain to propose a compromise. All that would be required was that India recognise the king as the head of the Commonwealth, “as the symbol of the free association of its independent member states”, rather than pledging loyalty to him. Even so, the offer still flew in the face of the complete withdrawal that had been promised by leaders of the independence movement. But India’s prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, finally went along with it – realising, he said, that Commonwealth membership meant “independence plus, not independence minus”.Other countries felt the same. In his forthcoming book, The Empire’s New Clothes: the Myth of the Commonwealth, Murphy argues that Britain didn’t mastermind the growth of the modern Commonwealth as part of a grand geopolitical strategy. Newly independent colonies wanted to belong, not least because their anticolonial leaders still felt a strong sense of cultural attachment to Britain and the British institutions – universities mainly – that had brought them into contact with contemporaries from other parts of the world.Any thought that the Commonwealth could successfully perpetuate the empire vanished with the Suez humiliation in 1956, when Nehru and India sided with Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt over the Anglo-French assault. The ties to London began to weaken. Names changed to reflect different realities. Founded in 1930, the British Empire Games became the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954, the British Commonwealth Games in 1970, and finally the Commonwealth Games in 1978.The theme of this month’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting is “Towards a Common Future”. The host runs the risk of turning into the most\u0026nbspunpopular guest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d959b82caac7655e6820bcf09c4b67ebcb74828a/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e89059239371b5b4a5e9b7cbff062cbc 1240w","title":"charlie kirk turning point usa universities free speech debate","story":"With universities in an ‘existential crisis’, Turning Point USA sells a safe space for conservatives who have convinced themselves they are the embattled minorityAnyone who regularly reads a US newspaper knows that universities in this country are in an existential crisis. No, not because of decades of underfunding, or the partly related ballooning university administrations, but because of “postmodernism” and “safe spaces”. It is one of the few things conservatives and liberals agree on these days. The dominance of “fake courses” and “political correctness” is a major theme in conservative media, from Fox News to the Wall Street Journal, as well as liberal media like the New York Times and, yes, even the Guardian.Almost all accounts of alleged censorship of “conservative voices” are based on events at private universities, mostly Ivy League schools in the north-east, as well as some “public Ivies”, notably the University of California at Berkeley. But how bad is the situation in the “real America”, ie that vast space between the coasts that is sometimes, derogatively, referred to as “the flyover states”?To find out, I attended an event at my own university, the University of Georgia (UGA), a public university in a deep-red state. Like most of the universities I have taught at in the US, UGA has a fairly apolitical campus, where only a few usual suspects organize small events around issues like LBTQ rights and the occupation of Palestine. Most students come from Republican homes, holding fairly conservative views without necessarily realizing it. For example, Reagan’s statement that “government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem”, revolutionary in 1981, is considered apolitical common sense by many of my students.As I approach the building where the event is held, I see a surprisingly large university police presence. I count at least six UGAPD officers, of which three would also be in the lecture hall during the whole event. This excessive police presence reinforces the impression that “conservatives” are embattled on campus, even though I am not aware of any physical attack on or credible threat to rightwing organizations or students at UGA in the past years. The few protesters, including the inevitable Democratic Socialists of America, seem resigned to being an irrelevant side note to the event.After signing in and picking up some free goodies from the well-stacked TPUSA table – such as “BDS  BS” and “Socialism Sucks!” buttons and stickers – I go into the large lecture hall, which will soon be almost filled. Some 250 students attend the event, which is a large turnout for a midweek political event at UGA. I guesstimate that some 50 students were protesters, 50 were curious attendees and 150 were true sympathizers – although the number of Make America Great Again hats and Stars and Stripes clothing was disappointingly low.After a quick, and nervous, introduction by the local chapter president, Kirk took the stage to enthusiastic applause. At first sight, Kirk is an unlikely hero of rightwing students. He did not attend college and believes fewer people should go to college. On the other hand, that is also part of his appeal among conservatives: the self-made man, untainted by progressive universities, who knows things because the truth doesn’t need a degree.After a quick pandering to the home crowd, saying he supported Georgia against Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship, he starts his attack on the universities. The story is simple, really: universities are full of Marxist professors, who force students to take irrelevant courses, which indoctrinate them with postmodernism and socialism – the fact that these two are diametrically opposed is but a detail. While many students raise their hands when asked whether they have to take “irrelevant courses” for their major, it is unclear whether these are of the Marxist and postmodern persuasion Kirk spoke about.To back his claims up, he states that Karl Marx’s The Communist Manifesto is the most assigned book in college. This is a popular claim among rightwing media, based on outdated results from the highly problematic Open Syllabus Project. A more recent count has the writing guide The Elements of Style as the most assigned text, with The Communist Manifesto coming third, behind Plato’s Republic. Interestingly, Marx did not even make the top 10 among the so maligned Ivy League schools, which do have Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations, a favorite among conservatives and radical right alike, as the second most assigned book!The attack on Marxists in higher education leads to a question by one of the protesters, a self-acclaimed Marxist (“I think”), who exemplifies the lazy left’s response to rightwing challenges on campus. Inarticulate and opinionated rather than informed, he becomes the perfect “leftwing” punching bag for Kirk, who happily gives him excessive time to field questions, shooting back with specific clarifications, which overwhelm the student, and thereby “prove” Kirk’s intellectual and ideological superiority.After that much of the lecture focuses on guns, in which Kirk presents himself as a staunch defender of the NRA and the AR-15. In addition to an excellent one-liner, “there is no first amendment without the second amendment”, he throws out various statistics about guns in the US and abroad, which make him look rational and well-informed, even though many of the statistics are from dodgy studies or are presented out of context. Moreover, Kirk uses an old debating trick: reduce the general discussion to one small specific issue, then argue that the specific issue doesn’t explain the broader issue, and therefore claim that the broader critique is wrong.After the inarticulate Marxist has regained control of the media, the lecture turns into a student version of a Fox News show, and I decide to call it a night. The next morning, when I wake up, I realize why I was so underwhelmed by my night with Kirk (and the inarticulate Marxist).In essence, Kirk is just Fox News for college students: overly confident rhetoric, backed up by at best fudged data, taking down a far left straw man. Moreover, in much of the “real America”, including at their university campuses, Kirk is part of the political mainstream, selling a safe space for white conservatives who have convinced themselves that they are the embattled minority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bec11314e3cb7fc3b97a1e24517e9772617429/0_180_1365_1649/master/1365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2af9d6460b249ee1ddbc7e313848655e 1240w","title":"hadley freeman help im turning into ben affleck","story":"I saw a photo of Ben Affleck at the beach, tattoo of a phoenix on his back, towel positioned to hide his belly in front, and I thought, oh Ben. I feel you, manAs a miserable, disaffected, self-loathing teenager in the 1990s, my celebrity alter ego was Winona Ryder, who made adolescent misery, disaffection and self-loathing look incredibly chic, as opposed to the unwashed and self-destructive mess that it was and is. A\u0026nbspcelebrity alter ego is a famous person who has a hint of qualities you recognise in yourself, but carries them off perhaps a bit more photogenically, and, as adulthood beckoned, I looked around for role models to show me how to do\u0026nbspthe grownup years well. I gravitated towards cool, older women who looked like they could happily spend a weekend on their own and also like they would be the greatest lunch dates ever. There was Nora Ephron, obviously, and Gloria Steinem, still killing it after all these years. There was also a carefully curated selection of actors: Holly Hunter, Allison Janney, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Field. Yes, I’d think, watching them become even more talented, self-confident and beautiful as the years went by. Those are lives I want. This is the path I\u0026nbspam on.And then, one day, I opened a magazine, saw a photograph and realised I had not grown up to be Nora Ephron or Holly Hunter or even modern-day Winona. I had grown up to be Ben Affleck.To describe this as problematic would be like describing a nuclear holocaust as bad weather. I don’t like Ben Affleck. You don’t like Ben Affleck. Just try saying the words, “I’m a huge Ben Affleck fan”: you physically can’t. But, despite not especially liking Ben Affleck, I have somehow seen most of his movies,\u0026nbspincluding Jersey Girl and Gigli, the latter of which was so bad it lasted only\u0026nbspa week in UK cinemas.So I have witnessed the many phases of\u0026nbspAffleck: the Harvey Weinstein years when he churned out three-star movies that his buddy Weinstein bulldozed through the Oscars (Good Will Hunting, Argo) the bewildering Jennifer Lopez years when Affleck gave hope to\u0026nbspevery random schlub that they, too, might one day date a goddess the marital stability years with Jennifer Garner the marital instability years when Affleck may or may not have shagged the nanny the cash-in superhero years. And I never related to any of those phases, although, if I find myself dating J-Lo in a few years’ time, I’ll happily revise that statement. But then I saw a photo of Ben Affleck at the beach, enormous tattoo of a phoenix on his back, towel carefully positioned to\u0026nbsphide his belly in front, and I thought, oh Ben. I feel you, man.I, too, am falling apart. I have a tweaked nerve in my neck – almost certainly from picking up my twins, who apparently felt they hadn’t destroyed my body enough already – which means I am in pretty much constant pain. I’m a little younger than Affleck, but I am old enough that when I go to parties and hear someone quietly mutter, “So I have this great guy…”, this no longer means that they are about to recommend a drug dealer. It means they are going to tell you about their amazing osteopath, their incredible acupuncturist, their fantastic therapist. Like Affleck, I no longer walk around in a swimsuit without sporting a\u0026nbsptowel and, also like Affleck, I have quietly considered getting a tattoo, my way of raging against the dying light of approaching midlife.A midlife crisis, contrary to popular perception, is not the affair, or\u0026nbspthe newly buff body, although that is a symptom. It’s the visible difficulty with which someone accepts their age, and Affleck’s ongoing\u0026nbspmidlife crisis is now my number one obsession. The New Yorker ran an only semi-satirical article about the larger social meaning of Affleck’s “sadness”, prompting Affleck to tweet in response that he’s “doing fine”, and then somewhat undermined that\u0026nbspclaim by retweeting strangers who expressed their love for him. One magazine recently ran a photo story showing how Affleck always wears stained T-shirts, and another ran a story about his bad taste in T-shirts, both signs of a man who is struggling to dress like the 45‑year‑old he is, and, oh boy, do I feel that. What to wear when caught between Topshop and Country Casuals? And at what age does looking a bit of a mess stop being charming and just make you look gross? (Answer: younger than I am now.) Then there was the tattoo, which he\u0026nbspinsisted was for a movie, until it was obvious that it\u0026nbspwasn’t. When asked about the tattoo, his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, clucked condescendingly, “Bless his heart”, while his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, described it more directly as “Awful. His tattoos always have too many colours, they shouldn’t be so colourful. They should be, like, cooler.” The midlife pain, it never ends.Thank you, Ben Affleck. Thank you for being my celebrity alter ego, because you have shown me not how I want to be, but how I\u0026nbspdon’t. You are the canary in the mine for all of us who were born in the 1970s, and you have shown that the way does not lie in dressing how your dad did\u0026nbspin the 1980s, nor in dressing how you did in your 20s.\u0026nbspMost of all, it\u0026nbspdoes not lie in tattoos. To be honest, I’m not sure what it lies in, but we’ll find it together, Ben, you and me, one towel-clad step at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5db986580c3c26867fc433eee033261e20495e/0_104_3537_2122/master/3537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d33d37badc7a0f2c56c501aaf839d700 1240w","title":"peter kay hailed as comedy genius over car share finale","story":"Comedian holds special screenings after more than 100,000 fans demand a conclusion to seriesFans of Peter Kay have hailed him as a “comedy genius” after a special public screening of the final episodes of his sitcom Car Share.Kay recently announced there would be three charity screenings of his popular BBC comedy show at the Blackpool Opera House, each one airing a special finale to the series, as well as an entirely improvised episode. The second series of the Bafta-winning show ended on an emotional cliffhanger last year as Kay’s character, John, failed to reciprocate the advances of his car share colleague, Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. Car Share viewers were left in dismay when Kay said he wanted to “quit while you’re ahead”. More than 100,000 fans signed an online petition demanding a conclusion to the series.But the comedian later announced a special finale to reveal what happens next for the pair, along with an improvised episode, Car Share: Unscripted.He had said at the time: “We were completely overwhelmed by the response and even though we’ve no plans to write a third series we knew we couldn’t end the story there.”Kay later broke his silence for the first time since he had cancelled his UK tour in December due to “unforeseen family circumstances”, to announce the special screenings, which sold out in minutes. A matinee show in Blackpool was later added due to “exceptional demand”.Kay was praised on social media following the first screening on Friday night, which raised money for The Lily Foundation, a charity working to improve the lives of children with mitochondrial disease. One fan described the finale as a “perfect final episode” and hailed Kay as a “comedy genius” on Twitter. “Watching Car Share at Blackpool Opera House tonight – never in my life laughed so much and so honoured to watch the perfect final ending to Car Share,” another said.

Shock tactics and lively debates are captured in documentary style, but it’s the relationships that gradually come to dominate, particularly a new gay couple for whom the ticking clock of untreatable HIV adds to the passion and poignancy.Detached, deadpan and downright disturbing, this study of teen partners-in-crime follows in the tradition Heathers and Heavenly Creatures, with sharp dialogue and slick camerawork. Study partners Anya Taylor-Joy and Olivia Cooke bond over privilege and bored disillusionment, co-opting hapless Anton Yelchin into their scheme to murder Taylor-Joy’s stepdad.Almost a modern-day Dead of Night, this horror weaves its tales of terror into a grand design. Co-writer and director Nyman plays a paranormal-debunker revisiting three cases that challenge his disbelief in the supernatural: those of Paul Whitehouse, Alex Lawther and Martin Freeman. These episodes are loaded with shock and dread, but common elements hint at a larger pattern connected to Nyman.Anderson’s eye for detail and ear for deadpan go into overdrive in a lovable animated tale. It’s set on a rubbish-dump island off the coast of retro-future Japan, where a band of rogueish mutts help a kid reunite with his pet and overthrow the dog-hating mayor. The story is hardly the point: it’s all about the hand-crafted visuals, eccentric characters and perfectly timed comedy.It’s almost a selling point that this romcom (pictured) is so normal, since its subject is closeted gay teenhood. Simon (Nick Robinson) is forced to contemplate coming out when an online post from an anonymous classmate declares that he, too, is gay. The stakes are raised when their secret chats become more intimate. Someone’s going to have to put their heart on the line.While he spent the last One Direction tour gamely trying to muster some enthusiasm, the immaculately suited Styles seems to have found his comfort zone in 70s-style soft-rock (Two Ghosts) and blustery ballads (Sign of the Times).

Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1 Monday 9 AprilThis new programme from the US’s leading new-music string quartet is typically wide-ranging, with works from the new world – Amy Williams’s Richter Textures and Marcos Balter’s Chambers – alongside two from British composers: Julian Anderson’s Third Quartet (a world premiere) and Brian Ferneyhough’s Dum Transisset.Wigmore Hall, W1, Wednesday 11 AprilThe London Sinfonietta present an evening devoted to the provocative music-theatre of Philip Venables. Hosted by “anti-drag queen” David Hoyle, The Gender Agenda is described as a parody gameshow, highlighting issues of gender equality. It is followed by Venables’s Illusions, which combines live music with video in a wickedly funny, often scabrous tirade. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Thursday 12 AprilIrish National Opera made its debut last month with a revival of Adès’s Powder Her Face, but Patrick Mason’s production of The Marriage of Figaro will be its first bespoke show. Jonathan Lemalu is Figaro with Tara Erraught as Susanna. National Opera House, Wexford, Friday 13 Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, 17 to 21 AprilThe radiance and life of Monet’s art is almost beyond compare, so a chance to see 75 of his paintings is not to be sniffed at. They won’t be the most familiar, either, as this exhibition surveys the little-noticed theme of his fascination with buildings. The paintings of Rouen Cathedral and the Venice skyline are among his most profound. The National Gallery, WC2 Monday 9 April to 29 JulySarah Lucas and Rebecca Warren are among the artists offering uneasy views of our relationships with our bodies in this exhibition taken from the ISelf collection. Warren’s sculptures of independent striding female legs (pictured) typify its surreal perspectives on the human form. Others featured include Tony Cragg and Enrico David. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Tuesday 10 April to 12 AugustThis haunting odyssey through multiverses of history and imagination is a mind-boggling delight. Linder started her career making collages for the Buzzcocks in the heyday of punk and still practises it with poetic vision. She has created a show that is a vast collage of her enthusiasms my favourites include demonic drawings by the architect Inigo Jones and lingerie masks by Linder herself. Nottingham Contemporary, to 24 JuneCharles Demuth’s visionary painting I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold is an American icon. It combines the complex energy of cubism with a bold eye for the modern world that anticipates pop art. This and other classics make for an eye-opening journey through the art of the jazz age. If you thought Jackson Pollock was the first modern American artist who mattered, think again. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, to 22 JulyThe genius of Julia Margaret Cameron (work pictured) stands out in this exhibition about the first photographic avant garde. Cameron, Lewis Carroll, Lady Clementina Hawarden and Oscar Rejlander were friends who shared ideas and even models. All were vivid image-makers but the depth and reality of Cameron’s portraits set her apart. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 20 MayIt may not have been a hit on Broadway but Sting’s musical about the demise of shipbuilding has come home to the north-east in triumph and now sets off on a nationwide tour.

The obvious one is as a metaphor for the destruction of the ancient Syrian city, but it is also a playful, powerful examination of how relationships can break down and turn destructive. Battersea Arts Centre, SW11, Tuesday 10 to 14 April touring to 9 JuneThis devised show is inspired by Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and the life and death of Dr Jacob Bronowski, who popularised science with the 1973 TV series The Ascent of Man. It’s a bold and daring show that melds fact and fiction to fine effect, and is stuffed with big questions about what it is that makes us human as well as our ability to solve the challenges we face as a species. The New Diorama Theatre, NW1, Tuesday 10 April to 5 MayCurious Directive is a pioneering company and its latest show makes innovative use of virtual reality technology in the service of storytelling. Casting the audience as the jury in a court case, the show takes us back in time to 1995 on the Great Barrier Reef where teenager Ashleigh has gone missing. A recreation of childhood and the way memory is deceptive, this is a bold piece of theatre. Not all of it works, but it is always interesting in the way it folds VR into the experience. Shoreditch Town Hall, EC1, to 14 touring to 28 AprilIt is your last chance to catch up with Ian Rickson’s fine revival of Harold Pinter’s play, delivered both with menaces and comedy. Zoë Wanamaker is a joy as Meg, the wittering boarding-house landlady whose attempts at throwing a birthday party go badly wrong when two thugs disrupt the celebrations in search of the guest of honour, a show-stealing Toby Jones. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, to 14 AprilThe always excellent graduate company embraces a typically ambitious range of contemporary and classical work for its annual UK tour, combining extracts from, among others, Matthew Bourne’s Sleeping Beauty, Wayne McGregor’s Far and Christopher Gable’s Cinderella, plus Black Swan, a new work by Jenna Lee. Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds Monday 9 April touring to 14 JulyKudos to Tamara Rojo for persuading William Forsythe to choreograph his first new ballet for a British company in 20 years.

My wardrobe calamities began three years ago, boarding a plane home from England to Northern Ireland. Seatbelt fastened, I realised my favourite sweater was missing. I had, presumably, idly dropped it around the departure gates. But I’d never know. The flight took off. My grey Sunspel sweatshirt with its cute hound dog print was gone, for ever.Things escalated from there. I mislaid a jacket in Osaka, costly shorts in south-west Ireland, another sweater goodness knows where, and the losses got to me. My mother had become unwell and I was travelling home often, trying to hold on to everything – time, memories, my mum – as much as possible. I needed the everyday to be in its right place when everything else was going so wrong, but if I wasn’t packing and unpacking, I was doing laundry, and in the melee items went awol.When I interviewed men about the most cherished items they’d lost, it became clear that the impact was more than just a gap in the wardrobe. Yes, the things we lose are often valuable in themselves: a peaked cap that’s the perfect once-in-a-lifetime fit a pair of brogues so beautiful they ruin every substitute tried on since. But often a trip to Lost Property comes with other baggage. There’s something else we can’t get back: a connection, a memory, a person.I loved that sweater but I loved the time before I lost it more. That was irreplaceable.Introduction by Colin CrummyThere’s barely a photo of me from 2005-2008 where I’m not wearing my Stetson peaked cap. I picked it up in Germany and it was instantly a good fit. I wore an old-time style back then – a peacoat, secondhand second world war boots and grandad cardigans – so the cap suited that.I am a hat man. My girlfriend’s mum used to think I was bald because she never saw me without a hat. But I didn’t really like peaked caps until I saw this one. It was a herringbone tweed, tannish, in a newspaper boy style, and cost about £70. I wore it from spring to autumn and often in the studio, which became part of the problem. There was a spot of blue paint just on the peak that I had stopped noticing.I realised the cap was missing as soon as my girlfriend and I got back to New York from a trip home to Belfast. There was a note from the Transportation Security Administration in the top of my luggage saying they’d rummaged through the bag. I assumed the cap had fallen out of the suitcase. For two years, I was shaking my fist at the TSA for losing my favourite hat.I got married in 2010, which is when my new mother-in-law, Rosemary, came clean. The TSA hadn’t lost my hat. She, in a fit of charity, had tried to get the paint off it in the washing machine, where it just exploded into pieces. She immediately got rid of the evidence.Rosemary is one of the most kind-hearted, gentle women on the planet, so I couldn’t be mad. She told me her heart sank when she reached into the machine for the ball of fluff. But I was glad to get closure.My father was the village chief of Gando. He was illiterate, so when he received letters he would wait weeks for someone from the city to come and read them for him. In the rainy season, it might take months. In 1972, he sent me, his first son, to school in the city, so I could learn to read and write. I was seven years old.I was the first child in the village to go to school. When my father told me, I wondered, what is a school? Then I realised I would leave my family and live with my uncle in Tenkodogo, 20km away. The city seemed far from home and dangerous.I was also the first child in my family to get clothes. In the village, children ran around naked. My father saw that I was afraid to leave, so he bought me a cotton pullover. It cost him a fortune, the equivalent of four chickens. The gift was my father’s way of protecting me, of telling me not to be afraid. At night it got cold, so I used to bring the pullover over my knees. It acted as a second skin. But it also connected me to my family.I returned home four times a year for school holidays. I’d wear my pullover and all the kids would join me on a little hill in Gando and repeat what I’d learned in school, like the alphabet, which they’d sing back.The pullover went missing three years later, after it was left out to dry. I assumed someone liked it as much as I did, but I didn’t really know if it had been stolen or if the wind took it away. I just knew I had lost my protection and the connection to my father. I thought, what will I wear when I go back to the village? What will he say?But my father didn’t punish me. When I returned home, people gathered in the village. My father addressed the crowd. He said that the pullover was old it was time to get a new one. That I was a good boy and he was very proud. He wanted my education to serve the community, so after I became an architect, I asked the people of Gando to join me in creating my first building, a school in the village, which opened in 2001.I saw these beige brogues in Office on a break from work at British Gas in Manchester. The shoes stood out: they were the perfect shape, with a rounded toe, a curve to the arch and a higher heel than usual. I’m average height, 5ft 9in, but that extra half-centimetre gave me confidence. It was like I was tiptoeing in them.The brogues originally cost £130, which was too much for a 19-year-old to afford. But I got the last pair in a sale for £40. I wore them with a pair of slim-fit, indigo Diesel jeans. This was around 2002, when Diesel was hot. The combination was killer. I’d wear them on nights out to Tribeca or Gaia, the dressier bars near Canal Street, where they wouldn’t get trashed. They were the most beautiful, slender shoes every gay man remarked upon them.On a trip to New York, I took the shoes in my carry-on luggage to keep them safe. But on the way back, after buying several pairs of heavy Timberland boots, I put the lighter brogues into checked-in luggage to avoid going over the weight limit. When the bag didn’t turn up on the baggage carousel at Manchester airport, I got that gut feeling similar to when you think you’ve lost your wallet. I spoke to the baggage agent and I was so panicked, she thought I was seriously unwell. The shoes were that important to me. They were just so beautiful.When I see a shoe, I deconstruct it in my head. It comes from spending childhood summers around my grandad’s denim factory in Bury, watching the machinists turn fabric into clothes. After I lost the brogues – which Office had discontinued by this stage – I asked shoemakers in Asia to help me make a similar pair. But they were too hard to replicate. We couldn’t get the specs right. If it had been a piece of clothing, I would have figured it out and made it myself. But making shoes is an art form.I lost a lot of things on my travels but my Felix Gonzalez-Torres T-shirt was the dearest to me. It’s about friendship. The designer Agnès B is one of my oldest friends. She made the T-shirt with Felix, a Cuban conceptual artist, in 1994 and it was so beautiful.It was a very empty T-shirt, blank on the front and on the back it read “Nobody Owns Me”. Felix was a visionary artist. He made these amazing pieces where people could take away the artworks, such as his 1991 Untitled (Portrait of Ross in LA), an installation that is a mound of sweets visitors are encouraged to take from until it disappears. The T-shirt slogan was a statement for personal freedom and independence but also that art belongs to everyone.Much of Felix’s work, like Untitled, was about his late partner, Ross Laycock, who died of complications from Aids. Felix died of an Aids-related illness in 1996. He was only 38 years old. After that, the T-shirt took on new significance for me. It was an amazing, very personal thing of Felix’s to have and it became a way to remember him. I always carried it with me when I travelled. When my suitcase was lost in transit in 2000, it was the first thing I thought of. Everything else was replaceable. I think about that T-shirt all the time. I wonder where it is. Of all the things I’ve lost, it’s the most significant because it’s about the fact that we lost Felix.The only item that I have been really devastated to lose is a jade Buddha pendant that my grandmother, Joan, gave me during my GCSEs in 1996. Her grandfather was Chinese, so she had an affection for chinoiserie. My mum and aunts and uncles all wore a jade pendant or ring. All my great-aunts’ houses were decorated with Chinese figurines and hangings. This was before Buddhas were as commonplace as they are now people didn’t have them all over their gardens.I had heard the story of my great-great-grandfather since I was a kid. Dang Chang came from the Shunde district in China to England for an eye operation in 1899. He opened the first Chinese laundry in Europe, so the legend goes, at 113 Pitt Street in Liverpool.My grandmother died quite suddenly shortly after she gave me the jade pendant. The morning of her funeral, I discovered that the chain was broken. The pendant was given as a rite of passage and was meant to bring luck. It was our family’s superstition that if the jade broke, it was time to stop wearing it.But I wore the jade pendant for a while I was going through my teenage stoner phase, so it worked with my look: black denim with a plaid shirt and Dr Martens boots. When I discovered nightclubs, it didn’t really work with dressing up to go out. I kept it safe in a box somewhere instead but I think someone stole it after a night out. I was really distressed the pendant was the only thing from my nan, apart from a blanket she made me, and it was special to me because I really loved her. Her sisters and cousins married into other Chinese families but she married my grandfather, who was a barrow boy of Irish decent. The jade was a way of hanging on to her heritage.• Commenting on this piece?

They need a maximum of five points from their remaining five fixtures and could be promoted as early as Tuesday, depending on results elsewhere.Cardiff, in contrast, still have a bit to do and the big question is how much the manner of this defeat – their first in the league since New Year’s Day – will take out of Warnock’s players. After all, Cardiff were thrown a lifeline on two occasions here, first when Mike Dean penalised Conor Coady for a push on Anthony Pilkington in the 93rd minute, only for John Ruddy to superbly save Gary Madine’s penalty.The Cardiff fans were still coming to terms with that missed opportunity when Dean awarded another spot-kick, two minutes later, after Ivan Cavaleiro brought down Aron Gunnarsson. This time Junior Hoilett stepped forward, yet the winger also missed, hitting the crossbar with what proved to be the last kick of the game and prompting Nuno to run on to the field to join his euphoric team rather than acknowledge Warnock.The Cardiff manager was in no mood to accept Nuno’s attempts to shake hands on the pitch a little while later – he was captured on camera swearing repeatedly in the Portuguese’s direction – and also made it clear in his post-match press conference that he was not interested in having any sort of conversation in his office.“I don’t give a toss what he says. I won’t accept his apology,” Warnock said. “He’s totally out of order. In British football, you shake the manager’s hand afterwards. I just thought it showed a lack of class if I’m honest. So he can please himself. I went to shake his hand and he ran off – that’s what he did. If that’s how they’re taught in Portugal, fair enough. But not in Britain.”Told that Nuno had said in an interview that he wanted to personally apologise, Warnock replied: “Why would I speak to him? I don’t want to. He can say anything after the game. I’m talking about when the whistle goes, what he should do, the etiquette, the manners, the class. They’ve won the game, for God’s sake. He should shake your hand and say ‘unlucky’. You don’t have to run off like that and rub your nose in it. A disgrace.”Nuno insisted that he regretted his actions. “I am sorry. I hope Neil understands, I tried to tell him, but it’s very difficult to control your emotions when you get two penalties in the final minutes, the only person I had in my mind was John Ruddy, to give him a big hug because today he gave us the victory. But nobody can ever say that I am not a respectful person.”In other news, Neves curled a wonderful 25-yard free-kick into the top corner midway through the second half."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42128a87454983be6c37fcaf07861a97ec4ff326/0_59_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=95c70cbf41ac58e518cf338131394b87 1240w","title":"england women wales women world cup qualifier match report","story":"With Wales topping 2019 World Cup qualifying Group 1 and England a point behind having played a game fewer, this match offered Phil Neville’s side a strong competitive test for his first home outing, against a team with strong qualification ambitions of their own. The Lionesses’ 4-0, 6-0 and 5-0 demolitions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia and Kazakhstan respectively, and runner-up spot at the SheBelieves Cup, may have filled them with confidence but this draw will have measured that and left them ruing not making more of such a possession-heavy display.England began on the front foot, dominating possession, and spent much of the first half camped in the Wales half but it was Jayne Ludlow’s side who will have gone in at half-time feeling hard done by.With Wales defending deep, often dropping to five at the back, England were held to long-range efforts and set pieces, unable to break through such a well-rehearsed back line. The deep defending left Kayleigh Green (converted from a defender to a forward by Ludlow) isolated up front but Wales were not without chances of their own and they should have taken the lead in the eighth minute from a rare Wales corner delivered by Angharad James. The ball rolled teasingly through the box, taking a number of deflections and falling at the feet of Natasha Harding whose shot crossed the line before being booted clear. But the referee waved away Welsh appeals for the goal.At the other end England pushed and pushed at the Welsh back line but were crowded out in the centre. Toni Duggan, forced to go long, had a shot pushed on to the post by Laura O’Sullivan and the overworked keeper held the Lionesses at bay again as she tipped a Jordan Nobbs 30-yard screamer on to the bar.With the approach to the stadium filled with families, in particular young girls, and only two corners of St Mary’s kept empty while the rest of the stadium was filled with a crowd ofmore than 25,000 , the atmosphere was electric. Neville’s confidence of a Wembley outing in the next year looked increasingly likely as the Lionesses’ showed they can fill a Premier League ground.England started the second half much like the first but Duggan, Nikita Parris, Fran Kirby and Jodie Taylor were unable to keep the ball down in the box and string any passes between them. However, the introduction of Ellen White for Taylor and Melissa Lawley for Parris injected pace. Manchester City’s Lawley caused all kinds of trouble for Rhiannon Roberts with pacy runs and swift crosses from the left. Birmingham’s White stuck herself between the centre-backs Hayley Ladd and Loren Dykes, pulling them away from the dangerous Lawley.Seattle Reign’s Jess Fishlock looked to be Wales’s most threatening outlet on the counter, first racing from her own area but unable to find Green with her desperate through-ball. Later another Nobbs corner slid to the edge of the box and was picked off by Fishlock who broke free, with Harding at her side, only for Keira Walsh to make a brilliant tackle as the last player.With nine minutes left Neville amused the crowd and angered the fourth official when he stepped on to the pitch to help Green after she had gone down with cramp in front of him.In the closing stages England continued to seek a winner, Nobbs again testing the superb O’Sullivan, who tipped the ball into the path of Walsh, but she could only steer her shot into the side netting. Kirby’s strike in the 90th minute from the edge of the area brought O’Sullivan to full stretch.At the full-time whistle the Wales players and staff leapt into the air as if celebrating a win and danced in the centre circle while the England players walked the perimeter to applaud the fans. But having had their backs to the wall for the majority of the 90 minutes Wales deserved to soak up the single point gained from their defensive labour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbdbb0a02ec6312f963a100bfb465c59b94f160/0_146_4211_2526/master/4211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6e0d263cc49b87b61a842abe870921b4 1240w","title":"kevin de bruyne manchester city jose mourinho chelsea","story":"Kevin De Bruyne is as cool about being rejected by José Mourinho as he is when dismantling opponents with his laser-like midfield passes for Manchester City. It is the morning after the night before following City’s 3-0 trouncing by Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Despite the disappointment, De Bruyne, dressed in a white No\u0026nbsp17 City training top, is in eloquent form.The Belgian is content to recall being sold to Wolfsburg in January 2014 when Mourinho was in charge at Chelsea and how this helped make him pivotal in a City team who are a glaring 16 points ahead of Manchester United. In Saturday’s Manchester derby Mourinho knows if De Bruyne can be stymied United will go a long way to preventing Pep Guardiola’s side from sealing the title against their fiercest rivals in front of their own crowd.De Bruyne bounced back from being discarded by Mourinho to become one of the game’s top footballers and is a firm contender for the player of the year award. In his sole full season in the Bundesliga he was the 2014-15 footballer of the year, winning him a move to City for a then club-record £55m.Asked about his experience under Mourinho, De Bruyne strikes a calm note. “I really don’t care,” the 26-year-old says. “It’s just part of football – it goes up and down. In the 10 years I’ve been playing, nine and a half years have been up and a half year has been a bit down.“I can be really happy with the way it’s gone because a lot of people go up and down, up and down. I’ve had the feeling that gradually I’ve got better and better. That was an experience where I learned maybe the most out of how football goes, how I go with the situation. I was only 21 at the time – no one is going to play all the time at that age. If I see the amount of games I’ve played in my career it’s a lot, so I’m happy.”De Bruyne’s principal challenger for the player of the year awards is Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian is another player in whom Mourinho showed scant faith, allowing him to go out on loan to Fiorentina and Roma after signing the forward for Chelsea in January 2014.“Everyone needs to find a system and playing style that suits. Probably now we’ve found somebody who suits us both more than it was before. In both our cases that’s true but that’s the same for a lot of players. It’s just because it’s the same manager and it’s both of us in the same season who are going well that people are talking about it. But every manager will have had a lot of players who were not suited with each other, who went away and did well. I’m not really that type of person who thinks about that. It’s just the way it goes, in life, in football.”December’s reverse fixture ended in a 2-1 win for City at Old Trafford. Afterwards Mourinho was involved in a bust-up with Guardiola’s players after he went to the dressing room to ask that their music be turned down and more respect shown.De Bruyne is defiant when asked if there may be a repeat. “The volume is always up,” he says. “It’s our way to prepare for games, the music is on before the game and after, so it’s not like because we won we’re going to change, it’s just because it’s the thing we do, it’s the thing that gets us relaxed, maybe.“Some teams don’t do music but a lot of teams I’ve played in have. Obviously the dressing rooms are mostly close to each other but it’s not to mock anybody.”City are closing in on a slew of records. Beat United and they will be champions with a record-breaking six matches to spare They would jump to 87 points and have a chance of eclipsing the 95 of Mourinho’s 2004-05 title winners.De Bruyne is unsure what strength of side Guardiola will field. “I can understand the feeling of supporters,” he says. “But I don’t know what the coach wants to do. We have four games in 10 days or something so it’s his decision. I know how it goes between fans on social media, how it goes after games. That’s their thing, naturally. All the players are desperate to play every game. You perform for 10 months on a good level to try to get to these sort of games, and hopefully you can finish it off well.”Those four matches comprise Liverpool away and home in the Champions League, United’s visit and then next Saturday’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur. De Bruyne displays confidence, as he has to, that City will be unaffected by the Liverpool defeat despite a first half in which they were torn apart.“The last time we lost a game we showed a reaction which is a good thing,” he says of the 3-0 EFL Cup final win over Arsenal that followed a 1-0 defeat at Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup. “I’m not saying we’re going to win the game it’s going to be tough. We just played and Saturday is early but we will try everything to win that game and then we will see.”De Bruyne’s vision on the pitch can be sublime. In October’s 7-2 thrashing of Stoke a delightful reverse pass to Leroy Sané nullified seven defenders before the German picked out Raheem Sterling for the home side’s second goal.De Bruyne offers a modest take on the whole thing. “You can’t train for that kind of ball,” he says. “Because it’s almost never going to happen, that that situation is going to be there, that the defence is going to be open and in that line.”He is more upbeat over the prospect of City retaining the title, an achievement managed only by United and Chelsea in the Premier League era. “To maintain it is always more difficult than to win it the first time,” he says, “but I have the feeling this time we can go on.”He finishes with an intriguing insight into Guardiola’s style. “If you speak one to one, he can be very close to you,” De Bruyne says. “But I guess, when you’re a coach, you need to have a bit of space between you and the player. He’s your boss and so you have to do what he asks you to do, and if you’re too close it can lead to problems with players, if they see that. So it’s a fine balance for a manager but the way he does it for this team is good.”Against United, City hope to restore the equilibrium that was shattered at Anfield on Wednesday. As ever, De Bruyne will be key."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ca9cecf6d26a6bc579a8b44a48297478f84e84a/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=852f913120bf93a1c225bf59aec9c655 1240w","title":"everton v liverpool premier league live","story":"2 min It’s the usual fast start in a Liverpool match - but this time it’s from Everton.

They’re dropping like flies. I know it’s only Alberto Moreno but if Andy Roberts- actually, no, I’ve defeated my own argument with the words ‘Alberto Moreno’. As you were.“Hi Rob,” says Aaron Alexander. “Can you possibly confirm if this would be a first team debut for 19-yr-old Irish centre half Conor Masterson, who joined Liverpool at the age of 13? Cheers.”What’s it worth?(Yes, it would.)Matt Loten’s got beef about teef “How could Simon possibly leave out Suarez when talking about Liverpool and significant sets of teeth? He may not be the hipster’s choice but when it comes to Mersey-based, headline-grabbing chompers, Suarez surely can’t be beat.”Tacticswatch “Any chance that Liverpool 4-3-3 is actually a 3-4-3 with Clyne and Milner as wing backs?” asks Neil Creasey. “I think I’d rather play it that way than have Klavan at left back.”Oh darling, there’s always a chance. But I doubt it.“Greetings Rob,” says Simon McMahon Klopp really does have the most magnificent set of gnashers. Possibly the finest since Frank McAvennie. Or, for slightly different reasons, Joe Jordan.”Tell it to Kenny Burns. I wish there was footage of this. Jurgen Klopp speaks! “Mo is injured, but hopefully he’ll be available for Tuesday. It’s the same with Robbo (Andy Robertson). We need fresh legs so that’s why we’ve made changes, I don’t know exactly how many we’ve made. Everton deserve all our respect and we know it will be a tough game.”Liverpool make five changes, though they still have a pretty strong side. Roberto Firmino is on the bench Mo Salah is not. Everton bring in Tom Davies for Dominic Calvert-Lewin.Morning! The Merseyside derby is often the most important game of the season for those involved. This time, it’s not even the biggest game of the week. Liverpool go to Manchester City in the Champions League on TuesdayIf Liverpool rest players – and Jurgen Klopp would be a damn gegenpressing fool to not do so – Everton will have a decent chance of their first derby win since 2010. A victory would give their supporters banter rights for a few months, and might even improve Poor Old Sam’s popularity rating by 0.00001 per cent. The alternative scenario, of being embarrassed by Liverpool Reserves, can be filed under unthinkable.We know Sam Allardyce is probably done at Everton. Some tides can’t be turned. If he found a way to create an economic boom and bring back world peace, some supporters would still accuse him of a being a dinosaur who is out of touch with modern life. But he can still be a hero today.The Everton fans’ complaints have been more about style than results but this is one day when they won’t care if their team has 2.4 per cent possession and scores the winning goal from a long goalkick that bounces in off Wayne Rooney’s appreciable derriere. It’s been far too long since Everton beat Liverpool, and the bigger picture can wait till next week. For them, this really is the most important game of the season.Kick off is at 12.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fc595a3373a0cb2ffdbaacdf582381ac0e057f/0_0_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d79e2a37d9908dbf6532da27d080f547 1240w","title":"elena ferrante ever since adolescence i have liked the term unknown","story":"I can devote myself to the pure result of a creative gesture, without worrying about a big or small nameAmong the paintings in the Pio Monte della Misericordia, in Naples – the same splendid space that houses the famous Caravaggio devoted to the seven acts of mercy – there is a work that fascinates me and that I go and see whenever I can. It’s the figure of a nun with hands joined, eyes closed and an ecstatic expression. The cartouche on the right says it’s “Our Lady Of Soledad”, a 17th century work by an unknown artist.Ever since adolescence, I’ve liked the term “unknown”. It means that all I can know of the person who made this painting is the work I have before my eyes. I find it a great opportunity. I can devote myself to the pure result of a creative gesture, without worrying about a big or small name. Before me is simply the composition of a human being who summoned his inventive energy and, rejecting countless other possible ways of using his time, fought with the raw material of colours to place on this surface – from within a tradition he had behind him, and with all the ability he was capable of, forgetting even himself – his personal figure of a woman praying.The more I look at the nun, the better I know the unknown artist of the 17th century. Not through biographical facts, not through his life story, but through his expressive strategies. In them I find inscribed in full another story – his story as an artist, which is a story of aesthetic choices, of compositional intelligence, of the grammar and syntax of an image, of feelings given shape. In the work of art, biography and autobiography have a truth completely different from that which we attribute to a CV or an income tax return. In that space there is, there has to be, a freedom of invention that allows one to violate all the agreements about truth in everyday life. To be clear: the artist of Our Lady Of Soledad is unknown to me only on the historical-biographical level. He is very well known to me, on the other hand, in the exercise of his function as an author – so well known that I could give to that function, for convenience, a name, for example, a female name.It would not be a pseudonym, that is, a false name it would be the only true name used to identify her imaginative power, her ability. Every other label would be problematic, would bring into the work precisely that which has been kept out of it, so that it would stay afloat in the great river of forms. Naturally the game could also be extended to artists whom, wrongly, we don’t consider “Unknown”. If I had to give to the creative act of Seven Acts Of Mercy the name Caravaggio, and to the biographically determined person, the name Michelangelo Merisi, I would choose to spend the greater part of my time with Caravaggio, and not with Merisi. Merisi would blur my vision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a524226d87d02adea40af901414350ecec905c5/0_261_3882_2328/master/3882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=79ff9ea1d1864751b2e86f0c6b1cf767 1240w","title":"tim dowling i love watching other people work","story":"To me, the appeal is obvious: all the satisfaction and accomplishment of work, without the workI am in the kitchen, watching Kitch the electrician put a new light in the ceiling.

I spent most of August standing at my bedroom window watching four men paint a school, ducking out of sight whenever one of them turned around.

Our friend Anna, who is a garden designer and knows about these things, has come to show us where to stick them. The middle one, just home from university, is being paid to help out. I see them as I cross the garden in the morning, coffee in hand, on my way to my computer.“Are we going to be disturbing you, digging and planting while you’re trying to work?” Anna asks.“Nope,” I say.“Disturbing him?” my wife says.“I’ll be fine,” I say. “I’m used to it.”“If you think you’re going to sit in that box all day watching us do everything,” my\u0026nbspwife says.“Actually, I have business in town,” I say.“What business?” she says.“Business business,” I say.“He’s got a lot going on, your husband,” Anna says.“He doesn’t,” my wife says. “He’s lying.”My business – technically more of an errand – takes about an hour. When I get back, all the plants are still in their pots, although they have been set in their positions along the empty beds. “Looks good,” I say. “I’ll get out of your way.”“What are you talking about?” my wife says. “You’re helping.”I am assigned the northern end of the left bed. My first strike with the spade hits something hard, causing my fillings to vibrate like tuning forks. I fish up the broken corner of a concrete paving slab, followed by the rest of the paving slab, followed by the paving slab next to it. My shoulder blades burn. Sweat runs off the end of my nose. It’s tough work, I think, but honest.“Why are you making those noises?” my\u0026nbspwife says.“What noises?” I say.“The grunting and wincing,” she says.“I hit a slab,” I say.“No one else is making noises,” she says. “Anna’s not sighing and groaning.”“It’s all construction rubble at this end,” I say.“Your son isn’t muttering and swearing under his breath,” she says.“He’s planting peonies,” I say. “I’m excavating a Roman villa.”“You are making a lot of noise,” the middle one says.“Stop listening to me work,” I say.“We can’t,” my wife says.A week later, I’m in my office when I\u0026nbspcatch sight of my wife crossing the grass with Kitch the electrician, here to\u0026nbspinstall the outdoor light. She pulls open the door, and I stand. “Coffee, two sugars,” Kitch says. “Your missus can’t work the machine.”“Just finishing some business,” I say.“We could see you,” my wife says. “You were sitting there reading a book.”“That’s not true,” I say. And it isn’t. I was sitting there holding a book, fast asleep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9239a2eb0833c753992beb2fbb0842e8e8419470/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=211b91e835612813e18c6450af368cef 1240w","title":"where to move for retirement property","story":"Groovier baby boomers will return to cities, but generally they retire to Britain’s southern and East Anglian coastsBetween the ages of 18 and 65, the British population undergoes an astonishing metamorphosis.

It’s the fattiness of some cuts versus the relative leanness of others, allied to pork’s rather neutral flavour – it’s not beef, and definitely not lamb – that opens it up to ingredients as erse as whisky, fish sauce, orange, caraway and ginger. I love this ersity – especially the ability to mix and match flavours on a global scale.This works very well just as it is, but serve with mashed potato if you want an even heartier meal.400g pork mince70g fresh breadcrumbs (from 2 slices white crustless bread)2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves15g parsley, roughly chopped2 tsp lemon zest (ie, from 2 lemons)½ tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp caraway seeds½ tsp chilli flakesSalt and black pepper1 tbsp vegetable oil40g unsalted butter1 cabbage, cut in half and then into 5mm-thick strips2 tsp dark brown soft sugar300ml vegetable stock250g soured cream, to serveIn a large bowl, combine the mince, breadcrumbs, garlic, a tablespoon of thyme, a third of the parsley, a teaspoon of lemon zest, all the spices, a half-teaspoon of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Form the mix into roughly 20 walnut-sized balls, each weighing about 25g.Heat the oil in a large saute pan on a high flame, then fry the meatballs (in batches, if need be) for about three minutes, turning them so they go golden brown all over, then transfer to a plate.Return the pan to a high heat – don’t worry about wiping it clean –and add the butter. Once it sizzles, add the cabbage and fry for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until caramelised and dark golden brown.Stir in the sugar, the remaining tablespoon of thyme and a teaspoon of salt, then pour in the stock. Return the meatballs to the pan, turn down the heat to medium-low, cover and leave to simmer for eight minutes. Remove the lid, return the heat to high, and cook for four to five minutes more, until the liquid reduces to about 150ml.Divide the cabbage and meatballs between four bowls. Mix the remaining 10g parsley with a teaspoon of lemon zest, and sprinkle on top. Serve with a generous dollop of soured cream.If you can, marinate the pork overnight to really get the flavours into the meat if you’re pushed for time, though, two hours will do. This same treatment would also work very well on chicken thighs. If you can’t get hold of barberries, use chopped dried cranberries instead. Serve with herby rice and vegetables on the side.1 tbsp Chinese five-spice2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1½ tsp paprika5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1½ tbsp maple syrup60ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 pork fillet (about 500-600g)For the salsa 35g dried barberries, soaked for a few minutes in boiling water, then drained (or chopped dried cranberries)45g parsley, picked and finely chopped1½ tsp red-wine vinegarFinely grated zest of 1 large lemon, to get 1½ tsp1½ tbsp olive oil1 pinch caster sugarFlaked sea salt and black pepperPut the first five ingredients in a large bowl with three tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Add the pork, rub the marinade into the meat, then cover and refrigerate for at least two hours and ideally overnight.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a high heat. Lift the pork from its marinade, then sear for about four minutes, turning often, so it turns golden brown on all sides. Transfer the meat to a roasting tray, spoon over the marinade and roast for about 10-15 minutes, depending on how well done you like your pork. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for five minutes. Put all the salsa ingredients in a bowl with a third of a teaspoon of salt and some pepper, then stir to make a coarse salsa.When you’re ready to eat, carve the pork into 1.5-2cm-thick slices and ide between the plates. Spoon the cooking juices over the top, sprinkle lightly with salt and serve with the salsa spooned alongside or over the meat.Pork neck fillet (which is also known as collar) is a very forgiving cut that has plenty of fat running through it (if you can’t get hold of neck, use shoulder instead). The meat will really benefit if you can leave it in its marinade for two days, but four hours is the bare minimum. This is perfect served with boiled rice to soak up the sweet, sharp sauce.100ml whisky125ml fish sauce150g soft light brown sugar5 lemongrass stalks, trimmed, outer leaves discarded, then finely chopped9cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 1kg pork neck fillet1½ tbsp vegetable oil, for grilling1 lime, quarteredFor the nam jim80ml freshly squeezed orange juice (ie, from 2 oranges)½ tbsp basmati rice¾ tbsp pul biber (Turkish chilli flakes) (or half that amount normal chilli flakes), gently toasted20g tamarind paste40ml fish sauce1 tbsp maple syrup1 shallot, peeled and finely diced 5g coriander leaves, finely choppedFor the herb salad150g red cabbage, or white cabbage, sliced radish or cucumber, finely shredded2-3 spring onions, finely sliced on an angle5g mint leaves, roughly torn5g coriander leavesPut the whisky, fish sauce and sugar in a medium pan on a medium-high heat and gently warm for a few minutes, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the lemongrass and ginger, turn off the heat and leave to cool completely.Cut the pork against the grain into four 12cm-long and 6cm-wide pieces, then cut away and discard any silverskin. Transfer the meat to a non-reactive container that is just big enough to hold all the pieces in one layer, then pour over the cooled marinade and make sure the pork is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Lift the pork from its container and dry well with kitchen towel (don’t discard the marinade it can be frozen and used again for marinating alternatively, cook it down and, once reduced, use to glaze, say, chicken drumsticks). Brush each piece with a little oil and set aside. Ventilate the kitchen and put a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Once the pan is smoking hot, lay in the pork pieces (in batches if need be) and cook for four to five minutes on each side, until golden brown and nicely marked with char lines (turn down the heat a little if it looks like the meat is starting to burn).Put the browned meat on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper, and roast for 10-12 minutes, until cooked through, then remove from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest for 10 minutes.While the meat is cooking and resting, make the nam jim. Put the orange juice in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and simmer for about four minutes, until it’s reduced to about 60ml, then leave to cool a little.At the same time, toast the rice in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat for four to five minutes, until it starts to colour and smell nutty. Transfer the toasted rice to a spice grinder or mortar, add the chilli and blitz or pound to a coarse powder. Combine this with all the remaining ingredients for the nam jim and set aside.Gently toss all the ingredients for the salad. Cut each piece of meat widthways into five, and serve warm with the herb salad, the nam jim poured over both of them and a lime wedge alongside.

It is comfortably embedded in its fleshpots while shovelling steaming piles of ordure on its members.This week, Guido was first to report on Jeremy Corbyn’s seder dinner with the left-wing Jewish group Jewdas. The site’s detractors accuse it of misrepresenting left-wing Jewish groups in the row over antisemitism, but as Boris Johnson, then London mayor, put it at that 10th anniversary party, Guido has long been the dung on the rosebush of politics.Once, in the early days back in 2004 when the website, a kind of knock-off of the pioneering Popbitch gossip site, had barely 100 hits a week, the identity of Guido was a closely guarded secret. But Paul Staines, now in his early 50s, has become familiar in TV studios and last year he claimed nearly a million hits a week on the various Guido sites. Staines, a former Hong Kong trader, is now editor-in-chief of an outfit with a seven-section website covering tech and media as well as politics. One of Guido’s writers is a member of the Westminster lobby, the very organisation he once castigated as the epitome of backscratching journalistic corruption.He swaggers along what ought to be the tricky line between feeding off politicians and biting them, often with a drink in hand. Five years ago he told the Guardian: “I still hate politicians. My contempt for them is undiminished.” The politicians know this, but they appear to nervous of crossing him. “We cringe and simper around Guido,” Johnson said at the anniversary celebration, “in the pathetic delusion that we may thereby encourage him to be merciful to us.” Guido does not hate all politicians equally. He is a committed Brexiter: remainers get a particular beating on the Euro Guido pages, where their referendum predictions are vigilantly policed (the same treatment is not applied to Brexit promises). And though Staines insists anything stupid or hypocritical is fair game, he appears to find politicians on the left disproportionately worthy of his opprobrium.But then it is no secret that his politics are right wing, free market, Thatcherite. At university in Hull in the 1980s he was a member of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation so right-wing that it was disbanded by Mrs Thatcher. “I never wore a ‘Hang Mandela’ badge, but I hung out with people who did …” he once said. Later he worked for close Thatcher fixers like David Hart, and he reminisces about Africa and AK-47s like a character from late LeCarre.His breakthrough was to see early on just how the alcohol-fuelled gossip and backbiting of Westminster that makes and breaks inidual careers could be translated to, and magnified by, the digital blogosphere. He recognised how the world of the political gang, of in and out, of foolishness and deceit and political manipulation and retribution could have been purposely designed to provide rolling content for the voracious appetite of a news website.What he created was a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine. Its common denominator is to belittle politicians, and anyone else (currently the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr for her award-winning expose on Cambridge Analytica) with whom he disagrees.The website is no stranger to the law courts, and Staines has boasted that he likes a good vendetta. But from time to time the procession of gossip, recycled tweets and leaks from the special advisers and bag carriers who provide the daily bread and butter for the site is interrupted with a serious story. Staines claims the scalp of the former Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth, Michael Hancock, who stood down after it emerged that he had had an inappropriate relationship with a constituent. The site also demolished the career of Damian McBride, who it discovered was planning to smear senior Tories, and had a leading part in the destruction of Chris Huhne, another LibDem MP, over the speeding offence that ultimately forced his resignation and ended his marriage. The website sets stories running. It rarely does the hard slog of hunting them down. For example, it heard well sourced reports about bullying by MPs of staff, but it appears never to have tried to build up the kind of case that could prevent injustices being perpetuated. Instead it chucks a rock of innuendo into the pool and moves on, always hungry for a new way of entertaining its readers, while confirming their prejudices. Staines might one day be a footnote in the history of democracy, but his purpose has never been to promote its long-term health. • This article was corrected on 7 April 2018. Chris Huhne was involved in a speeding offence, not a drink-driving one, as stated in an earlier version."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19332f231bafc87430b138e4aaf054cb36c27429/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b54c2f5755cfb1689c374641e1a2ec2a 1240w","title":"retirement can you make your pension last at least 20 years","story":"Now comes the much bigger challenge: making the money you save last two, and possibly three, decades of retirement.In the past, employees in final salary-based schemes had certainty about the income they would receive annually, and the security that it would be paid every year until their death. Now, outside of the public sector, that security has all but vanished. “Here’s the £106,000 you saved. Cheerio and good luck to you” is, basically, what you’re going to hear. £106,000, by the way, is the average amount 55- to 65-year-olds currently have saved in a workplace “defined contribution” pension, according to pension company Aegon.Will you get much advice? Probably not – many professional advisers will turn their noses up at such small sums (to them). And finding a decent adviser is a lottery in itself.You will also need to learn an ugly new word – “decumulation” – and take some big guesses about your health and longevity. The single biggest problem with managing your money in retirement is that you don’t know when you’ll die, or whether or not you will need expensive long-term care.The potential for rip-offs is enormous. That’s why the pension minister, Guy Opperman, must take on board recommendations this week from the work and pensions select committee and create a low-cost deal at retirement which is as automatic as the current enrolment system.The weirdness of our market-based pension system is that Nest, the government-owned body that delivers auto-enrolment for many small employers, is forbidden from offering drawdown or other decumulation plans. Why? Because they will probably do it cheaper than the profit-seeking private companies.This nonsense has to end. Nest must provide a low-cost benchmark service for managing your money through retirement – and in effect force the private companies to fall in line.But none of this is going to lessen the challenge of saving enough first. The grim reality is that while £106,000 sounds like a lot of money, it is peanuts when it comes to pensions. It will give you an income of less than £5,000 a year in retirement – and leaves you wide open to the vagaries of inflation and any stock market collapses. If you want an income of £25,000 a year in retirement – consisting of £8,300-a-year state pension as well as a £16,700-a-year private pension – that many say is the benchmark for a decent life, you will have to save north of £300,000.But don’t get too depressed – if you are a couple, both 40, with no savings so far, but can stretch to putting aside £40 per week each into a pension scheme, then it’s (just) possible to hit the £25,000 a year target income that many experts say is what you need in retirement. Good luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8011c277449c449a6dd2771472126fb013bdec/0_403_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f40f2bcd031987459c130945bf6c689 1240w","title":"the aa fees prices introductory offer","story":"Is the AA exploiting its most loyal customers – the elderly but also the very busy – by automatically renewing annual breakdown cover at up to twice the original price, in the expectation many won’t notice?That’s the allegation from two AA staff members who have contacted Guardian Money keen to expose the “shameful and embarrassing” way they claim the breakdown recovery business now operates.The contracts they sign mean their policy is automatically renewed every year, which the salespeople described as a “scandal” as they say it leads to people overpaying for policies that they no longer want or, in many cases, will never claim on, as they may have sold their car.The AA is by no means alone in offering teaser first-year discounts. But the salespeople who contacted Guardian Money say it’s the scale and the manner of the second-year increase that sets the company apart.The AA, with 3.3 million breakdown members, vigorously rejects these claims, adding that it has made “great progress in the last couple of years to be much clearer and transparent in pricing and selling”.Our whistleblowers say they have spoken out in part because they are fed up with being verbally attacked by customers on the receiving end of steep price rises.Each year, four out of five AA customers decide to renew. But the complicated pricing tariff used by the salespeople, and seen by Money, shows by how much fees are hiked in the second year.Its popular joint membership, that covers roadside assistance and home start, is £109 for “new” customers. But at the end of the first year, that rises to £215 with the money taken out under a continuous payment authority. The AA says it does this so customers aren’t left without cover.“Everyone thinks that the AA is there to help but, from what we’ve seen, it’s about one thing – sucking people in on a super-cheap price before moving them on to a higher rate. There’s a guy who sold his car two years ago who ended up paying the AA for two years’ cover because they’d moved house and not told the AA. When he realised, it was too late to get his money back,” says one of the AA staff, who have asked to remain anonymous.The second says it is the AA’s Gold members that he feels most sorry for. “I went to the dentist and, as I had my AA uniform on, he proudly told me he was an AA Gold member. Out of interest, I asked what he was paying. When I told him what a new customer on the exact same package would pay – half of what he was paying – he was furious. As I left, he was getting on the phone to give them hell, but he wouldn’t have got a refund of any previous years’ overpayments.”• People from eastern Europe, who have poor English, are often promised European cover is included when it is not. They only find this out when they break down, and have their claim declined.• Iniduals are sold a more expensive “any car” policy even though they only ever use one.• Customers complaining have to wait until their policy has lapsed for 90 days before they can rejoin via the field sales team at the discounted price.• AA Gold members (those who have been members for five years or more) are often paying twice as much as a customer who has just joined from the RAC. The AA’s data shows its customers typically stay with the firm for 12 years.AA president Edmund King says: “We are very clear about putting our members at the heart of what we do and delivering excellent service. Treating customers fairly is built into all of our policies and processes, and into the training of all our people whatever their role in the AA.“We have worked hard to promote our great products in a fair and transparent way. We do offer discounted introductory offers (via a sales force, online call centres and in advertising).He says the AA writes to all customers before renewal, at which point they have a choice whether to renew or not. “Any customer can benefit from introductory offers via the call centre or with the direct sales force so there is no ‘discrimination’ if one doesn’t have access to the internet. Our letters are very clear and go far beyond much that is seen in the commercial world. We are proud to comply with the FCA’s requirements on renewal transparency.”In regard to customers moving home and not seeing renewal letters, King says: “We have strengthened all of our procedures for following up on returned mail when people have moved. We use a range of methods to re-establish contact.”What you tell us“I called the AA to cancel and was immediately offered a refund of £123, taking us back to the previous price. I was told ‘We did not overcharge you – we charged you the full price and now we are giving you a discount’.“I called the AA to cancel and was immediately offered a refund of £123, taking us back to the previous price.

Stroll through the clothes racks and towards the checkout, past the mini cacti, glittery photo frames and avocado bed linen, and you’ll find a selection of books. “READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE INSTAGRAM FAMOUS,” screams one in all-caps, while next to it whispers another called The Little Book of Self-Care. It’s emblematic of an identity crisis that is engulfing a whole generation – the so-called fame-hungry narcissists v hyper-aware over-thinkers – and one that’s increasingly being reflected by its pop stars. Recently, it gained its anthem in the shape of We Are Fucked by 18-year-old Noah Cyrus (featuring Mø), a surprisingly self-lacerating, Max Martin-produced nihilistic banger that simmers with frustration at Cyrus’s generation’s social media addiction and her fears for how it might hobble their future.For Cyrus, her personal social media addiction is Instagram, which she first started using when she was 12. “I wake up and the first thing I check is Instagram and I don’t think that’s a healthy state of mind,” she says. “Youth culture is wrapped up in social media. Instagram tells us you need to look a certain way to be famous. Everybody’s obsessed and I think it’s endangering young people and what we think youth culture has to be.”So why is it Cyrus’s generation specifically (Generation Z is roughly marked as those born anywhere between the mid-1990s and mid-00s) who are starting to sing about it, and why with such anger? How does it fit alongside previous acts of musical nihilism that grew out of the punk scene in the 70s, grunge in the 90s and hip-hop’s recent downbeat turn? Recent Universal Music signing, the Swedish singer-songwriter LOVA, AKA 19-year-old Lova Alvilde, actively eschews writing about some of pop’s typical themes (love, heartbreak, being “in da club”). Her forthcoming EP will focus instead on the false idea of perfection generated by social media, with forthcoming single Insecurities being the first taste. “For me, writing about social media and its effect on people has always felt like a very natural and important thing to do,” she says. “I think it’s going to be hard not to write about it, especially for younger, upcoming artists. Social media is such a current factor, not only in my life but for almost every person of my generation, so that makes it a more obvious thing to write about. I want to open up to conversations about how society is shaping us into not talking about the things that actually matter.”Alvilde’s frustrations with social media’s addictive cycle of false affirmation also chime with We Are Fucked (the chorus of which runs “We are fucked These days we only follow These days we’re feeling hollow”). “We have basically been told to believe and trust that the ‘perfect’ life that social media is portraying is the one we should all strive for,” she says. “That then makes it harder for us to break free from it and see how far from reality it actually is.”While skewed-pop duo Let’s Eat Grandma, AKA teenagers Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth, set their 2016 debut album I, Gemini in otherworldly landscapes, recent single Hot Pink came with a video that played on that falsity referred to by Alvilde. Their new album I’m All Ears comes peppered with references to mobile phones. “I really enjoy TV shows and music and media generally where they reference the fact that people spend time on their phones,” says Hollingworth. “It seems odd to me in films where they don’t use their phones once, when it’s set in 2018. That’s not what people’s lives are like now we connect with each other through the internet whether you like it or not. We’ve always been interested in playing with the idea of people’s perceptions being altered by the media and phones and the internet.”For Generation Z, the whole approach to social media in the first place is different to how the baby boomers or Generations X and Y approached it in the past. Ruban Nielson, frontman of psych-pop experimentalists Unknown Mortal Orchestra, whose new album Sex \u0026amp Food investigates what we as a society consume and how it affects us, thinks this is a key point as to why it’s becoming more of pressing concern. “When you talk to someone who is a baby boomer or Generation X about all this they would say: ‘This is the real me, and this is the version of me on social media,’” he says. “But the thing that is really monstrous about it is that for younger people who have it as a more formative part of their identity, you might end up with no real ‘me’ behind the social media. All the emphasis will be put on social media to actually represent the full scope of who you are and there might not be a identity behind that. That’s more terrifying. I have two children and I protect them as much as possible from that stuff but there’s no way to socialise your children without acknowledging that these things are out there.”While Dr Aaron Balick, author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, agrees that “for Generation Z, social media is more embedded into the social fabric than previous generations”, he also sees this as not wholly negative. “On the one hand, the social self as represented online is in some ways a fundamental, but young people are savvy too, and are capable of engaging with it critically.”Balick sees We Are Fucked’s attack on ruptured identities as more of a wake-up call than a shrug: “This song represents that criticism, drawing attention to the fact that a postured presentation of self could be a direct road to being fucked.” Even within the song, Cyrus offers an olive branch when she sings: “We’ve got hearts in the right places But we’re still a danger to ourselves Maybe it’s cuz we are young”.“We are good people,” she tells the Guide. “I would like to consider myself an amazing person but I’m still an addict. Not just Instagram, but all social media. We’re wasting time.”It’s this sense of acting on frustration, of wanting to change, that not only distinguishes Gen Z from the more stereotypically spoiled millennials, but sets Cyrus’s We Are Fucked apart from more typical teenage nihilism.Songwriter Savan Kotecha, who co-wrote We Are Fucked alongside Cyrus and Swedish pop alchemist Max Martin, agrees. “The youth are so articulate and bright and aware. We’re going to see more of that, I think they can sense when something’s wrong, even if they don’t have all the answers.” Kotecha says that, from other sessions he has been in, more and more artists of Cyrus’s age are starting to write not only about the identity crises social media inflicts, but wider issues affecting their generation.“I’ve noticed that in the last six or seven months: more artists wanting to discuss things they wouldn’t a year ago,” he says. “For American artists, there’s a sense of responsibility. Pop should be fun and escapist, of course, but it’s the artists who feel they can be heard who want to put some of that in the music.” He lists the likes of Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Lorde and Cyrus as examples. “It’s hard for a pop artist who’s known for doing fun songs to get super political, but they’re figuring it out.”We Are Fucked should be taken in a wider context of the next generation of pop stars becoming more aware of, and critiquing, their surroundings. It is also part of a conversation about the positives and negatives of social media that’s as blurred and seemingly contradictory as Urban Outfitters’ books selection, and more complex than Jack White is willing to understand.“I truly believe that the older generation have more to learn from us than we have to learn from them,” says Alvilde. “Today’s society is constantly changing and evolving and I think they have a harder time keeping up with that.”Balick agrees: “The speed at which social technologies change makes it a bit more difficult for older generations to understand the nature of the challenges of the younger ones because the generation gaps get smaller and smaller.”Pop, as it always has done, reflects society, and at the moment there’s a generational shift towards a youth culture raised in a prism of self-evaluation and self-recognition. “I wouldn’t say we’re lazy or don’t have potential, we’re just not channelling it correctly all the time,” states Cyrus. “We can do more than just social media. We can change the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47bb34509fa1068e936a4603c9f8cb440e554550/0_1316_6208_5299/master/6208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=25d32c58bf3d227962ad70ef31e67e9d 1240w","title":"olly alexander success is overwhelming people talk to you differently","story":"The Years \u0026amp Years frontman on fame, therapy and how Disneyland inspired himOlly Alexander, the frontman of the British band Years \u0026amp Years, has blood-red dyed hair. He wears a brass safety pin through one ear and sometimes grins so widely, so wildly, that the edges of his mouth seem to disappear around his narrow, fine-boned face. What soon draws the eye is a scar on his forehead. “I ran into a brick wall as a kid,” the 27-year-old says over lunch at a cafe in London. He touches the scar. “I was playing at being a Power Ranger. Ouch.”These days, Alexander plays at being a pop star – and on the surface, at least, it seems like a game that’s going well for him. With the launch of their first album in 2015, Years \u0026amp Years enjoyed a really remarkable few months. They were named BBC Sound of 2015 in January, promptly going to No 1 in the UK singles chart in March, and likewise topping the album chart in July. The band’s propulsive, 90s-nostalgic dance pop (like Disclosure or Clean Bandit, only up the randiness and add a little disco) caught on. And Alexander made a quick Meghan Markle-like ascent to something like pop royalty. “One of the most influential gay pop stars of this generation,” the Gay Times wrote. “All hail the King!”Years \u0026amp Years are a three-piece – also made up of keyboard and synth player Emre Türkmen and bassist Mikey Goldsworthy – but it has always been clear that Alexander is the band’s guiding force, their chief lyricist, a Gaga-like taker of risks when he performs and a political voice, off stage, who has an appealing, glitter-speckled sense of activism. A pithy and witty speaker on LGBTQ+ rights, Alexander has also opened up engagingly about his struggles with mental health. “A lifeline to troubled young people,” the Observer wrote of him, in 2016, around the same time that Years \u0026amp Years played at Glastonbury. There, Alexander wore an oversized choirboy smock strung front and back with rainbow-coloured ribbons – it was Pride weekend – and made a widely admired speech about battling prejudice. “Shove a rainbow in fear’s face,” was how he put it.Musicians must pray for debuts like this – to come over credible, commercial, with real-world clout. No brick walls clattered into, no obvious “Ouch” moments. Or were there?Years \u0026amp Years are almost done on their second album, due this summer, and from the demos I’ve heard the new music admits a brittleness and vulnerability in Alexander that wasn’t so obvious on the 2015 debut. He is still a fabulous and steely man when in pop-star mode (at the photoshoot, he prowls around in heels and a collared lace bodysuit that make him resemble a steampunk, space-bound Queen Elizabeth I), but he cuts a shyer and less certain figure at lunch.He arrived with a cigarette pushed behind his ear, and smoked it outside with quick, jittery puffs. Now he hunches over a salad, an elbows-in kind of eater and a nervous giggler. Of his pop-mode confidence, he says, “I wish I carried that around with me in my day-to-day life. But I don’t.” He’s wearing a pair of dungarees that he likes, he says, because they feel “like clothes that give you back a hug”.As Alexander eats, he talks about what happened in the aftermath of that famous Glastonbury performance, once he was out of public sight. The band had been cheered off, a career high. And once backstage, the musician recalls, he sat down and wept. Inconsolable, feeling lower than he’d been in months. “It happens,” he shrugs. “A falling off a cliff. The pendulum swings.”“When I was younger,” Alexander says, “I thought that if you were famous and successful, it would mean that you just felt happy all the time. That you would become, like, this mystical creature that people just adored. And so you would adore yourself.”Alexander doesn’t always make eye contact, and he addresses this next bit at the napkin dispenser between us.“Obviously I realise how ridiculous that sounds. But it wasn’t until our album got to No 1 that I realised I still believed in it. We’d basically won the lottery. I felt like I’d won the lottery. And at the same time I still felt like the same person I’d always been. And all the things that I associated with my depression, and my anxiety, those periods of feeling really low, they were still there. And I was so annoyed at myself. ”Alexander talks about first discovering the transformative, strengthening power of a good costume. It was on a trip to Disneyland, when he was nine. “The greatest experience of my life up to then,” Alexander says. “The pomp! The whole make-believe nature of that place. It was very powerful for me.People were all wearing costumes, playing characters. It was this other reality where fun things happened, more than they seemed to in real life. And I just remember wanting to be a part of something like that.”Theme parks were a big feature of his young life. Alexander grew up living next door to them, not one but three, first Alton Towers, then Blackpool Pleasure Beach, then Drayton Manor. His father helped launch and market new rides in these places, and the family moved wherever the work was.He was born in 1990, the younger of two sons. His mother ran community craft groups. His father, while employed in the theme parks, tended side dreams of being a professional musician. Of his father he says, cautiously: “Quite a difficult man... Definitely not happy within himself.”Alexander is more explicit about his own early troubles. “I used to have hallucinations and hear voices and stuff as a kid. Which sounds alarming, but it’s just the way it was.” Also: “I had what would now be called sleep paralysis, from six years old until maybe I was 16. Terrifying dreams.”His parents separated when Alexander was 13, a daunting and confusing period for him. “My dad had been very absent, even when he was there. Then he left the family and moved away. Our relationship, it feels to me, ended when I was 13.” With his mother and brother, Alexander relocated to a sleepy village in Gloucestershire called Coleford.Part of Alexander’s conversational charm is that he’ll veer between the frank and sober discussion of the self-doubt and difficulty he experienced as a young man, into brilliantly catty and droll little anecdotes about his upbringing. Here he is, describing his first paid employment – a Saturday job in a Coleford shop called Moonstones. “We sold incense, candles, spellbooks. Um, bongs. Chocolates shaped like penises. Everything you’d need really – a one-stop shop.”He wasn’t a popular teenager, and was bullied at his secondary school in Coleford just as he had been at his old primary schools. He marvels, thinking back, at his response to this. “I started wearing eyeliner to school. Nail varnish. Choker necklaces.” He put on a costume: a counter-intuitive form of self-defence. “I’d been bullied for years and all I wanted was for that to stop. But at the same time I had this sense that I was different, I was weird, and wearing makeup and crazy clothes was my way of trying to find an identity, in the face of people who were going to rip me apart anyway.”Half by accident, he embarked on a different artistic career first. At 16, Alexander auditioned for the Channel 4 drama Skins, and was in talks about a role. The job didn’t materialise until he was well into his 20s, when he was cast as a creepy student photographer, but meanwhile his agent put him up for other stuff. By the time he’d finished his A-levels and moved to London, he was getting varied work – in Gaspar Noé’s Enter The Void and Laura Wade’s The Riot Club and a corporate video for Google, playing a confused consumer who didn’t know how much he needed the advice of a really good search engine. Probably his peak as an actor came in 2012 when he was cast in a Michael Grandage production, Peter And Alice, alongside Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw.This West End run coincided, in Alexander’s breezy telling, with the busiest period in his romantic career. “Lot of sex.” He had known that he fancied boys from the age of about 10, though the concept of being gay was something only introduced to him via playground insult he can remember drawing stick figures in a geography textbook, bewildered, trying to figure out how two men could ever even manage it. These days, Alexander says, “my sexuality is part of my music, part of my identity”, but this was a clunky journey in its early phases and it wasn’t until he arrived in London and got into a first relationship, with the brother of a friend, that he felt he could properly come out to those closest to him.After that – whoosh. “I figured out that I could pull, basically. It wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be. I realised that, actually, everyone’s pretty horny, pretty desperate at times, and all you needed to do was maintain eye contact and be confident and that was kind of it.” Since then, he’s sampled romance in many of its forms, being single and shagging a lot, being single and not shagging so much, being in an open relationship, being in a celebrity relationship (with Clean Bandit’s Neil Amin-Smith), being in a quieter relationship with somebody unknown – that was the most recent, and it came to an end about 18 months ago. What has he learned? “That the longer you’re single, the more you notice how everyone else is in a relationship. But that’s a whole other thing.”He says he finds it harder to pull in clubs without the freedom of anonymity he used to enjoy. “I’m having much less sex than I did in my early 20s, for sure.” He’s tried the hook-up app Grindr, but the men he messaged with wouldn’t believe he was who he said he was. “So that didn’t go very well.” After years of living with flatmates, he recently moved to live on his own, in a flat in east London. “The last few months I’ve been wondering, ‘Will I just be alone, for ever? And would I be OK with that?’ I want to be OK with that.”Thinking of how ill-informed he felt as a kid, and of the anxiety he might have been spared had he only known more and known better, Alexander has resolved to be a public figure who is as vocal and open about his sexuality as he can be. As soon as he was asked, in an early-career interview for a blog, he said he was gay. (This was actually how his beloved grandmother found out: Alexander hadn’t yet got around to telling her.) Last year, he made a BBC Three documentary, Growing Up Gay, that is still on iPlayer and gets broadcast around the world. “I get messages about it at weird times of night.”Soon after our lunch, he’s due to give the keynote address at an annual Stonewall event. He hasn’t written his speech yet, and is still toying with points of view he might want to get across: that LGBT-inclusive sex education should be compulsory in schools that LGBT support groups need more government funding than ever “that yes, we can get married now, but that’s not the end of the story, that’s not gay rights done.” When the event does take place, Alexander will speak about how, as a young actor who went through media training, he was told it might be best not to speak about his sexuality at all. (“I ignored advice.”)Alexander made an interesting choice, in 2013, when major labels started showing an interest in Years \u0026amp Years. He entered therapy, specifically in anticipation of what a frontline music career might do to his fragile emotional state. Polydor were still six months from formally signing them.He knew fame was coming, though – that early?No, he says. But if there was a chance of the band making it, however slight, he reasoned he’d better be prepared. “And I’m grateful I made that decision. I’ve been seeing the same therapist through the whole process.” Through the band’s kick-starting anointment as the BBC Sound of 2015, then their smash No 1 single King that spring, then their No 1 album Communion that summer. “To go from zero to 100. To have an idea of what success is, your entire life, and then it happens to you. It’s overwhelming. There’s a lot of noise. And people start talking to you differently.”Alexander laughs, frowns – speaks at the napkins again. He starts talking about his dad, with whom Alexander went through an awkward episode after Years \u0026amp Years topped the charts. By then, father and son had no relationship to speak of, Alexander says. They hadn’t said a word to each other in seven years. “And, um, my dad started tweeting at me.”A pause. “It’s hard for me to talk about. It’s a hard issue, because it’s tied up with my family, and also his new family. I want to be respectful.”He doesn’t sound sure whether his father even knew whether what he was doing was public but anyway, he messaged him over Twitter, in full view of social media. “And it got really, really messy. There were some Years \u0026amp Years fans who started tweeting him back, trolling my dad. He was talking back to them. It was a real head-fuck.”However clumsy the timing and the method, was a part of Alexander gratified that he got in touch?“The best way I can describe it is that when me and my dad last knew each other, when I was 13 or 14, that’s frozen in time for me,” he says. And back then, he continues, he couldn’t have imagined any better future for himself than becoming a pop star and having his father want to be a part of his life again. “But then he did get in contact with me. And it was then I realised that what that 13-year-old wanted, that wasn’t actually possible. Not any more.”What did the 13-year-old want?“I realised that a part of me wanted to be successful in music because my dad wanted to be a musician. That a part of me thought, if I became a musician and I did well, he’d be proud of me. Or he’d, y’know, be so sorry for not being the dad I wanted him to be.”But that’s not how it felt?No, he says. When they did come together, Alexander noticed that, “I’d become something that my dad was sort of intimidated by. I’d been wanting to be successful, in part, because I wanted to prove something to him. And when that happened, I realised it didn’t feel good, it just felt like… like I’d tricked somebody.”Yeah, he says, his father was foremost in his thoughts when he wrote that one. But he’d been thinking, too, about past relationships, those various boyfriends he’d dumped or been dumped by. Alexander sees a clear thread running through it all, from parental to romantic difficulties. “I guess at its heart it’s just not really being able to trust someone who says they love you. If that’s something that’s ingrained in you, then I think it’s hard to get past that.”We’re finished with lunch. Having travelled deeper into his psyche than he expected to – “normally I would have these mental conversations alone with myself, in my flat” – Alexander starts to wonder about another cigarette, and pats the pockets of his dungarees. I tell him that, yeah, I can see why he might choose to wear clothes that feel like they hug. He smiles.Before we stand up and gather our things, he asks to add a couple of “bookends” to what’s been discussed. That he experienced a lot of love and support, growing up, from his mother and grandmother. (“I feel I have to say that: My mother loved me! She tried her best!”) And also that he’s profoundly grateful to music, to his band and their followers, to the rainbow smocks and lace bodysuits and the whole pop palaver, for the release-valve it has offered a troubled mind.“There’s a lot of quite raw emotion inside me,” Alexander tells me. “Obviously. And most of the time it can only come out in these tiny little cracks. One of those cracks – that’s the music.”Commenting on this piece?

Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59f4eff7ae24a736e8ef223ee3c7d3408b674e3/0_69_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a9ef779dc4df0c33a4491c17b7e83e45 1240w","title":"f1 teams proposal cheaper louder engines 2021","story":"Lewis Hamilton faces a huge challenge to close Sebastian Vettel’s early lead in the world championship standings after receiving a five-place grid penalty due to a gearbox change the team had to institute after a hydraulics leak at the first round in Australia.A software error cost Hamilton a probable win in Melbourne as the Ferrari driver established a seven-point advantage with victory. After the race Mercedes admitted the British driver suffered a hydraulics leak, adding that he was fortunate to finish the race, let alone in second place.It means Hamilton will start only sixth even if he manages to post the quickest time in qualifying on Saturday.Kimi Räikkönen topped the time sheets in second practice at Bahrain, the only session that takes place in the evening and thus most representative of race conditions, ahead of his team-mate Vettel, with Valtteri Bottas in third and Hamilton in fourth. Daniel Ricciardo in the Red Bull was quickest in the afternoon during FP1.Meanwhile proposals for the future of Formula One including a cost cap and louder engines were received with general approval when presented to the teams on Friday.The sport’s owner, Liberty Media, unveiled its five-point plan outlining its vision of F1 for 2021. However, its objectives remain broad and a considerable and potentially difficult period of negotiation remains.Liberty’s blueprint was a distillation of concepts that have previously been aired by Ross Brawn, F1’s sporting director. The key points include cheaper, louder and simpler engines, that will be more attractive to new manufacturers, and a cost cap, understood to have been set at $150m. The big teams currently spend an estimated $300m.It also contains a proposal for revenue distribution to be more balanced, based on performance, and including a recognition of historical franchises and value – a reference to additional payments to teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, above their share of performance revenue.There is also an intention to have cars better suited to race one another, making the driver the predominant factor and maintaining the unique design while standardising parts that are not relevant to fans.The proposals given to the teams are understood to have included more detail than was publicly released and are crucial to the future of the sport. Christian Horner, who has long been critical of the rules as they stand, was broadly optimistic.“The positive thing is they are focused on the fans,” he said. “On creating a better show, a more affordable F1. The big question is the devil in the detail. They have put big issues up but how is it going to be delivered?”Ferrari and Mercedes have previously expressed disquiet about the proposed changes with the former threatening to leave and the task now facing Liberty is reaching agreement with them.Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, believed it was a constructive starting point. “The positive of today is we know what their vision is,” he said. However, he was cautious about the proposed cost cap. “We need to work with Liberty and find a compromise, that number will not be achievable but we are all in the same financial reality.”“My priority is protecting our structure and our people. We have been here a long time and the same with Ferrari and Red Bull, so you need to ask how you can achieve a sustainable business model without having any hardship on anybody.”The teams below them on the grid, for whom this represents a chance to close what has become a vast gap to the top three, were unsurprisingly positive. Claire Williams, the Williams deputy team principal, was enthusiastic. “Everything they presented from revenue redistribution to cost cap is absolutely everything we want to see from 2021 and beyond,” she said. “I’m personally delighted at the proposals.”McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, concurred. “I think the direction they’re taking is the right direction,” he said. “The sport starts with the fan and that’s what Liberty are focused on. We all recognise the sport is not where it needs to be today, so it’s in our collective interest to improve the show.”Brawn has described the current regulations as a deterrent to new teams and his plans met with approval from Andy Palmer, the head of Aston Martin. “These prospective changes support many of the requirements needed for Aston Martin to enter the sport as an engine supplier. This is a very positive step in the right direction,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b36b30fa3200a735961618ea3afd1f6f08f134/0_386_3788_2272/master/3788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=90c692c81aefe813166af902e6050350 1240w","title":"tiger woods ian poulter masters","story":"Tiger Woods and Ian Poulter have history with capital H. When they form a rare two ball at Augusta National on Saturday, with hopes of Masters triumph having evaporated at equal time but with contrasting effect, the hope is they reflect on such jousts of old. Woods and Poulter, for different reasons, also contributed so much to the buildup to this major championship.Poulter infamously laid down his professional credentials in affirmative terms a decade ago. “The trouble is I don’t rate anyone else,” the Englishman said. “Don’t get me wrong, I really respect every professional golfer, but I know I haven’t played to my full potential and when that happens, it will be just me and Tiger.”The ridicule levelled at Poulter for the comment was unfair with regards to his revealing what makes him tick. The prospect of pursuing Woods – Poulter, remember was a five-handicap player more accustomed to selling chocolate bars than competing with leading amateurs when he turned professional – would provide deep motivation. It was just the Englishman’s style to make this\u0026nbsppublic.“If people do play well over a period of two years, you can get to No 2 You can’t reach Tiger,” Poulter later explained. “It would be a dream to see Tiger Woods and then me in the world rankings as you look down. What’s wrong with that? Is it being rude? Is it being disrespectful to everybody else? I don’t think so.”Woods might just have raised an eyebrow. He had plenty else to concern himself with at the time. Lee Westwood was known to have had great fun with Poulter’s claims he dubbed his compatriot “No 2”. Woods approved. He was later to slap his pretender down in public. “Poulter is always right, isn’t he?” said Woods, after Poulter predicted he wouldn’t finish in the top five of the 2011 Masters, when in fact the four-times Augusta champion tied for fourth.There’s more. In his book The Big Miss, a brilliantly chronicle of his time coaching Woods, Hank Haney reflects on the time Poulter shared Woods’s private jet back to Florida from a PGA Tour event. “Can you believe this dick mooched a ride on my plane?” read a Woods message to Haney. For all Poulter offers an entirely different version of events – he did precisely that via his own autobiography – and this pair haven’t exactly been professional foes in the manner Woods and Sergio García, for example, commonly were there has been sufficient needle.Now, Woods won’t like the reality of a scene where Poulter’s comeback actually – albeit only for now – outstrips his own. Poulter has clawed his way back from the position where his PGA Tour card was under serious threat to nail down a regular schedule, as achieved via second place in last year’s Players Championship. He has defied the odds by winning a Masters spot from the last chance saloon, winning the Houston Open in a play-off. The scale of Woods’s personal and injury turmoil emphasise the scale of his challenge in rising back to the top but the blunt reality is that Poulter is the one with a PGA Tour title to his name in 2018.Woods, understandably, calls for a glance towards the bigger picture. “Six months ago I didn’t know if I’d be playing golf,” the 14-times major champion said after making the cut. “Forget playing at the tour level, I didn’t know if I ever be playing again. But it’s incredible for have the opportunity again, to still come out here and play this golf course.“I know I’m on the weekend even though I’m a lot behind, if I play a special weekend, shoot two rounds in the mid 60s, you never know. My training has been good. The amount of cardio and amount of lifting we’ve done. I’ve kept my legs strong, I’ve kept my legs fit.”Of course, it isn’t Woods’s fault that external expectation surrounded the possibility of his making the greatest sporting comeback in history by claiming this Masters. The first major of 2018 is due the 42-year-old a debt of gratitude in respect of how\u0026nbspmuch he raised the tournament’s profile.\u0026nbspFor good or for bad, golf cannot get away from the magnetic pull of Woods.All reality suggests this remains only the formative stage of Woods’s return from the brink of retirement. He has played just a handful of rounds. For all his time-honoured specialism at Augusta National and certain other major venues, he surely needs to win a standard tour event before anything like the odds quoted pre-tournament for him to achieve Masters glory could be justified. In technical terms, Woods needs to prevent wild lashes that trigger wayward shots.Poulter is entitled to relish his Saturday scene. The closing 36 holes may well have been a bonus to the Ryder Cup talisman following the exertions of his Houston victory. It was his first stroke-play win in the United States, delivered in brilliantly exciting circumstances.“I was always going to be fatigued,” Poulter admitted. “I’m never going to be fresh, am I, coming into this week? I’m under-prepared – I got here Tuesday afternoon, I needed to have a day off from Monday – from a practice perspective, yeah, I’m under-practised, I didn’t get many holes in. I got 18 quick holes in.“I know this golf course, so there’s not really anything I needed to learn. The 10th green might be a fraction slower, the 12th green might be a fraction slower, because they’re the two newly laid greens. But apart from that the golf course is playing exactly the same.“There’s a couple of new pin positions. They’re clever in that way because just one yard out on some of the greens can give you a different break. You just have to be aware of that and you have to know your pins, you have to know your lines. That was a long-winded version yes, it’s hard.”Poulter and Woods now have more in common than ever before. Hopefully they have realised it. Both have scope to succeed in the back nine of their careers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87fd1917308ed2cc97cb95628578e90ce5402ef6/0_188_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9e0942806a3825584e0ead062307262 1240w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day three basketball cycling hockey and more live","story":"New Zealand’s Sam Webster takes race two and the gold medal, winning the second leg of the sprint final in a photo-finish despite a titanic effort by Scotland’s Jack Carlin to reel him in after giving the Kiwi several lengths going into the final lap. In the bronze medal final, Australia’s Jacob Schmid beat Malaysia’s Muhammad Shah Firdaus Sahrom. South Africa’s Tatjana Schoenmaker has just won the women’s 200m breaststroke at a canter, prevailing by a length from England’s Molly Renshaw and Chloe Tutton from Wales. That’s South Africa’s first ever gold medal in this event. Tutton’s bronze is Wales’s first medal in the pool at these Games. Chad Le Clos has just won the second semi-final of the Men’s 100m Freestyle, leading from pillar to post to finish ahead Australia’s Kyle Chalmers, Canada’s Yuri Kisil and Trinidad and Tobago’s Dylan Carter. In the first semi-final, Australia’s Cameron postest the fastest qualifying time of both semi-finals, taking 48.50 seconds to qualify along for the final alongside Scotland’s Duncan Scott, Australia’s Jack Cartwright and Sri Lanka’s Matthew Abeysinghe. New Zealand’s Sam Webster has prevailed in the first race of his best-of-three final against Scotland’s Jack Carlin. Webster had an average speed of 71.125km per hour, covering the 200m in a time of 10.123sec. Carlin was almost half a second behind. England’s Adam Peaty completed a four-year sweep of major titles with men’s 100 metres breaststroke gold at the Commonwealth Games. The 23-year-old Olympic, world and European champion defended the title he won at Glasgow 2014, clocking 58.84sec. James Wilby, the 200m breaststroke champion, took silver in 59.43sec. Scotland’s Duncan Scott earlier took 200m butterfly bronze as South Africa’s Chad Le Clos won a third straight title in his signature event.Peaty, who will return for the 50m breaststroke heats on Sunday, said: “I was out on world record pace at 50, but it’s April. I went out there tonight to get to that 50 as fast as I could and hold on. Even though it’s a gold medal and it’s four years undefeated and that’s completed the circle, I’m not happy with that performance. It’s not the best version of me. I want to go out there on the 50 and try to get that better version.”Elinor Barker won track cycling gold for Wales in the women’s points race at the Commonwealth Games as Katie Archibald and Neah Evans took silver and bronze respectively for Scotland.Barker, an Olympic team pursuit champion, had chosen not to take part in the pursuit races here and her fresher legs showed as she took a lap on the field midway through the race to vault to the top of the standings - a position she was then able to defend comfortably. Archibald followed up her gold in the inidual pursuit on Friday with a strong ride but could not match her Great Britain team-mate.Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott won gold for England in the women’s B\u0026ampVI 1000m time trial, breaking their own world record with a time of 1:04.623. That completed a remarkable double-double as they also won Thursday’s sprint in a world record time, having won both events at last month’s world championships with world records there too.Scotland pair Neil Fachie and Matt Rotherham picked up their second gold of the Games in the men’s B\u0026ampVI sprint, beating James Ball and Peter Mitchell of Wales after breaking the world record in qualifying.In the velodrome, we have the Women’s 500m Time Trial final, the Men’s Sprint finals and the Men’s 15km Scratch Race final. In the aquatics centre, there are also several more medals to be decided. Stay tuned for the Women’s 200m Breaststroke final, the Men’s SB8 100m Breaststroke final, the Women’s SM10 200m Inidual Medley final and the Women’s 4x200m Freestyle Relay final. Elinor Barker wins gold for Wales after gaining a lap on the field, before winning double points with a huge effort in the final sprint. That’s Wales’s second gold medal at these Games. Kate Archibald came second for Scotland, while her compatriot Neah Evans was third. Track cycling’s equivalent of the Wacky Races, the Women’s 25km Points Race, is currently being contested by a field of 24 riders. There are British riders from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with Scotland’s Katie Archibald and Welsh riders Elinor Barker and Dani Rowe (nee King) among theAdam Peaty wins the gold, while his compatriot James Wilby gets silver thanks to a mightily powerful surge in the final 25 metres. South Africa’s Cameron Van Der Burgh had looked like he might reel in Peaty, but ultimately had to settle for the bronze medal. Peaty’s winning time: 58.84, a new Commonwealth Games record.England’s Adam Peaty, who was afraid of water as a child, is the hot favourite to win this as defending champion, Olympic Champion, European Champion and World Champion. His world record is 57.13sec and he’s so determined to become the first swimmer in history to go under 57 seconds that he’s labelled his effort Project 56. Can he do it here? Australia’s Cate Campbell wins the gold medal, while her sister Bronte ties for silver with Canada’s Taylor Ruck. There was a suggestion Bronte Campbell had twitched on the starting block, but the result is confirmed. Cate Campbell wins in a time of 23.78sec, a new Commonwealth Games record. She had been hoping to beat Swedish swimmer Sarah Sjostrum’s world record of 23.67sec, but has come up short.Chad Le Clos ties up a bit towards the end, but holds on for the win to take his third consecutive Commonwealth title in this event in a time of 1min 54.00sec. Australia’s David Morgan was second in 1min 56.36sec and Scotland’s Duncan Scott was third in 1min 56.60sec. The evening’s swimming is about to begin with the Men’s 200m Butterfly Final. South Africa’s Chad Le Clos is the favourite in lane six. Jacob Peter’s is England’s representative in lane one, while Scotland’s Duncan Scott is in lane three. Le Close gets off to a mighty start and opens a huge lead. Australian world champion Matthew Glaetzer, who won the men’s keirin yesterday and was hot favourite to win the men’s sprint gold at the Commonwealth Games, went out of the race in the qualifying stages against Malaysian unknown and rank outsider Muhammad Sahrom.Sahrom was the slowest of the 16 qualifiers, but caught Glaetzer napping to eliminate him at the 18th final stages. “I was just coming into the bell too slow. I needed to be accelerating not just controlling,” said Glaetzer, a 25-year-old from Adelaide who seemed to be attempting to conserve energy. “It’s just hard, it’s a nightmare unfolding. With three-quarters of the lap to go, I knew I had stuffed it and had to give it all. I had to try and fight but the race was gone by then.” Sophie Thornhill and her pilot Helen Scott have won the Women’s B\u0026ampVI 1000m time-trial final, beating Australia’s Jessica Gallagher (with Madison Janssen) into second place. Scotland’s Aileen McGlynn (with Louise Haston) was third. Having already prevailed in the first, Scotland’s Neil Fachie and his tandem pilot Matt Rotherham have won the second race of their best of three competition against Welsh rider James Ball and his pilot Peter Mitchell in the Men’s Blind and Visually Impaired Sprint finals. Ellie Black scores 13.450, which is enough to win her the gold medal for Canada. Australia’s Georgia Godwin takes silver and England’s Alice Kinsella gets the bronze. The competition leader, Elisabeth Black from Canada, finishes her floor routine to rapturous applause and looks to have done enough to secure the gold medal. The judges will decide ... One of just a handful competitors left to compete in the final rotation, England’s Alice Kinsella completes her floor routine. It’s not perfect and she makes a few minor errors. The judges award her 12.55, which moves her ahead of Australia’s Georgia-Rose Brown into the silver medal position. Kinsella already has a silver to her name at these Games, having been part of the English women’s outfit that came second in the team event yesterday. Welsh gymnast Latalia Bevan follows Godwin and gets a score of 13.300 that moves her into second place. Her compatriot Maisie Methuen next out on the floor. Her routine earns her a score of 12.750 from the judges, which puts her in the bronze medal position. She’s unlikely to stay there, unfortunately. Australia’s Georgia Godwin has just posted the score to beat with a fine floor routine that leaves the crowd whooping with jubiliation, her coach beaming and the gymnast herself with a final score of 53.800. She’ll take some catching. The evening’s cycling action has just begun and the first of three possible races in the Men’s Blind and Visually Impaired Sprint Final is under way. Neil Fachie and Matt Rotherham are in action on their tandem against Welsh duo James Ball and Pete Mitchell and take the first race. The next one is scheduled for about 20 minutes time. Should Fachie and Rotherham win, expect to see their trademark, extremely foolhardy double “look ma, no hands” celebration. The competition continues and after three of the four rotations Canada’s Elisabeth Black is in the gold medal position. Australia’s Georgia Godwin is in second place, while England’s Alice Kinsella is third. A fall of the beam has just knocked England’s Kelly Simm out of the medal positions down to sixth.Zoe Smith overcame a crippling back injury and combining training with working in a bubble tea cafe and studying for her A-Levels to claim a third Commonwealth Games weightlifting medal.England’s Smith finished with silver with a combined weight of 207kg as Canada’s Maude Charron won gold in the women’s 63kg class with 220kg. The Londoner defied UK Sport’s funding cut of weightlifting and a back injury which required an epidural and left her fearful she would be unable to lift the 15kg bar to add to her Commonwealth collection.“It was awful the flight here was horrendous,” said Smith, who won Delhi 2010 bronze, aged 16, and Glasgow 2014 gold. “Even on the bus here I was thinking to myself I’m going to go and say hello to everyone and have a wave on the platform but I probably won’t be putting any weight on the bar.” Smith prioritised weightlifting over studying around the London 2012 Olympics, missed Rio 2016 with a shoulder injury and the funding cut has resulted in life changes. She has been working 10 hours a week at Pearls Bubble Tea in Loughborough University’s student union and studying for her A-Levels at Loughborough College at the age of 23. She has exams in biology, psychology and environmental science when she returns and plans to continue on to Birmingham 2022, via the Tokyo Olympics, despite recent travails. “I probably need to go and open a book and prepare for those exams,” she added. “I’ve been out here a couple of weeks and only glanced over them. So keep your fingers crossed for me in May. Funding isn’t why I do this. It’s always been about my love of weightlifting. I’m going to carry on doing that with funding or not.”Earlier Smith’s England team-mate Jack Oliver won a Commonwealth medal at the third attempt, with silver in the men’s 77kg class. PA SportMalaysia’s Farah Ann Abdul Hadi has just finished her floor routine. A Muslim gymnast, Hadi won six medals, including gold in the women’s floor exercise, in the 2015 Southeast Asia Games, only to be criticised by clerics in her homeland for wearing a leotard that showed off her “aurat” - an Islamic word meaning the shape of her genitals and thighs, which religious texts suggest should be covered. While India and Pakistan drew 2-2 in the big hockey match of the day, there were defeats for Wales and Scotland. In Pool B with India and Pakistan, Wales were beaten 3-0 by Malaysia. Canada won by the only goal of the game in their Pool A match against Scotland. After two rotations, Canada’s Elisabeth Black leads the field with a score of 27.900. England’s Kelly Simm is in second place with 27.750, while Georgia Godwin is in the bronze medal position. Latalia Bevan (Wales), Shannon Archer (Scotland) and Cara Kennedy (Scotland) are in fourth fifth and sixth place. Nile Wilson and James Hall made it a one-two for England in the men’s inidual all-around final at the Coomera Indoor Sports Centre, with Marios Georgiou from Cyprus finishing third. The women’s inidual all-around final is ongoing, with Nicole Burns from the Isle of Man gadding about on the beam as as I type. Weightlifting: Despite carrying an injury, English weightlifter Zoe Smith has finished second in the women’s 63kg, behind Canada’s Maude Charron. South African lifter Mona Pretorius has come third. Smith has now completed the set of Commonwealth Games medals, adding silver to the bronze she won as a 16-year-old in Delhi and the gold she won in Glasgow four years ago.There are 14 different sports being contested at the Commonwealth Games today, from cycling, swimming and boxing, to rather more niche pursuits such as lawn bowls and beach volleyball.Today’s medal events – some of which have already been contested – are in cycling, swimming, gymnastics, triathlon and weightlifting and Australia will be hoping to continue yesterday’s astonishing dominance in the pool, although England’s Adam Peaty is the hot favourite to win the men’s 100m breaststroke. THere’s already been one massive upset in the velodrome, where Aussie world champion Matthew Glaetzer is out of the men’s sprint. Despite setting a new world record in the heats, Glaetzer lost to Malaysia’s Muhammad Sahrom in the 18 finals. That’s all from me for now. To the disappointment of nobody, it’s over to the people’s champion, Barry Glendenning.Just a reminder for what to keep an eye out for this evening on the Gold Coast.An Aboriginal group marched through the centre of Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast on Saturday, continuing their protest against the hosting of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.Scenes! Pakistan come back from 2-0 down to draw level with India at 2-2. Wow! After watching Smith and Pretorius duke it out for silver and bronze Maude Charron strolls out and lifts 117kg over her head like it’s a twiglet to claim as dominant a gold medal as you could wish to see. Seriously impressive from the Canadian. Now, can she go on to break any records? She’s attempting 122kg to set a new Commonwealth Games clean-and-jerk record and equal the combined record of 220kg. YES! At her second attempt, the final lift of the event, Charron adds the cherry to the top of the cake.YES! Superb lift from Zoe Smith to lead the women’s 63kg weightlifting before Maude Charron takes to the stage. Guaranteed a least a silver for England. Credit to Pretorius for a superb battle. Bosh! Pretorius has just smashed a personal best 115kg in her final lift for a pure six out of six for the event. Can Smith match her?The women’s 63kg weightlifting final is now a three-way contest. Maude Charron is yet to attempt a clean-and-jerk but she is in pole position for gold. Behind her South Africa’s Mona Pretorius (203kg) and England’s Zoe Smith (204kg) are in a ding-dong for silver. This is a great contest. We’re nearing the business end of the women’s 63kg weightlifting final. Northern Ireland’s Emma McQuaid is in front on 182kg but the four leading lifters from the snatch component have yet to attempt the clean-and-jerk. We’ve been enjoying quarterfinals in the team table tennis today with India and England joining Australia and Singapore in the final four of the women’s event. In the men’s only two quarters have taken place so far with India thrashing Malaysia and Singapore scraping past Canada. Some swimming news coming through. England’s James Guy has withdrawn from tonight’s 200m butterfly final. The decorated 22-year old is being treated for dehydration but should be fit to compete later in the meet. Canada’s Maude Charron is leading the women’s 63kg weightlifting final at the halfway stage. The world championship silver medalist snatched 98kg to lead England’s Zoe Smith (92kg) and South Africa’s Mona Pretorious (91kg). Only six lifters snatched over 80kg. The field has been reduced from 13 to 12 ahead of the clean-and-jerk phase because Australian veteran Seen Lee failed to register a weight.India vs. Pakistan is a contest that matters whatever the sport and it’s on again in Pool B of the men’s hockey. India lead 2-0 in the second period. The next gold medal on offer is in the weightlifting. We’re approaching halfway in the women’s 63kg final. Drama in the cycling! Australia’s Matthew Glaetzer is out of the men’s sprint in a barely believable upset. Glaetzer, word champion in this event, set a new world record in the heats but contrived to lose to Malaysia’s Muhammad Sahrom in the 18 finals. England benefited from Australia’s poor fortune to secure both available gold medals during the inaugural Commonwealth Games PTWC Triathlon.Joe Townsend finished first in the men’s race, helped in no small part by five-time world champion Bill Chaffey suffering a nasty crash midway through the race.In the women’s race Jade Jones took advantage of Lauren Parker’s technical issues to become the event’s first female gold medalist. 25-year old Sathish Kumar Sivalingam defended the 77kg weightlifting gold medal he won in Glasgow, lifting 317 kg in total, 144 kg in snatch and 173 kg in Clean-and-Jerk. This was India’s third weightlifting gold of the games, following the pair already secured by Sanjita Chanu Khumukcham.Let’s catch up on the medals already handed out today.The English gymnastics team is a tight bunch and it showed again today with Nile Wilson pipping teammate James Hall to the All-Around Inidual gold medal. Hall was leading heading into Wilson’s final attempt on the horizontal bar, but still cheered his teammate on from the edge of the arena.“That was one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had,” Wilson said afterwards. “It was a battle on the high bar. You can’t write it, to finish the way like it did. That was one of the best high bars I have put together.”Wilson and Hall had already combined for gold in the men’s team final on Thursday.Gold for Australia! Jacob Birtwhistle completes the job for Australia, crossing the line with a boxing kangaroo flag in hand. Birtwhistle is joined in a four-way embrace by teammates Ashleigh Gardner, Matt Hauser and Gillian Backhouse. Gardner in particular deserves enormous credit for her third leg that decided this race.New Zealand are a long way behind in the bronze medal position, a few seconds ahead of Canada. Jacob Birtwhistle is cruising out in front of the mixed teams triathlon. He steps off his bike and into his running shoes with a 25-second lead over Alistair Brownlee. The 1.5k run is Birtwhistle’s strongest leg so Brownlee, the dual Olympic gold medalist, would have to do something miraculous to make up the time. The mixed team triathlon is dominating attention at the moment. It is a head-to-head battle between England and Australia approaching the final leg. To recap: teams are comprised of four triathletes - two male, two female - with each completing a 250m swim, a 7km cycle and a 1500m run.England’s line-up contains both Brownlee brothers but they may have to settle for silver because on the third leg Ashleigh Gentle of Australia has turned a minor deficit into an enormous lead over England’s Jess Learmonth, who rolled her ankle transitioning from the bike to the run.Hi there! Welcome to day three.Australia continued its domination of Gold Coast 2018 yesterday as the action remained centred on the pool and the velodrome. Of the 17 gold medals awarded eight went to the hosts. Three locals now have multiple golds. There were stories to celebrate elsewhere, including student cycling star Charlie Tanfield, and the City of Derby swimming club. There’s plenty of action to get to today, including the distribution of 22 gold medals, so let’s e straight in.England have started strongly, taking out gold and silver in the Men’s Inidual All-Around Gymnastics final, adding to golds in both the men’s and women’s PTWC Triathlon. India collected its third weightlifting gold. Here’s what’s still to come on day three. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.As always, if you would like to join in the conversation, please send emails to: jonathan.howcroft.freelance@guardian.co.uk or tweet me @JPHowcroft.

Picturesque fortified villages, such as Beynac, La Roque Gageac and Eymet (site of an unexpected pre-Brexit boom for UK settlers), and charming towns such as Bergerac, Brantôme, Bourdeilles and Ribérac, have long been popular with Brits wanting to settle in France, and this is one part of the country where they have always been warmly welcomed into local communities.Sarlat-la-Canéda is the perfect base for exploring the grandiose hilltop châteaux that look down on the Dordogne river and the Unesco-listed prehistoric sites along the Vézère valley. Its narrow streets are lined with lavish sandstone mansions, perfectly preserved since the middle ages and Renaissance. Don’t miss taking a ride up the 14th-century bell tower, where renowned architect and Sarlat local Jean Nouvel has designed a panoramic glass lift offering 360-degree views.Each of the Dordogne’s landmark castles has something different to discover. The immense Château de Castelnaud (€10.80) is perfect for kids, with its remarkable collection of medieval armaments, while the equally majestic Château de Beynac (€8), above a stone village that tumbles down to the river, was a location for Luc Besson’s 1999 Joan of Arc movie. The ornate, chocolate-box Château des Milandes used to belong to dancer and activist Josephine Baker, and houses an incredible museum about her life. In a tranquil valley is the breathtaking Château de Commarque (€8.50), a towering mass of ruins above ancient cave dwellings.Garden-lovers should leave time for two of France’s most famous formal gardens. The Jardins Suspendus at Marqueyssac (€9.80) are a magical maze of 150,000 swirling, looping box hedges, while those at the Manoir d’Eyrignac (€12.50) are more English in style, including an extravagant perfumed rose garden.The Dordogne’s incredible prehistoric sites are principally along the Vézère river. Kick off at Les Eyzies, spectacularly hewn into the cliffside, with a tour of the Prehistoric Museum (€6€4.50 ). On the other side of the river from Les Eyzies, a rickety staircase disappears into the Grotte du Grand Roc (€8.20), a vast cavern filled with stalactites and stalagmites, while La Roque Saint-Christophe (€8.75) is a kitsch but fascinating reconstitution of a kilometre-long cave village cut high into a cliff, inhabited 55,000 years ago by Neanderthals.Nothing quite prepares for a visit to Lascaux (€16), especially since the recent opening of a new £50m centre complete with futuristic multimedia special effects and interactive iPad guides. This is the second recreation of these caves and their 600 prehistoric wall paintings. The original site, discovered in 1940, closed to the public in 1963 to protect the fragile Cro Magnon artwork known as the “Sistine chapel of prehistory”. The new Lascaux is attracting huge crowds, with tour groups leaving every six minutes, so consider visiting the quieter, original Lascaux II complex (€12), which is frankly just as impressive a recreation of the original caves.Sarlat is the undisputed foodie capital of the Dordogne, with tempting, affordable restaurants serving regional specialities such as succulent duck magret and confit, and omelettes bursting with girolle mushrooms. It’s difficult to beat the honest home cooking at Le Bistrot, which does a two-course €14 set lunch or €14-€18 main dishes in the evening, when diners sit out opposite buskers, clowns and acrobats performing outside the towering gothic cathedral.Sarlat is surrounded by great-value traditional fermes auberges (farm inns). At La Table du Chaffour, Nicole and Jean-Marie Verlhiac grow vegetables, raise ducks and geese, and use only their own produce for the hearty three-course €15 menu tradition or the six-dish €29 menu gastronomique.In the hills above Château Montfort is the no-frills Pech de Malet hotel, whose sunny terrace has awe-inspiring vistas over the Dordogne valley, perfect for a sunset aperitif, with house wine at €6.50 a bottle, accompanied by a €6.80 plate of irresistible pommes sarladaises, thinly sliced potatoes sautéed with garlic, parsley and cep mushrooms.Restaurants around the caves of Les Eyzies tend to be aimed mostly at tourists, but just outside the village, talented chef Pascal Lombard has opened the casual Bistrot Les Glycines. Working from an open kitchen, Pascal’s young team prepare a €17 three-course lunch menu with creative dishes such as salmon rillettes topped with edible flowers and root vegetables, and grilled duck hearts.A tour of Lascaux takes around half a day, and rather than looking for food in the nearby villager of Montigny, visitors can choose between the brasserie, snacking and cafe options at the centre’s excellent Cafe Lascaux, with prices ranging from a €9 salad to the €15.90 set lunch.You can’t get more central in Sarlat than the main square above the town’s most popular cafe, Le Glacier (€90 B\u0026ampB). The four bedrooms are enormous, with double glazing so you are not kept awake by the late-night crowds drinking below. The idyllic landscapes around the castles and caves of the Dordogne and Vézère rivers offer dozens of chambre d’hôtes (B\u0026ampBs), catering to all budgets.To splash out for a night in a romantic setting, two addresses stand out: the monumental 13th-century Château de Puymartin (doubles from €150 B\u0026ampB) has two stately rooms with antique furniture, while the more ornate Château de Monrecour (doubles from €120 room-only) has recently become a 10-room hotel, with hot-air balloons taking off from the gardens from time to time.On the road to Lascaux are two very different B\u0026ampBs: the chic Maison de Marquay (doubles from €90 B\u0026ampB) in the middle of a tiny village, where owner Gérard Lerchundi prepares a gourmet €33 dinner each night and the rustic Pech Mortier (€55 B\u0026ampB), in the countryside by Marcillac-Saint-Quentin.A few miles from Lascaux is Condat-sur-Vézère, where sumptuous 13th-century L’Hostellerie de la Commanderie (doubles €110), is in beautiful wooded gardens with swimming pool and a breakfast room decorated with glittering candelabras.• More B\u0026ampBs at sarlat-tourisme.comBergerac comes to life on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, when its narrow medieval streets are taken over by a market. Stock up for a picnic in the surrounding vineyards with organic tomatoes, saucisson packed with hazelnuts and fragrant strawberries. Bergerac is at the heart of affordable and welcoming wine country. It’s easy to follow a Route des Vins around the rolling vine-clad hills, discovering little-known reds such as Pécharmant and the luscious Monbazillac dessert wine.Enoy your picnic in the gardens of the Renaissance Château de Monbazillac but skip its touristy tasting sessions and head instead to the equally imposing Château de Bélingard to try its fruity €5.90 Bergerac Blanc. You may well bump into the estate’s garrulous owner, Laurent, Comte de Bosredon, who will tell you how wine has been made here since the days of the Celts.Halfway between Bergerac and Périgueux, take a side trip to Domaine de Neuvic, a fish farm with a difference as it harvests sturgeon eggs to produce caviar. For €19, visitors get a tour of the farm and see some seriously enormous sturgeons, plus a spoonful of caviar and a glass of bubbly. Périgueux is the capital of the Dordogne and is dominated by the swirling domes and turrets of its white Saint Front cathedral. Inspired by St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, the present building looks similar to the Sacre-Coeur in Paris – not surprising because it was restyled in the 19th century by the same architect.The same distinctive white stone is even more conspicuous in another of the Dordogne’s jewels, medieval Brantôme, almost entirely encircled by a meander of the Dronne river. Brantôme’s massive Benedictine abbey was founded in AD769 by the emperor Charlemagne, and behind it are some much older troglodyte caves, with haunting religious wall carvings.Hire a kayak (€10) or paddleboard (€12) (brantomecanoe.com) for a couple of hours to do a lazy tour of the city or take the whole day and paddle seven kilometres upriver to Bourdeilles, where a fortified chateau (€8.70) houses an enormous collection of antique furniture and tapestries.In Monbazillac, the welcoming Maison Vari is owned by a local vigneron (wine maker). Château Vari wines can be tasted for free at the bar, or there are tables in the garden of this friendly cafe-wine bar for indulging in generous €10 plates of charcuterie and local cheeses with a chilled bottle of organic €12 Bergerac blanc or rosé.In Périgueux, head straight for the town’s historic covered market on Place du Coderc. It was already a foodie paradise but now it boasts the Bistrot de la Halle, a minuscule diner where a glass of wine is the perfect accompaniment to freshly shucked oysters or a hamburger au foie gras.Brantôme caters for all budgets, from the Michelin-starred Moulin de l’Abbaye, to the cheap-and-cheerful Co’Thé-Café , where a homemade soup, quiche and salad costs €7.50. Alternatively, sit out on the river bank at Comme à la Maison (13 quai Bertin, +33 9 8051 6833, no website), where owner Sarah Nicolas serves a €16 three-course lunch with seasonal, organic products.There are numerous winemaker B\u0026ampBs dotted across the Bergerac area, with an especially warm welcome at Domaine du Boyer (doubles from €66 B\u0026ampB). Yannick Dumonteil and his Vietnamese wife, Ghislaine, make guests feel they’re part of the family and run cellar tours with tastings of their wines – and there’s a family swimming pool surrounded by vines.Rather than looking for a place to stay in busy Périgueux, carry on to Brantôme, where Sandrine Laby has a cosy four-room B\u0026ampB, Au Nid des Thés (€90 B\u0026ampB), right above her salon de thé, with a sunny roof terrace for breakfast, where she serves home-baked cakes and a choice of 30 teas.Take the lovely 10km drive south-west along the Dronne to medieval Bourdeilles, crossing an ancient stone bridge to enter the village. Here, the venerable Hostellerie les Griffons (doubles from €95, breakfast €13) sits right on the river. Old-fashioned but charming, this 16th-century auberge has 10 rustic-beamed rooms, as well as a small pool.For a more outdoorsy experience, carry on to the north of the Dordogne, where Parenthèses Imaginaires (cabins sleeping 2, from €110 a night, minimum two nights) is a sprawling campsite with a lake and thick forest. Dynamic young owner Francoise has created an eco-glamping resort, with romantic lakeside wooden chalets and areas for tents and vehicles (pitches from €20 for two nights).Ryanair flies to Bergerac from Liverpool, Stansted and East Midlands Flybe flies from Birmingham, Southampton, Exeter and Edinburgh.

Additionally, it did work for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump, and the US senators Thom Tillis and Ted Cruz.The Observer first revealed links between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ last May. Two weeks ago, Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told how he had helped set up the company when he asked friends in his home town of Victoria, British Columbia, to come and work with Cambridge Analytica. AIQ has denied Wylie had any involvement in setting up the company.At that time, AIQ removed a quote from Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s chief strategist, from the home page of its website. Previously, it had said: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.”Ten days ago, Wylie gave evidence about AIQ to British MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee and also handed over legal documents that showed the connections between it and SCL Elections, including two contracts and an IP licence as well as an email between Jeff Silvester, the cofounder of AIQ, and Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.The email, about the campaign for Bolton, referenced Aleksandr Kogan and the Facebook data he had harvested on behalf of Cambridge Analytica.Last week, AIQ told the Observer it was not a direct part andor the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica, and that it had not been involved the exploitation of Facebook data.The company is already intertwined in an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which in November reopened an investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave had given its youth campaign, BeLeave, saying there were “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”.It is perfectly legal for one campaign to donate to another if they are separate, but the donation went straight from Vote Leave to AIQ, and a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, a 22-year-old volunteer with BeLeave, told the Observer they had no control over how the money was spent. Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant to electoral law. When the commission first looked at this in March 2017 it agreed with Vote Leave. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is leading another investigation into the use of data in the referendum, said: “AggregateIQ has not been especially cooperative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.” AIQ says it has answered all the questions put to it by the commission.Both Cummings and Darren Grimes, of BeLeave, told the paper they found the firm – which has just 20 staff operating out of a cramped office above an opticians in Victoria, 4,760 miles away – “on the internet”.However cached searches show AggregateIQ did not show up in Google searches at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms. AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.Silvester said Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.”AIQ has yet to release a statement in relation to the suspension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1346990cc0ab6eb76bf22ac7b027a12c09189c75/0_0_4005_2403/master/4005.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=30fc395b07ac3fca531633998047ecef 1240w","title":"reunited after 24 years rare happy ending for chinas broken families","story":"The story of Kang Ying, and the parents who searched 24 years for her, moved the countryGrowing up, Kang Ying didn’t think much about the fact that she was adopted. Her family, farmers in a rural county of China’s south-western Sichuan province, never treated her differently. When Kang asked about her birth parents, she was told she had been found on the street, a little girl no more than four years old, probably abandoned.In March, Kang, now 28, learned that was not the whole story. Married and with children of her own, she began to wonder about her own mother. She searched online for “child lost more than 20 years ago” and came across a sketch that made her stop. The drawing had been posted by a couple in Chengdu, about 100 miles from where she grew up, who had been searching for their daughter for the last 24 years. The father, a taxi driver, had been handing out cards about his missing daughter to all of his passengers. The online ad was their latest effort.She called the contact listed and, less than a month later, flew to Chengdu to meet her birth parents. The family met for the first time on Tuesday in an emotional reunion that captured the public imagination, a rare happy ending for one of the thousands of Chinese families who have lost a child.On Friday, Kang was visiting her parents again to celebrate their reunion in her father’s village, two hours from Chengdu where they normally live. Her mother washed dishes and prepared food in a dark kitchen at the back of the family home. Kang took her children to play outside. “I thought it would be awkward meeting them after so much time, but it felt natural. I guess it’s because we are family,” Kang said.In China, anywhere between 50,000 and 200,000 children go missing every year, according to estimates. In most cases the children have been abandoned, the result of multiple factors: rural poverty, China’s formerly stringent one-child policy, a preference for sons and larger families, and local traditions.But many have also been kidnapped, to be sold within the country as couples struggle with rising infertility rates and imbalances caused by population controls. Boys fetch higher prices, but according to Anqi Shen, a professor at Northumbria Law School in Newcastle who researched trafficking, girls are also in demand because of the belief they will take care of ageing parents.“What we can say is that child trafficking and abduction was a historical social problem in China, and it remains a serious problem,” she said.Kang’s parents, Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying, were selling bananas at a market in Chengdu in 1994 when Kang, whom they had named Qifeng and called Fengwazi, or “Feng baby”, went missing. Liu sent her husband to get change for a customer. When he returned, Kang had disappeared. They ran through the market shouting her name but she was gone. She was three years old. Liu sank into a depression, refusing to work, sleep or eat. Her husband cycled the streets of Chengdu calling his daughter’s name. Eventually they went back to work. They had two other children.But they never quite let it go. Wang subscribed to a newspaper hoping for news of Kang. In 2015, he began driving for the taxi-hailing app Didi and had hundreds of cards printed with information about their missing daughter. They did not have a photograph of Kang so they used a picture of her sister. Every time the phone rang, Liu would jump, thinking it might be Kang. Eventually, news of Wang’s efforts went viral and a police sketch artist volunteered to do the drawing that caught Kang’s attention. When Kang called them in March, the three of them spoke over video on WeChat. Wang and Liu had spoken to 30 other women they thought might be Kang but this time felt different.“When we saw her I had this feeling of being a mother that I never felt with any of the others. I knew for sure she was my daughter,” Liu said.They started to talk over the phone every day, and decided Kang should do a DNA test. When she became anxious about how long it would take, Wang told his daughter: “We’ve been waiting for this for years. It’s OK if we wait a few days more.”China has criminalised the buying of children, punishable with three years in prison, and established a national DNA database for searching families. Still, the problem persists. On the website, Baobeihuijia, or Baby Come Home, more than 41,000 sets of parents are looking for lost children. On 1 April, Kang got a call from the police telling her she should book a flight to Chengdu. Her DNA matched. Two days later, Kang made the journey with her husband and two children. They were swarmed by a horde of reporters and television crews.“I’d never seen so many people. My mind went empty,” she said. In the crowd she saw her mother holding a sign: “Child, welcome home.” Kang went back to her parent’s home in Chengdu, where they stayed up until the early hours of the morning. “I don’t remember what we talked about. We just didn’t stop talking,” she said.The next day, Kang’s father wanted to take her to his village, two hours from Chengdu, where his family has lived for generations. Relatives and friends came, filling 20 dining tables set out in the yard. Kang’s father parked at the village gate and insisted on carrying her on his back the rest of the way. He told her how much his parents, now dead, had prayed that she would be found. “Now I can finally tell my mom I’ve brought our Fengwazi back,” he said.Kang, who lives in China’s northern Jilin province, more than 1,500 miles from Chengdu, still talks with her birth parents most days. They understand that she has a separate life and her own family. On Thursday on Tomb Sweeping Day, a holiday for families to honour their ancestors, Wang drove them three hours to where Kang’s adoptive father and grandparents are buried. Kang watched as her parents knelt and kowtowed at their graves. They thanked them for raising their daughter and said they were sorry they had not.“At that moment, I really felt like crying. I don’t want my parents to feel regretful. It’s not their fault,” Kang said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba01dc9382ba2540098ba321563d569700dcb06/0_301_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=19c064abf7386dc5b9f1de3f3bc0ed82 1240w","title":"are you getting the most from your savings","story":"Save cash and get more money – for free. It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing. Anyone prepared to take a bit more risk can opt for a stocks and shares Lifetime Isa. If the stock market goes up, this could provide better returns than a simple cash Lifetime Isa, but you can lose money too. Stocks and shares Lifetime Isas are better suited to longer-term investments, of at least 5 years, so that any dips in the market are balanced out.Whichever you choose, you will have to plan a little in advance – you’ll need to have an account for a year before you can use it to buy a home.Got all that? If so, take the quiz to see if you understand Lisas.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily. OneFamily does not provide financial advice.
