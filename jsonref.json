You were putting an appeal in to get her prosecuted, you never bothered to see her.\u0027If it had been... an ordinary person, you wouldn\u0027t have prosecuted.\u0027I see domestic abuse and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself so there is nothing we can do to bring Caroline back. I hope in hindsight you do regret this. This girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.\u0027Earlier in the hearing DI Batemen had insisted she had not treated the presenter any differently because she was famous and would not change her decisions.She said a caution was not appropriate because Flack did not admit her guilt in a police interview, although she had said \u0027I hit him, he was cheating on me\u0027 at the scene.Mr Daw, the author of Justice on Trial, said she should have been given the chance to agree to the lesser police action.He said: \u0027What should have happened here is that she should have been offered a caution, in the cold light of day I strongly expect from experience, had she been offered one her lawyers would have advised her to accept it and in all probability she would have done.\u0027The CPS came to the view that a caution was appropriate, yet the police were adamant for reasons I don\u0027t understand that there had to be a criminal prosecution.\u0027It seems to me that the system failed on a number of levels. It failed because there appears to have been undue influence by two factors, her high profile and therefore there\u0027s a desire not be seen to be going soft on someone who is in the public eye and risking adverse public comment – that was a factor undoubtedly in this case.\u0027This is not a case where there was evidence where the victim was under coercion or so vulnerable he was incapable of making a decision on what was best for him – and there are such cases, where the victim wants to withdraw the complaint through fear.\u0027We have had victims of domestic violence committing suicide because they are forced into the court system.\u0027Here we have a decision in principle by the CPS prosecution was not in the public interest and having made that decision they are persuaded to change that assessment by the police even though it\u0027s nothing to do with the police. The police have no role in the public interest, it\u0027s not their job, their job is to investigate and present the file to the CPS – it is not to decide what is in the public interest.\u0027My major concern here is that the CPS\u0027s decision, which is so fundamental in the system about public interest, was overridden by the police – that shouldn\u0027t happen. I don\u0027t accept that is a legitimate exchange of views between the CPS and the police.\u0027  A CPS spokesperson said it stood by its decision and said Flack\u0027s fame had no bearing on it.They added: \u0027A suspect\u0027s celebrity status is not a factor in our decisions to prosecute.\u0027Our handling of this case was carefully reviewed throughout and our guidance and legal tests were followed.We are satisfied that the prosecution was correctly brought. \u0027The issue of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health was addressed on a number of occasions throughout the legal process. Our decisions were made on the basis of the medical opinion available to us each time.\u0027As the inquest heard there was clearly a more significant history of issues and a further deterioration of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health of which we had not been made aware.\u0027 Justice on Trial: Radical Solutions for a System at Breaking Point: Chris Daw: Bloomsbury Continuum"},{"url":null,"title":"Boy six swept sea inflatable swan","story":"Share this articleLIVE: Coastguard, ambulance and police at Black Rock Sands beach incident - North Wales Live"},{"url":null,"title":"Stop going gold shoes bright clothes says Tates female boss","story":"Share this article ‘I hadn’t thought about that.

Meanwhile, a third of British consumers now have meat-free days and regularly buy plant-based milk alternatives. But is a vegan diet really as healthy as we are led to believe?Many people claim they feel better and have more energy on a plant-based diet. Some will benefit because they begin to think more carefully about what they are eating, choose healthier foods and avoid random snacking.However, veganism doesn’t mean eating limp lettuce leaves, tasteless tofu and a few bland beans. Nowadays there’s vegan mac ‘n’ cheese, ‘bleeding’ beetroot burgers and vegan fried chicken. There are also plant-based versions of favourite meats, cheeses, desserts and ice creams, pumped full of chemicals, sugar and saturated fats.Whether your sausage roll is made from a pig or Quorn, or your burger from beef or soy, they’re all highly processed and high in calories, saturated fat and salt.What’s more, vegan and vegetarian foods are marketed as healthier than they in fact are, and some, such as vegan fish fingers, contain up to 40 artificial ingredients.While the craze for plant-based milks has taken off, there’s no evidence they’re any healthier than cow’s milk. Many are devoid of key nutrients such as calcium, iron and B12 found in dairy, and can contain excessive levels of chemicals and additives.A bigger concern is the rise in veganism among children. Studies have shown that vegan children are often smaller and have low levels of nutrients such as riboflavin and B12. In extreme cases these deficiencies have led to high-profile deaths.So, veganism per se is not necessarily healthy. Most of the benefit is probably just through eating a greater variety of plants and fibre, which can be achieved by people consuming small amounts of meat and dairy. Don’t feel pressured into buying these plant-based alternatives, which are often full of additives, sugar and fat.© Tim Spector, 2020Spoon-Fed: Why Almost Everything We’ve Been Told About Food Is Wrong, by Tim Spector, is published by Jonathan Cape on August 27, priced £12.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100085941f6850f256b3292185f94328abb9969f/0_333_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e2581daa603e66f6e95ef73e5e15689","title":"the big picture on the road with los angeles alternative schoolie movement","story":"Photographer Dotan Saguy captures an American family’s existence in a former school busMore than 16,000 people in Los Angeles live in cars, vans and buses. Some are part of the “schoolie” movement, families who have bought an old school bus and converted it into a mobile home.Photographer Dotan Saguy met Ismael and Greice Reis and their three children on the first day they arrived in the city in 2019 in their yellow school bus. Ismael and Greice were Mormons, originally from Brazil. The kids were aged two, five and 10. Saguy spent most of the year photographing the family as they tried to survive in LA in their bus. His book Nowhere to Go But Everywhere documents their progress.They had been travelling by then for six months after Ismael had given up his job as a waiter in Delaware. They had set out with a tank full of gas and $400. Casual work had proved hard to find. Their worst stories always began “Our bus broke down”. Once, in Pennsylvania, in the absence of alternatives, Ismael was forced to sit outside a Walmart with a cardboard sign reading: “Hungry, travelling with family, auto problems, please help.” He raised $200 in an hour.Though the family set out with the idea of being missionaries, they had come to doubt their faith. A different kind of philosophy had taken over, one they learned from watching The Lion King: “hakuna matata”, no worries, live for the moment. “I’m totally devoted to it,” Ismael said. “I’m not thinking about how I’m going to pay my bills next month or whether I’m running out of milk. It’s almost like you’re Tarzan swinging on a vine: in order to continue moving, you need to let go and trust the next vine will be there to carry you forward.

Its name also adorned the lanyards worn by attendees of the 2017 Tory conference. The sponsorship is recorded as an £8,000 donation by the Electoral Commission.The new tariff-free quota equates to a £72.8m saving, according to analysis by Greenpeace’s Unearthed investigations team. The quota’s introduction comes after a long and public lobbying campaign by the company. Greenpeace said Tate \u0026amp Lyle had held at least 10 meetings with senior ministers over the last three years.The reform is the latest chapter in a Brexit subplot that has split the UK’s sugar industry. Tate \u0026amp Lyle’s main rival makes sugar from sugar beets produced by British farmers. “This is all to do with them wanting to be able to import cane sugar more easily than they did before and it looks like the government has granted them their wish,” said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank.“Tate and Lyle Sugars had a legitimate issue in that the only reason that these barriers existed was because the EU was trying to protect domestic sugar producers,” Lowe added.“It’s not us that are going to get any money from this. It’s our competitors that have been subsidised by the EU all these years. What it will do is allow us to buy from some extra countries that we can’t buy from today. It’s not a cash subsidy. We would never buy from suppliers where we have to pay the full tariff, because it’s uneconomic.”Greenpeace accused Tate \u0026amp Lyle of planning to use the new rules to import sugar cane from countries with lower employment and environmental standards. “This is a sweet deal for a food giant with close ties to the Conservative party and easy access to ministers, but it’s a bitter one for our environmental standards and farmers,” said John Sauven, Greenpeace’s executive director. “Ditching tariffs on raw cane sugar will boost imports from a handful of countries, all of which use pesticides banned in the UK for being harmful to wildlife and humans.”However, Mason said it was “a complete fantasy” that Tate \u0026amp Lyle wanted to import cheap, poorly produced sugar. “In Australia and Brazil, which are two countries we’d love to buy more from, they have the highest numbers of sugar producers who are certified for the highest ethical environmental standards in the world.“We’ve never hidden our issues with Europe. We’ve been quite transparent about it. Yes, we have ministers visit the refinery to talk about the issues. We have Labour party politicians, we have Lib Dem politicians. Anybody who can help us secure the future of our business in the UK, we will speak to very openly and transparently.”Paul Kenward, managing director of British Sugar, which refines beet sugar, said: “The UK has the opportunity to decide its own post-Brexit international trade policy – balancing the interests of all players in the market, including those of the homegrown beet sugar industry, developing countries and the refining sector. We simply do not understand how this policy squares with stated trade objectives, and we are asking the government serious questions about the policy and its implementation.”A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “The government has sought to balance strategic trade objectives, such as the delivery of the UK’s trade ambitions and FTA trade agenda and the interests of domestic production, processing and consumption, whilst maintaining the government’s commitment to developing countries to reduce poverty through trade.“To achieve this balance, the UK global tariff retains tariffs on sugar products, while opening a new autonomous tariff quota (ATQ) to ensure that supply is maintained while protecting developing country preferences. The government has always been clear that this ATQ will be reviewed in line with the UK’s suspensions policy in due course.“The UK global tariff schedule is tailored to the UK economy and designed to back British businesses, ensuring they compete on fair terms with the rest of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13f7747ff755bcf1d814c8635752352f300e46c/151_0_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9480bdf469601de61b5009f2555791cb","title":"pizza ovens inflatable tents and usb charging the evolution of camping","story":"Home comforts now more desirable than ‘cutting the cord’ as technology has changed the face of modern campingIt used to be considered a low-tech holiday, but while campers who want to get off-grid can still find quiet spots to pitch up and spark up the Trangia, others are unfolding their portable pizza ovens and plugging in their projectors.Advances in technology, and the rise of glamping and festivals, mean that some holidaymakers are packing a whole range of home comforts alongside their traditional camping gear.“People are making things a bit more bespoke,” said Mike Attwooll, product buyer at the camp shop Attwoolls. “You go out for the day and back to your base at night and it’s like home.”Ten years ago electrical hook-ups were unusual, but now they are the norm, he said, as campers look to plug in phones and run equipment they would previously have left behind. He had recently seen photos of someone holding a film night in their tent using a mini-projector, he said.James Warner Smith of the website Cool Camping said technology had brought modern campers a whole range of choices. “Some guys have developed a folding pizza oven that you can take with you. It does rotisserie chicken too,” he said. “There’s a no-electricity coffee maker, and there are quite few stoves that have USB ports in them so you can charge your phone while you are cooking.” One of these, the £149.99 Tegology Tegstove, won investment on Dragons Den.Attwooll said he had recently been looking at a brochure from the 1960s and many products were the same, but that recent innovations meant better versions were available.“The most important things are what you’re sleeping under and what you’re sleeping on,” he said. Eighty-five per cent of family tents are now inflatable, and campers pump up sturdy beams instead of metal poles.Iain Geddes, senior technical adviser the Camping and Caravanning Club, said affordable inflatable tents were “one of the few big sudden changes” in the market. “Suddenly I was getting calls from people, like one from a single mum saying can I put one of these up on my own,” he said. The fact that the answer was yes has made camping accessible for some who would struggle with traditional tents.Deflating airbeds have ruined many camping trips, and are now being replaced with a new generation of self-inflating mats which offer comfort and reliability. And there have been changes in sleeping bag technology, which mean those who want a bit more comfort under canvas can get it. Attwooll cites a bag aimed at women which has thicker material at the bottom, and another – launched this year by Vango - which comes with a thermal heatpad that can be plugged into a power pack.Visit any campsite though and you will probably still see at least one bell tent. These have enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, which Warner Smith puts down, in part, to social media. “In the Instagram age people have an idea of what things should look like, so they will pitch their bell tent and put up some bunting.”He said changes were being inspired by trips to festivals, and by glamping sites that offer fixed tents, pods and shepherd’s huts beautifully decorated and kitted out with comfortable beds.“You have a lot of sites where this is a mixture of fixed tents and traditional pitches, and people are seeing the glamping and bringing some of it to their own experience,” he said. “At the same time there has been the growth of music festivals. Campsite owners have seen the food trucks and some sites will now have them at the weekend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37381e04b00d3d4dd099d07f156d822639d44ed2/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c6d99d11f83fb119c545a8fe3a17fb3","title":"working from home british land zoom office property","story":"Temperature checks at reception, spaced-out desks, contactless coffee dispensers and plastic lift-button prodders. Welcome back to work – in an anti-Covid-19 office. These features, which would have been deemed eccentric and invasive in January, are some of the measures being deployed for returning employees by one of the UK’s biggest companies, property firm British Land.Unusually among office-based firms, it began to allow workers back on a voluntary basis in June. The guidance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland remains for people to work from home where possible.Early reports, and a  analysis, suggest many employers based in England, including financial, law and energy firms, are sticking to home working until at least September some companies, including Google and NatWest, have delayed a return until 2021. On their first day back in the office, each British Land employee is presented with a branded pouch containing a mask, a digital thermometer and a plastic lift-button pusher, with a note thanking them for their commitment.On a tour of head office, chief executive Chris Grigg says the company’s policy of keeping its buildings open during lockdown, even while unoccupied, and its own return to its headquarters, have given it insight into how best to prepare sites for the return of workers.Not all measures are visible: British Land has made alterations to heating and ventilation systems, which are potential pathways for a virus travelling through a building.On the day the Observer visited, Nigel Webb, head of developments, and learning and development manager Matt Buxton were among those who had opted to come in to work. Along with other colleagues at spaced-out desks in the open-plan office, or in meeting rooms, Webb and Buxton say this makes them feel more productive and able to collaborate with colleagues.Other staff have chosen not to come back to the office yet because of “practical examples of bad transport, or childcare”, says Grigg, adding that his experience with his own staff allows the company to be “more in touch” with tenants, who may be returning at a slower pace.Workers’ mental health could also be harmed by months working and living in the same space, says Grigg, while continued remote working could foster inequality.“Unfortunately the evidence seems to point to work in this different form of living falling disproportionately on women. The risk is that this becomes another form of inequality: home working is a lot easier if you have access to screens and machines and bandwidth, and if you have a nice study at home.”The need for social distancing inside lifts makes accessing high-rise buildings more challenging but British Land, which developed the Cheesegrater, the tallest building in the City of London, maintains there is a future for skyscrapers.Grigg draws parallels with the period following the 2001 attacks on New York’s twin towers, when changes in airline safety restored confidence in high-rise offices. He believes skyscrapers will regain popularity once a vaccine is developed or coronavirus can be controlled.Ultimately, Griggs believes that an office allows firms to reach intangible goals – such as innovation – in the way Zoom calls cannot. People will have to come back.He says: “Things like co-operation, innovation, different ways of thinking about doing things are hard to do on your own, and they are hard to simulate even using the most modern communications.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9579d0b53d04352aaa9fde29b3e275dbe70799c/0_161_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=651621f3a4fbfb3b1027ec9c621df794","title":"the dominic cummings effect cartoon","story":"How many rotten apples does it take to destroy trust in the government?• You can buy your own copy of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852167568db68fc5dfacc0620dfa8aab4222a4c6/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9ea2977856cc0ea8f2773e3006b6b279","title":"a level result predictions to be downgraded england","story":"Exclusive: Assessments likely to be adjusted down before students receive results – analysis That would mean nearly 300,000 A-levels issued are lower than the teacher assessment of the more than 730,000 A-level entries in England this summer.Including GCSEs, which are expected to have a similar downgrade rate, close to a net 2m teacher assessments will be adjusted downwards and in many cases ignored completely.There was uproar in Scotland this week when the exams authority rejected nearly 124,000 grade recommendations from teachers – a quarter of the total – but unlike in Scotland, English pupils are barred from appealing against their results on academic grounds.Grades will instead be issued according to Ofqual’s statistical model, relying on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s previous exam results, to replace the exams scrapped by the government after schools were closed because of the coronavirus lockdown.Those most at risk of receiving revised grades appear to be students on the border between B and C grades, and between C and D grades, and pupils at comprehensive schools with wide variations in attainment or patchy outcomes in courses over the three previous years of data that Ofqual is using to cap inidual school results.Teachers will still have a significant influence on how grades are distributed in each school, having compiled the rankings that will determine which pupils receive the final grades allocated by Ofqual for their course.Headteachers and exam officials in England say they fear a storm of controversy even worse than that which has engulfed Scotland, where a quarter of teacher predictions were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.Experts say that as Ofqual has barred inidual pupils from appealing against their grades on academic grounds, families should not waste time complaining but instead contact college or university admissions offices to confirm their places in the event of unexpectedly poor grades.Tim Oates, group director of research and development at the exam board Cambridge Assessment, said: “Grades have been awarded this year by combining lots of data, including the rank order and the grades submitted by teachers. We have seen from Scotland’s press coverage that it’s all too easy to fixate on the difference between the teacher-assessed grades and the final grades. But it’s a misleading distraction and misinforms the public. The teacher grades were an important part of the process but always only going to be a part.“On results day, energy should be channelled into how each young person can progress swiftly with what they have been awarded, rather than time lost on agonising over an apparently controversial but fundamentally misleading difference between teacher grades and final grades.”Statisticians have criticised Ofqual’s algorithm, saying it does not have sufficient data to award grades fairly to most state schools in England, because of wide variations in results within schools and between years.The Royal Statistical Society has called for an urgent review of the statistical procedures used in England and Scotland, to be carried out by the UK Statistics Authority. “This should consider both the substantive issues of the data used and the adjustment algorithms of the various nations, but also whether greater transparency would have been possible and beneficial,” the society said.“It gives the public the impression that in most cases the grades the student receive would still be the predicted grades. However, closer analysis shows that this is not true,” Duong said.In response, a spokesperson for Ofqual said: “From the data that we have reviewed we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, and almost all grades students receive will be the same as the centre assessment grades or within one grade. The exact proportions vary by subject and we will publish the figures on results day.”But Duong also found that a comprehensive secondary school can have a huge annual variation in results for inidual courses, with the small numbers of entries involved suggesting that Ofqual’s decisions are statistically invalid.Duong said: “These fluctuations mean that Ofqual’s statistical modelling cannot make sense. The problem is that any statistical model is only as good as the data you feed it, and for a typical comprehensive school, there simply isn’t enough A-level data from 2017 to 2019 for any statistical modelling.”In response, Ofqual said: “For A-level, three years of historical results inform the standardisation of grades. You can think of this as an averaging across the years of data.”Uncertainty over the grades being awarded has led universities to say they will relax offers to prospective students and make use of other data.Admissions officers for Peterhouse College, Cambridge, said during a Q\u0026ampA on the Student Room website: “We are looking into which schools (from among our offer holders) are most likely to be adversely affected by the system of awarded grades so we are in a better position to make nuanced decisions when we get the results.”In a significant sign that it recognised the controversy likely to erupt on Thursday when students receive A-level results, Ofqual this week changed its position and said schools would be able to appeal if they expected “a very different pattern of grades to results in previous years”. But Ofqual will not allow inidual students to appeal against their grades on academic grounds, as they can in Scotland.For A-level pupils, teacher assessments will only be used to help set grades on small courses, with five or fewer candidates. On larger courses, teacher assessment will play little or no role, with grades being awarded instead based on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s previous exam results.The pupils most likely to benefit from teacher assessments will be those taking courses with very small entries of five pupils or less, such as German or music. Those taking popular subjects such as maths or biology, with more than 15 pupils, will be exposed to Ofqual’s algorithm and the teacher assessment will be ignored.Kate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The government should have ensured that Ofqual had a robust appeals system in place from the beginning, instead of announcing one a matter of days before A-level results. They must do far more to ensure the system is genuinely fair.”Students unhappy with their results have the option of sitting exams in autumn. But with students entering university or college, few are expected to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92affcac648deb900f6acbfe2721cfebf04fe3fd/0_2_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd587107860917497dec10dcbba5d1c","title":"a level students tell us how youre feeling about getting your results","story":"We’d like to hear from sixth form students about the upcoming results dayThis week, the Scottish Qualifications Authority came under fire after admitting it downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended A-level results, heightening existing fears that school leavers’ grades would be negatively impacted by the pandemic across the UK.However, some assessment experts have said that this year’s results, based on a combination of teachers’ recommendations, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, and statistical modelling by examiners, will be fairer than ever.As results day approaches, we’d like to hear from students about how they’re feeling, and what they’re expecting.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Its annual consumption of coal plunged to the lowest level in 250 years. According to figures released last week, a mere 8 million tonnes were incinerated in UK factories and power plants. That is roughly the same amount that was burned nationally in 1769, when James Watt was patenting his modified steam engine.That invention helped to spark the Industrial Revolution and triggered a massive rise in annual coal use in Britain, which soared to well over 200 million tonnes by the mid-20th century. Now levels have plummeted back to their original pre-revolution state. King coal – once the undisputed ruler of British industry – has finally been dethroned.It has been an extraordinary transformation. Britain evolved into a world power thanks to its use of coal. It was the first western nation to mine it and burn it on a large scale, and it was the first to fill its cities with polluted smog, factories and power plants as a result. Coal runs along a deep, dark vein through British history.“For centuries, Britain led the world in coal production,” says Barbara Freese in her book about the dark stuff, Coal: A Human History. “It triggered the Industrial Revolution and created an industrial society the likes of which the world had never seen.”Or, as George Orwell put it in his 1937 essay, Down the Mine: “Civilisation … is founded on coal. The machines that keep us alive, and the machines that make machines, are all directly or indirectly dependent upon coal.”That was then, of course. Today, coal has long lost its lustre, to say the least. Its name evokes images of grimy poverty while its links to deadly air pollution, and its role in the dangerous overheating of our climate, have made it an increasingly unpopular source of energy in the UK. It provided Britain with enormous power but at an exorbitant cost in terms of pollution and the diseases – asthma, cancer, and heart and lung ailments – that emerged in its wake.Other countries – Germany, Poland, China among them – still burn coal in significant quantities. But the nation that first took advantage of it, and which built an empire using the industrial might it conferred, has now emphatically turned its back on coal.“Coal use in the UK had been declining for some time but over the past few years it has dropped like a stone,” says Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, the climate change website. “Clean air acts, the end of steam trains, the rise of North Sea oil and of course increasing awareness of coal’s role in raising temperatures in the atmosphere have all played a part.Coal beds were laid down between 290 and 360 million years ago in a geological age known as the Carboniferous period, a name – coined by English geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822 – that simply means “coal-bearing”.During the Carboniferous period, plants covered the landscape, and when they died they formed layers of organic material in oxygen-poor swamps. First they were converted into peat, and then, after millions of years of deep burial, into coal, a combustible black rock containing traces of hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen.Coal was burned in hearths and fireplaces in Roman times but it was not fully exploited until the 18th century, when improvements to the technology of steam engines saw them replace waterwheels, windmills and horses as the nation’s main providers of power. These refinements culminated in Watt’s invention of the separate condenser, which transformed the efficiency of steam engines and led to their widespread use in textile mills, mines and dozens of other heavy industries. Thousands of steam engines – all powered by burning coal – were installed across the country within a few years.In the early 19th century, steam engines were further developed and used to transport goods and humans. Railways spread across the nation. Then, in 1882, Holborn viaduct power station, the world’s first coal-fired power plant, began to generate electricity for public use in London. Other cities followed suit. Coal was beginning to embed itself in the fabric of British life.Over the years, coal continued to strengthen its grip on Britain, dampened only by disruptions such as miners’ strikes or the great depression, until, by the 1950s, the UK was utterly reliant on it for its energy and heating. Britons burned it in grates to heat their homes, shovelled it into the furnaces of huge generating plants to make electricity, made steel with it and used it as the fuel to run the nation’s railways – just as it had done for the previous 100 years.But change was in the air. Yellow smog generated by coal fires hung over cities in increasingly thick blankets. This culminated in the great smog of London that enveloped the city for five days in December 1952, bringing life in the capital to a standstill while killing thousands from bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses in the process.The Clean Air Act of 1956 was a direct response to the great smog. It encouraged householders to use other fuels – gas, electricity or less-polluting solid fuels – to heat their homes and stop using coal. Ironically, coal use reached around 210 million tonnes that year, its peak consumption over the past two centuries. That was also the year the UK established the world’s first civil nuclear programme, opening a nuclear power station at Windscale, in Cumbria. It would be downhill for Britain’s black gold from then on.Next came the railways. In the 1960s, diesel and electric trains were introduced on the simple grounds that they were more efficient and far cleaner to operate. The end for steam came on 11 August in 1968, when the last mainline passenger train to be hauled by steam locomotive power left on an excursion from Liverpool to Carlisle and back.Slowly, the need to burn coal to run British industry was being scaled down. The next watershed occurred in 1984, with the strike that brought defeat for the National Union of Mineworkers and triggered a series of widespread colliery closures across the country.“The challenge for the next few years is to get rid of coal completely, and then after that it will be to reduce the amount of gas that’s burned to make electricity in generators,” said Professor Keith Bell of the University of Strathclyde, co-director of the UK Energy Research Centre.“We should look at last year as marking the beginning of the end for fossil fuels as sources of energy for electricity generation, and not before time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c14d4d4c47f4fbf242452962d541be0b824f7f7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33569ae1439ae01bfa4053177f6982b","title":"10 of the best mens swim shorts in pictures","story":"Whether you’re having a staycation or travelling further afield, here’s our pick of this season’s best swimming trunks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2a07feb67a48f6cbaa89707462b14f659dc0c2/0_137_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f518b3f035e8d7555e5fca058812472","title":"we love fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Mother Denim launch new Aura collection, plus beach towels made from recycled plastic bottles, and slippers built to last"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba64370e4cf916f9abac5f09792a60419d2fc59/0_109_2358_1415/master/2358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f1789ffb998d465a9c03ff6b942b8b","title":"lewandowski leads bayern munich masterclass in hammering of chelsea","story":"Even Didier Drogba would have struggled to dig Chelsea out of this hole. There was no dramatic turnaround. There was no Petr Cech to perform heroics in goal, no Drogba to power a header past Manuel Neuer and no hope of Chelsea pulling off another miraculous comeback against Bayern Munich, who look a good bet to win the Champions League for the first time since 2013 after reaching the last eight with another ruthless display.In truth it always was fanciful to think that Chelsea, beaten 7-1 on aggregate, would be capable of burgling Bayern at the Allianz Arena again. The gulf in class was vast and, although Frank Lampard can be proud of finishing fourth in his first season as Chelsea’s manager, this was another painful reminder that his callow side remain a work in progress.While Lampard praised his players for fighting until the bitter end, Chelsea’s final match of a draining campaign was an ordeal. They will be in the Champions League again next season but they have some way to go before they are on Bayern’s level. They have not been past the last 16 of this competition since 2014 and it is not hard to see why Lampard, who captained Chelsea when they beat Bayern in front of their own supporters in the 2012 final, wants defensive reinforcements to accompany the attacking signings of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.“We will look at improving in the summer,” Lampard said. “That’s our job. We have worked at it already. From having the ban we have missed out where other clubs have spent. We have a quick turnaround. I know where we can improve in a footballing sense.”There is no escaping reality: this was a mismatch and although Chelsea tried to preserve their dignity, Bayern easily exposed their flaws. The Bundesliga winners, 3-0 up from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, showed no mercy and head to Lisbon in good nick, full of confidence before meeting Barcelona in the quarter-finals.The treble is on the cards. Bayern will fancy themselves against Barça, even though keeping Lionel Messi quiet will not be straightforward. Robert Lewandowski is in rampant form – the striker scored his 46th and 47th goals of the season here – and it is hard to find any weaknesses in Hansi Flick’s side.There was no sign of any rust, even though this was Bayern’s first competitive outing since beating Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup final on 4 July. They took control from the start and pounced in the seventh minute, Serge Gnabry drifting in from the right to release Lewandowski, who tumbled after being fouled by Willy Caballero.Chelsea’s relief at seeing the flag go up for offside faded. The referee, Ovidiu Hategan, pointed to the spot after a VAR review and Lewandowski stroked his penalty past Caballero, who was booked for the foul.Lampard, who gave little away after being asked about interest in the Leverkusen winger Kai Havertz, looked worried. Chelsea were without César Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho, Billy Gilmour, Pedro, Willian, Christian Pulisic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, forcing Lampard to name six academy prospects on the bench, and did not have the tactical discipline to contain Bayern.Flick’s side were relentless. Alphonso Davies kept motoring forward from left-back, giving Reece James a torrid time, and the second goal arrived when Mateo Kovacic dawdled near his own area, allowing Lewandowski to rob the midfielder and set up Ivan Perisic for an easy finish.Lampard, who wants a goalkeeper, a centre-back and a left-back, spoke about naive defending. Chelsea conceded 54 goals in the league this season and are slow to scent danger. Kepa Arrizabalaga, the most expensive goalkeeper in the world, was on the bench again and although Lampard dropped Antonio Rüdiger after last week’s defeat to Arsenal in the FA Cup final, his 4-3-3 system gave Bayern too much room.Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma struggled as a central defensive pairing, Emerson Palmieri was rusty after being handed a rare start at left-back and N’Golo Kanté, back in the team after a long absence with a hamstring injury, was off the pace in midfield.At least there were flickers of resistance from Chelsea. Callum Hudson-Odoi, keen to impress against the team that almost signed him last year, had a fine goal disallowed for offside against Tammy Abraham, who did pull one back when Neuer pushed a cross-shot from Emerson into his path.Yet the only real scare for Bayern came when Jérôme Boateng fell injured after retrieving a long ball. The defender was down for a while and eventually had to make way for Niklas Süle.Yet Bayern were relentless. They extended their lead when Corentin Tolisso, on as a substitute, volleyed in from close range and there was still time for Lewandowski to score again, proving once and for all that Chelsea were out of their depth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c063e6784614a8af430688f5cf1a317a2e187316/0_128_5181_3109/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9381d638fc9edf74cde315da3c6e722d","title":"lionel messi scales heights to sink napoli and book barcelonas passage","story":"Progress for Barcelona, and yet the spectre of a first trophyless season since 2008 somehow seems to loom larger than ever. They made it past Napoli and into the Champions League quarter-finals, but with the sort of leaden, listless display that makes it almost impossible to envisage them holding aloft the trophy in Lisbon on 23 August. Almost.That they have even a puncher’s chance is due largely to the man who was again their salvation in this game. Any team with Lionel Messi pointing in the right direction can never quite be counted out, and here it was his unshakeable balance and insoluble will that brought him within three wins of the prize he craves more than any other.And yet on this evidence – a continuation of the anaemic, disjointed football that saw them pipped to the La Liga title by Real Madrid – Barcelona feel further from the pinnacle of the game than they have done at any point since Messi’s arrival.Quique Setien’s side – although only just, if reports from Catalonia are to be believed – still look painfully short in key areas. Injuries have hit them hard, but harder than they should probably be hitting a club that has spent £767m on transfers in the last seven seasons. The lack of anything remotely approaching a pressing game, or even the poise to dominate a midfield as they once did so instinctively, goes beyond personnel. In many ways, this game was the modern Barcelona in microcosm: two set-piece goals, a slice of Messi brilliance, and not much else. It may be a blueprint, and frequently an effective one at that. But it looks nothing like an identity.Has there been a Barcelona team since the dog days of the Frank Rijkaard era that has looked so inelegant in possession, so inert out of it, so content to let opposition teams play? Gennaro Gattuso’s Napoli are a spirited but by no means flawless unit, as their indifferent Serie A form indicates. Yet here, at a deserted Camp Nou, they were handed the keys to the place, and with a deader eye for goal might even have snatched the tie outright.To be fair, most of their 18 shots (to Barcelona’s seven) were blocked, and most came after Barcelona had already made the tie safe in the first 45 minutes.That they did so was largely due to the luminosity of Messi and the caprice of VAR rather than any winning strategy. Napoli actually started the better and, had Dries Mertens hit the target within 90 seconds rather than slicing his shot against the post, we might have been discussing a very different game.Instead, Barcelona restored regular service after 10 minutes, Clément Lenglet heading home Ivan Rakitic’s corner having first shoved Diego Demme into Kalidou Koulibaly, taking them both out. With the game a quarter through, Messi tumbled to the turf under the twin challenges of Lorenzo Insigne and Mário Rui, and yet somehow still managed to scramble to his feet.With the ball, of course: this is Messi, after all, and as he regained his balance the ball somehow clung to him like a faithful dog. With his footing giving way again, he somehow managed to hold himself upright for just long enough to curl the ball past David Ospina and into virtually the only square of goal that the goalkeeper was unable to reach.In a largely drab game, this was the one real moment of grace: a reminder that for all the dross around him, Messi can still generally be relied on to raise the tone.It could have been still worse for Napoli, but Messi’s second goal – courtesy of a delicious cross by Frenkie de Jong – was chalked off by the VAR for a faint handball. Still, when Luiz Suárez slammed home a penalty on the stroke of half-time, after Koulibaly had clipped Messi’s calf, Napoli were 3-0 down, and seemingly out.But in the very last twitches of the first half, Napoli pulled a goal back: Insigne converting from the spot after Rakitic had brought down Mertens. If this was a reminder to Barcelona of their own essential fallibility, then it was one that went unheeded: Napoli dominated the second half without ever quite threatening to unlock the grandstand finish. Remarkably, Setien waited until the 84th minute before using the first of his 12 available substitutes, by which time Hirving Lozano and Arkadiusz Milk had already come close to narrowing the deficit.Full time was greeted with the usual muted celebrations, the usual desultory handshakes and fist-bumps. A rumbling discontent has long infused this club, one that on its worst days seems immune even to victory. Laboured, sluggish and dangerously reliant on one man’s miracles: this is the Barcelona of 2020, and for all the surgery this great club requires, things may yet get worse before they get better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84c0d1c35e8f3da9cbf9b61b02d6d22082d694c/232_876_2564_1539/master/2564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858358bc1fced4a158ec8be412300a01","title":"jonathan pryce this much i know love is the most important thing","story":"The actor, 73, on surviving coronavirus, being Pope for a few weeks, and a smouldering Warren BeattyMy father had a nervous breakdown.

But understanding what you want from this relationship must be your priorityThe dilemma My partner’s relationships with other men is concerning me. She has admitted to sleeping with close to 100 men in the past, many for personal gain – including cash, gifts and holidays. I was shell-shocked, not so much that she participated, but that she confessed so blatantly. I also know that she has flirted with married men, enjoying dinner and sharing a hotel bed with one of them.To me it appears that as a woman who was abandoned by her father at a young age, she struggles to say no to men. She went on holiday with a female friend and came back with a new man’s number in her phone whom she messaged frequently, and said I was being silly when I asked about him. She has no qualms about telling me that her male colleagues look at her in a way that suggests they’re interested in her. She appears to thirst for this attention, perhaps subconsciously.Her reaction to my concerns is normally anger and so I avoid these topics, although inside me it is grating. I love her and have cut all ties with past flames, so she has nothing to worry about in terms of my faithfulness, but this is not reciprocated. Do I have it out with her, or shrug and accept that this is who she is?Mariella replies Where to begin? Certainly not with a headcount of past lovers, which means little or nothing and certainly has no real bearing on your current predicament. If you’re judging a partner by the number of people they’ve slept with, then your priorities are seriously questionable. Then again, I’m not impressed by the transactional nature of some of her past choices either. The question you should be asking is what this woman is looking for, and do you have the strength, courage or, indeed, desire to help her find it.She seems to need love, not in a clingy way but in a manner that aims to serve an all-consuming hunger for someone to feed her emotional cravings. You tell me a lot about her, but very little about you and why your needs and desires should be so sublimated. What do you want from this relationship? Do you want to be tortured in this way by the desirability and unpredictability of another?Your girlfriend sounds like she has issues with self-esteem and misplaced ideas of how to gain self-worth. I’m presuming much of what you describe has happened in the past and, as LP Hartley famously said: “The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there.” What happened before you two got together may offer you context, but it’s irrelevant when it comes to defining how she should behave in your relationship.I feel sorry for your girlfriend because losing your father as a young girl is as painful as parting can get, and instils in all but the most resilient a sense of failure and lack of self-value that can remain throughout life. I know quite a few women – myself included – who took until their late 30s or early 40s to shrug off that burden and realise that they don’t have to shoulder the blame or carry the responsibility for a parent’s absence.As you say, your partner seems to be trying to replace her father with any member of his sex that she thinks has the potential to fill the space he left behind. It’s not that she can’t say no to men but that she’s under the illusion that sheer weight of numbers will ground her desire.In reality, the unconditional love she seeks is the kind only a parent can offer. You can’t stop her mourning her father’s absence, but you can possibly help her see that what she’s looking for lies within her – and is for her alone to mend. This isn’t about the lovers she’s had, could potentially have or, in the worst-case scenario, continues to have. It’s about a damaged little girl trying to replace her first love with a succession of alternatives.You could be flattered that she has found enough of a home in you to slow the pace of her relentless quest, but as you’ve observed she’s not done searching. That’s why I asked at the beginning if you had the energy and commitment to try to help steer her to safe harbour. But the only way you can ever help anybody else is to first understand yourself, and I’d propose that’s where you begin this quest. Try to understand your own motivation in enduring the insecurity she provokes. While she works out her own priorities, what is obvious is that all this emotional fog leaves little room for a clear view – so neither of you knows yet if you have found what you’re looking for.Whether you can shape what you have into something less debilitating is a question I can’t answer, but bigger romantic miracles have occurred. In answer to your question, I don’t think you need have it out, nor shrug and accept – instead I suggest a more imaginative journey where you learn a lot more about your own desires as a route to finding out whether you can, or even want, to keep up with hers. Major emotional investment, resilience and commitment will be required along the way but your adventure will be fruitless if you don’t get to know the landscape of your own heart first.

In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself. It is a period of grinding negotiation between a virus whose dynamics are still mysterious and the increasingly pressing need to earn incomes, educate children and connect with one another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a8deb3fcf592cd80fec1435c48bdc0e7ed2cb0/0_0_2555_1534/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32fe8f380d1792dd3c4f791c197d9b45","title":"hadley freeman on the future of the royals","story":" columnist Hadley Freeman discusses the fallout from the publication of Finding Freedom, a biography of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the latest allegations surrounding Prince Andrew columnist Hadley Freeman tells Rachel Humphreys why 2020 is not shaping up to be a great year for the royals.

The officials, who are not named, were uncooperative and refused to allocate resources to winnable target seats, the submission said.Given Labour’s narrow loss in 2017, they argued: “It’s not impossible that Jeremy Corbyn might now be in his third year as a Labour prime minister were it not for the unauthorised, unilateral action taken by a handful of senior party officials.”The narrative is vehemently opposed by the officials concerned, one of whom called it “a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves”, adding that all spending was legitimate, declared and accounted for.The row erupted when the 860-page internal party report, authored anonymously, was leaked to the media in April, shortly after Keir Starmer took over from Corbyn.It claimed that as well as undermining the 2017 election, internal opponents of Corbyn hampered efforts to tackle antisemitism within Labour, and it quoted WhatsApp messages from party officials insulting his allies, some with apparently racist or sexist overtones.Starmer set up the inquiry under lawyer Martin Forde QC. It had a deadline of Friday for accepting initial evidence.Corbyn’s claims, seen by the , are made jointly with Labour’s 2017 election committee, also comprising McDonnell, the former shadow ministers Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, and five senior aides to Corbyn at the time: Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Andrew Fisher, Andrew Murray and Steve Howell.The claim that hostile Labour officials jeopardised the 2017 election campaign has caused fury among Corbyn’s supporters. His joint submission said: “We believe that there is clear evidence of factional activity by senior paid employees of the party against the elected leadership of the time.”They allege that in 2017 hostile officials set up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course, which included starving potential target seats of money and focusing resources on MPs not allied to Corbyn.If claims in the report of significant sums of money being spent on such actions without authority are correct, then the inquiry must consider “whether it may have constituted fraudulent activity”, the submission said.More generally, the joint statement condemns what it calls a “toxic culture” at Labour headquarters, saying this is demonstrated by the WhatsApp messages.One of the officials blamed by Corbyn told the  the submission was not true. “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence,” the official said.“Pro-Corbyn staff inspected tens of thousands of former staff emails in January 2020 to try and find evidence of their ridiculous conspiracy theory. They found nothing because it is not real. They are trying to build a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves of the consequences of their incompetence.”In contrast, the official said, there were emails showing Corbyn’s team tried to push election resources in 2017 towards protecting loyalist MPs in safe seats, at the expense of marginal constituencies. has separately seen the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage. They allege that the leaked report misused their WhatsApp messages to falsely make them seem racist and sexist, and confirm they are suing Labour for data protection breaches and libel over the document.Mark Lewis of Patron Law, who is representing some of the Labour officials, said: “It would not be appropriate to make comment at this stage. The matters are before the Forde inquiry and will be the subject of litigation.”The Corbyn document also talks about a general “daily hostility and obstruction” by officials towards the then leader and his team.In a separate submission to the inquiry, a former Labour press officer and adviser to McDonnell made similar allegations. Joe Ryle said he witnessed a “constant battle” with Labour HQ over appointing staff, and routine briefings to the media against Corbyn. In his submission, also seen by the , Ryle wrote: “Work colleagues of mine would regularly turn up to meetings with party staff and by the time they got back to their desks the contents of the meeting had already been leaked to journalists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddc81fba0a38806422cf7e95f07b1e99e8e2fa6/0_172_5201_3123/master/5201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c21e352219fbc266fd815e840089b8","title":"two stories different witnesses so where was dominic cummings on 19 april","story":"Witness accounts pile on pressure for PM’s aide to show proof he did not visit Durham a second time in lockdown The official version is Cummings’s own, and places him squarely in London. While the prime minister’s chief aide notoriously acknowledged a trip to Durham in late March, his denial of a second visit days after he returned was unequivocal.On a sunny afternoon in the Downing Street rose garden, he insisted the witness who said they had seen him admiring bluebells in Houghall woods was wrong, and he had the evidence.“Photos and data on my phone prove this to be false,” he said. “And local CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.” Cummings has not wavered from that line, and the prime minister later said he had seen evidence himself.A witness in London has now come forward to support that story, telling the  they saw Cummings with his family on Hampstead Heath on the Sunday afternoon.Case closed? Not quite. Since then, three other people have set out their own version of events. Like the first witness, who came forward in May, they say they saw Cummings in Houghall woods near Durham that morning, and say they are as sure as they can be it was him – but would accept they saw a lookalike if he showed them the proof.“It would be great to see if he could produce anything,” said Clare Edwards, 59, a nurse practitioner. “I just want the truth to be out there.”But even as those two stories conflict, the only people with the power to reconcile them appear reluctant to do so.When Downing Street was asked by the  to produce the phone data that Cummings said could prove his story, it declined. Meanwhile, two witnesses who reported their alleged Durham sighting to police say they fear the investigation into their claims was cursory at best.The new accounts bring fresh scrutiny to how Downing Street and police handled the affair – and drag attention back to Cummings’s nightmarish few days in May, culminating in his unprecedented press conference.Just as Cummings was speaking in the rose garden, Edwards and her husband Dave were making a statement of their own. They had gone to Durham police to report their alleged sighting. And while some of the public fury that Cummings clung on to his job without so much as an apology has abated, the couple are angrier than ever.After they went to the police, officers dismissed the evidence as “insufficient”. However, the couple say that the internal police communications they were shown at their request, under data protection rules, may indicate that the police’s investigation fell short. They have reported Durham constabulary to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct.Clare Edwards said in her statement to police that she saw Cummings just after 11.01am on 19 April – a detail she gave because of a timestamped photo she had taken moments before on her phone. Dave Edwards said the man was among a group of five adults and a child. His wife added: “I’m certainly sure that it was Dominic Cummings.”Durham police said in response: “As outlined in our statement of 28 May, Durham constabulary carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.”If Boris Johnson had hoped the affair was behind the government, the Edwards’ account – along with those of two other witnesses – is a reminder of the unanswered questions that have lingered since the  and Daily Mirror broke the story in May.There were concerns over the scope of the police investigation, which was confined to Cummings’s movements in County Durham and did not address why he left London in the first place with his sick wife, or whether hours earlier he had breached the rules by going back to work at Downing Street after tending to her.There are other questions, too. Why did Cummings say he had warned about coronavirus last year, when he altered his blog to make it look as if he had? Was there really no one in London he could ask to look after his son, as he claimed? And were there “no taxis” on 3 April when he drove to Durham hospital to pick up the sick child? Taxi firms in the city insist plenty were available.And is it possible for Cummings to have been seen in Durham and in London on the same same day?The London witness who came forward in support of Cummings’s claim said they saw the aide, his wife and their four-year-old son on Hampstead Heath that Sunday afternoon. The witness provided a distant photograph apparently showing them at 3.31pm in a meadow area on the northern edge of the heath.The last alleged sighting in County Durham was at 11.15-11.30am that day, near the Cummings family farm.A typical journey time between the two spots is more than four hours – but that is in normal traffic. In an attempt to replicate the emptier road conditions of lockdown, the  drove from north London to Durham early on a Sunday morning, and back. Travelling in a 17-year-old Honda Civic, the journey one way was completed in well under four hours. So it is feasible that Cummings could have made the trip in that time in his Land Rover Discovery on the empty roads during lockdown.Such was the furore over the disclosure of his first trip to Durham, it will be difficult for the government to move on fully from the scandal without an adequate explanation. For critics, the episode has become an emblem of the government’s mishandling of the crisis. There is evidence, too, the affair damaged the nation’s  unity during lockdown, a charge that may yet haunt ministers if there is a substantial second wave.A No 10 spokesman said: “Durham constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.”There was no comment on specific allegations that Cummings was in Durham on 19 April.With the new witness accounts, the pressure on Cummings and the government to supply phone and photographic evidence only grows. He is facing at least three legal challenges about his movements during the lockdown. In his own words: “I think that people like me who helped make the rules should be accountable for their actions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e00b44f90b3fe6c3fc79d9e87b70821a8002ba/0_6_4485_2691/master/4485.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7ff36c2f46b7458847c1e1c21b993fff","title":"nasa to change harmful and discriminatory planet and galaxy nicknames","story":"Space agency says ‘certain cosmic nicknames are insensitive’ and vows to drop any reference to themNasa has signaled it is joining the social justice movement by changing unofficial and potentially contentious names used by the scientific community for distant cosmic objects and systems such as planets, galaxies and nebulae.In a statement last week, the space agency said that as the “community works to identify and address systemic discrimination and inequality in all aspects of the field, it has become clear that certain cosmic nicknames are not only insensitive, but can be actively harmful”.Nasa added that it is “examining its use of unofficial terminology for cosmic objects as part of its commitment to ersity, equity, and inclusion”.One of the steps Nasa would immediately take would be to drop references to planetary nebula NGC 2392 known as the “Eskimo Nebula”, a dying Sun-like star that is blowing off its outer layers. “Eskimo”, the agency said, “is widely viewed as a colonial term with a racist history, imposed on the indigenous people of Arctic regions.”It will also cease to refer to a pair of spiral galaxies, NGC 4567 and NGC 4568, in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster referred to as the “Siamese Twins Galaxy”, as part of its effort to align cosmic objects with current thinking and conventions.“These nicknames and terms may have historical or culture connotations that are objectionable or unwelcoming, and Nasa is strongly committed to addressing them,” said Stephen Shih, associate administrator for ersity and equal opportunity at Nasa. “Science depends on erse contributions, and benefits everyone, so this means we must make it inclusive.”In future, Nasa said it will use only the official, International Astronomical Union designations in cases where nicknames are inappropriate. Cosmic objects, such as Barnard 33, nicknamed “the Horsehead Nebula” would be retain their names.The “Siamese Twin Galaxy” was so-named by Frederick William Herschel, the British, German-born astronomer and composer. Herschel also identified and named the “Eskimo Nebula” which he described in January 1787 as “a star 9th magnitude with a pretty bright middle, nebulosity equally dispersed all around. A very remarkable phenomenon.”Herschel then spent nine years surveying the heavens for double stars, publishing catalogues of nebulae in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects). Among Herschel’s achievements was to note a new object in the constellation of Gemini.It was confirmed to be a new planet, named Uranus, and considered to be the first planet to be discovered since antiquity. He also identified the planet’s moons, Titania and Oberon, as well as Enceladus and Mimas, both moons of Saturn.But his nomenclature will now fall from official use at the US agency, said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of Nasa’s science mission directorate in Washington.“Our goal is that all names are aligned with our values of ersity and inclusion, and we’ll proactively work with the scientific community to help ensure that. Science is for everyone, and every facet of our work needs to reflect that value,” Zurbuchen said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f8ab2f651cf072dc8dcc60401042c6e03c81fb/0_0_3822_2293/master/3822.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=eef116c78e12f97086245a6fec36ddb0","title":"tell us how have uk childrens services been during the pandemic","story":"There have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown across the countryThere have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, with schools, GPs and other settings where they might be referred to other services largely closed.The mental health charity Mind has said that referrals to children’s mental health services have gone down significantly during lockdown, meaning treatment providers could face a significant backlog.

Because, he says, it’s time for action, not foot-dragging, and he is now out of step with his government bosses“The last four years have felt pretty momentous,” says David Isaac, who left his position as chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission on Saturday. “There’s Brexit, there’s the pandemic, there’s Grenfell, Windrush, #MeToo, and George Floyd and Black Lives Matter.”Not to mention the commission’s unprecedented investigations into allegations of antisemitism within the Labour party and the Home Office’s hostile environment immigration policy, the results of which are pending.Isaac took over two months before the Brexit referendum but now finds himself surplus to requirements because the government wants someone who, as he describes it, is “more like their agenda”.A government spokeswoman puts it another way: “It is usual for chairs to change periodically to allow new perspectives and fresh thinking on issues.”That the chair of the watchdog is a political appointment highlights what critics say is its limited independence.Not only does the government fund the commission, it appoints its commissioners, of which there are currently 10. Astonishingly, the commission currently has no black commissioners.He points out that the entire commission – an umbrella organisation set up to protect the rights of marginalised sectors of society including disabled people, BAME communities, women and LGBTQ+ groups – now has a budget of just £17m, a fraction of the £70m it had at its peak and £2m less than the Commission for Racial Equality alone was allocated in 2006. “Inevitably it means we can do less,” Isaac said.The rise of Black Lives Matter has been seen by some as evidence of just how much less, with the commission accused of failing in its duty to promote racial equality.But Isaac defended the commission’s record on race, pointing out its successes fighting discrimination on a case-by-case basis. The death of George Floyd, which has sparked worldwide protests, has, though, he acknowledged, become a tipping point.“The nation has started to talk about Black Lives Matter and the issues arising from that in a way that I don’t think we were talking about things even in March.”The government’s response to the emergence of BLM – it is setting up a new commission on race and ethnic disparities to “improve our evidence base to change lives for the better,” the spokeswoman explained – is a foot-dragging exercise, Isaac believes.“I’ve said to government that the time for making recommendations is over. There’s a coherent strategy we’ve set out, a lot of the data already exists and we want government to take action.”But the “big, unspoken” issue in the debate about race, Isaac said, was how it related to “inequality of opportunity and poverty”, and he lamented the fact that the commission does not have the power to investigate such factors.In Scotland, public bodies now have a legal duty to consider socioeconomic factors when making decisions about how they allocate resources.The government spokeswoman said ministers did not believe the act should be used “as a means of social engineering, which would ultimately have significant cost burdens for the public sector”. But the urgent need to examine socioeconomic inequalities has been made stark during the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the health of low-paid workers, many of whom have not been furloughed and have had no choice but to work during lockdown.“The very people saving lives on the frontline and keeping our shops open and buses running are people who have less positive outcomes in terms of education and the workplace,” Isaac said.The pandemic has also exposed the vulnerability of disabled people. “I’ve been shocked in my four years to see quite how badly treated disabled people are in this country. They are treated as second-class citizens, whether it’s in relation to education or employment. Covid has made things much worse.”It’s a pretty bleak picture, but Isaac is keen to take the long view.“We’re in a very different place in this country to where we were when the equality and race legislation was set up in the 1970s. But because everyone is shouting and seeing this as a competition for rights, it’s quite difficult to acknowledge that we’ve made huge progress and to deal with the more nuanced positions. It’s all bundled together in these very extreme positions.”Positions that are unlikely to become less extreme any time soon as the profound social tensions which first erupted during Brexit continue to play out. A problem for Isaac’s successor, whoever the government chooses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c75a6e2a8c76088c41b9d069c1ec86776d6ac3/0_71_5095_3057/master/5095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce0bec30ff2b292b756684510489b41e","title":"us pga golf championship 2020 third round live","story":"A dramatic end to a dramatic Moving Day. If tomorrow is half as good, we’ll be in for a treat. My guess: tomorrow will be twice as good, so you won’t want to be anywhere else! Hope you’ll join us, and thanks so much for reading this report. Nighty night!Fleetwood rolls his birdie putt straight into the cup, no messing. And suddenly the picture looks so much brighter for Southport’s finest! Two birdies in the last three holes, and a non-event of a round has been salvaged. A level-par 70 that keeps him right in the hunt! Hopefully we’ll see much more of him tomorrow, eh?Li sends a delicious chip down to kick-in distance with soft hands. Given the rocking his mental equilibrium will have taken after that dreadful stroke of luck at 13, losing his ball up a tree, that’s shown real character. He won’t be happy with his 73, of course, but he’s still in with a shout at -5, and may prefer to hunt rather than be hunted tomorrow afternoon. Li’s second goes just over the back of 18. Only just into the rough. Not far from where Day was, it shouldn’t be a problem to get that up and down for his par. Fleetwood meanwhile finds the centre of the green, onto the top tier where the flag is, and he’ll have a fairly straight 15-foot putt for his birdie.Day’s just off the back, in fact, on the fringe. He nearly drains a 25-footer for birdie, but he’ll make par and sign for a 70. Level par isn’t exactly what you want on Moving Day, but having been off his game, he’ll take it. He looks cheerful enough. He’s -6. And it’s a par for Berger, whose putter went a little cold today. He’s shot a level-par 70 too, and remains in with a very good shout at -6.Both of the final groups are now on 18. The penultimate pairing, Day and Berger, both get to the dancefloor in two strokes. Back on the tee, Li and Tommy Fleetwood prepare to drive. Both are at -5, and while we’ve followed Li round, Fleetwood has been practically invisible to the cameras. That’s because he achieved nothing of note, apart from bogeys at 3 and 10, until birdie at 16. But while he’s been out of sight and mind, he’s not out of this tournament, and a birdie at the last would change the look of this round completely. He splits the fairway. Li finds the fringe on the left, a fairly fortunate outcome since he didn’t catch his drive at all, the ball only just getting over the water.Justin Rose gives himself a straight 15-foot birdie chance on 18, but doesn’t hit it. It’s never going in. That’s a 70, which he’d have probably taken after an awful start that threatened for a little while to totally derail his round. He remains at -6, and a second major is far from a pipe dream. Brooks Koepka is looking for number five, meanwhile, and he wastes no time in rolling home his birdie putt. A 69, and what a magnificent recovery from that 5-5-5 run that looked like scuppering his title defence. He’s -7, and will be featuring in Dustin Johnson’s dreams tonight, you can be sure of that.From the centre of 18, 170 yards out, Koepka eases his approach to five feet. That is quite magnificent, and if he knocks that in, he’ll give those above him on the leaderboard some serious pause for thought. Even if he doesn’t, he’s shown great moxie to come back from that three-hole slump that cost three shots. Li’s shortsided himself in the bunker, and does well just to splash out to 15 feet. He can’t make the par putt, and another shot goes. He’s back to -5, and four shots have gone in as many holes. As unfortunate as he was with that disappearing drive on 13, the approach shot here was abysmal. Meanwhile up on 17, Day gingerly shoves his birdie putt wide right, a real opportunity to make more ground on the leaders gone.Day looks revived by that birdie on 16. He swishes his tee shot at the par-three 17th pin high to 12 feet. He’ll have a good look at another birdie. Meanwhile on 18, Koepka lashes a frustrated drive down the middle. Working out a few things there. And up on the green, Cameron Champ can’t believe his Srixon doesn’t drop, rolled straight at the cup from 20 feet, but somehow screeching to a halt one dimple short. He’s fuming, but once the smoke clears, he’ll be content with a fine 67 that’s put him right in contention for his maiden major. He’s -8.Li’s nerves get the better of him at 16. From the middle of the fairway, 90 yards out, a sand wedge in hand, he takes an absolute age over his shot. Brooks Koepka would most certainly not approve. He pays for his dilly-dallying. After a very nervous smile to his caddy, and a fair amount of twitching, he pulls his ball into the bunker front left. Oh dear. Nothing’s happened for Jason Day since birdie at the opening hole. Apart from a couple of bogeys, at 6 and 9, that is. But he’s been grinding it out, and after a long run of pars, he rattles a 30-footer across 16 and into the cup for his second birdie of the day. He’s back to where he started: -6. He throws his arms open, cocks his head back, and shouts YES! before laughing at his struggles. He’s still in fine fettle. Don’t rule the 2015 champ out. His partner Daniel Berger isn’t quite so cheery as his short birdie putt lips out. He remains at -6.Koepka sends a 9-iron over the flag at 17. He’ll have a straight 20-footer coming back for another birdie. Rose follows him on and will have a look from about 30 feet. Up on 18, Casey makes his par, and that’s a superb save after a poor drive. Pars all the way home, and he’ll be more than happy with his 68. He’ll be tucked just behind the leaders tomorrow at -7.Koepka makes his birdie putt, and he’s back to -6. A decent response to three consecutive bogeys. Rose tidies up and remains at -6. On 18, Casey can only hack out from the thick rough, but he screws his third to five feet and has a good chance of scrambling his par.Two putts for Champ. Par. He remains at -8, one off DJ’s lead. Koepka nearly drives 16, then chips up to four feet. Chance for birdie. Rose won’t get one, though he’s out of position on the right, and hits an overhanging branch with his second. But his third chip is sensational, clipped to a couple of feet. He’ll save his par.Champ sends his tee shot at 17 over the flag. He’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet. On 18, Casey sends his drive into thick stuff down the left. Berger has a birdie chance on 15 but he pulls it left and remains at -6. Koepka’s partner Rose bogeys too, the result of a careless three-putt. He’s back to -6. And the pressure is beginning to tell, as Li, on the edge of the 14th in two, underhits a chip woefully. That leads to another bogey, and he drops to -6, though he’s so unlucky his 25-foot par saver didn’t drop, stopping one dimple away from dropping. It just required one more joule of energy. Maybe a joule he left out on the range during that absurd six-hour practice stint last night?Koepka very nearly chips in to escape with par, but that’s another shot gone. Three bogeys in a row, and he’s slipped all the way back to -5. He’s occasionally prone to this: his near-collapse at Bethpage Black last year, his dismal start to his final round at Portrush in the Open. Time to regroup. To be fair, he almost always bounces back.Koepka is getting extremely ragged. He sends his second at 15 over the back, then flubs his chip up. He’s still in the thick stuff, albeit by the fringe now. If he doesn’t pull himself together quickly, he could play himself out of contention this afternoon. Especially as, up on 18, Johnson two-putts for par and signs for an excellent 65. He was back in 31 strokes, such a fine response to that double-bogey at 9. He’s the tournament and clubhouse leader at -9. Last year’s runner-up could be ready to right some wrongs tomorrow!Dustin sends his second at 18 to the fringe near the back of the green. The pin’s on that top ridge, so he’s in good nick. Li sends his drive at 14 left this time, an over-correction in the wake of the disaster on 13, and nearly finds a penalty area. But it stops short of that bother, and Li laughs wryly. Dustin has bogeyed the 18th twice this week, but he’s started well here, larruping a monster drive down the middle. Two putts for Li on 13, meanwhile, and it’s a double-bogey six. That doesn’t look great on paper, but what a level-headed response to an awful stroke of luck. To (effectively) par the hole with his second ball ensured he only dropped two strokes and remains very much in the mix. That may stand him in good stead, should he keep it together for the rest of the round. Champ does well, too, to gather himself on 15 and flop to four feet, limiting his own damage to bogey.Champ is clearly rattled, and sends his third, a wedge, over the back of 15 and into thick nonsense. Li finds the middle of 13 with his fourth and should limit the damage to double bogey. Meanwhile it’s all happening, because it’s back-to-back bogeys for Koepka, the latest at 14, and he slips to -6. Suddenly the defending champion is three offLi hits a fine second tee shot he’ll be hitting his fourth from the fairway. And up on 17, adding to the narrative, Dustin Johnson rakes in a 30-foot birdie putt on 17, and snatches a share of the lead at -9! He’ll almost certainly have that to himself in a few minutes, once Li and Champ are done.If Li was fortunate on 12, he’s desperately unlucky on 13. It writes itself. His ball sailed into the trees down the right, and nobody saw it drop. He takes three minutes to look for it ... but it’s lost. He’s got to go back to the tee and hit three from there. Such a sad moment. Champ, by contrast, has a decent lie to the right of 15 ... but he whips a weird one into the sky and the ball only travels 20 yards or so into more rough! Not sure what happened there. He either hit some overhanging branches, or got right under it. The ball did seem to have a puffy lie, so the latter could be more likely. Some major-championship pressure being felt, right here!Both leaders send their next tee shots wide right, Champ at 15, Li dramatically so at 13. No lucky bounce for Li this time. Goodness knows how Moving Day is going to end, never mind the tournament itself.Li does even better than make par! He putts down the hill and the right-to-left curler embarks on an unerring journey towards the cup. As it disappears from sight, he raises both arms in mock triumph before covering his mouth and guffawing loudly. Birdie! He knows he really got away with one there ... but he took advantage of a couple of huge breaks, and that’s the sort of thing that could convince a man this is his time! Birdie for Champ at 14, mind, so Li doesn’t get the moment to himself.A couple of great bounces for Li on 12! A wild tee shot looks headed for the cart path down the right, but it snags a tree and drops into the semi-rough. His second looks pulled left of the green, but it skips over the bunker and rolls down a hill towards the putting surface. He’s not on, but he’s close to the tucked-away pin, and should save his par from there. Meanwhile Scheffler throws his arms out in agony as he misses a short par putt on the last. He’s still signing for a superb 65, one shy of Fleetwood and Champ’s best-of-week mark. But there goes sole ownership of the lead. Meanwhile dropped strokes for Koepka at 13 (poor chip) and Berger at 12 (poor putt) and here’s how the top of this ever-changing leaderboard looks ...DJ curls in a 30-footer on 15, and that’s back-to-back birdies. He rises to the ever-expanding group in second spot ... but Paul Casey lets a chance to do the same slip by at 14, leaving a 12-footer on the high side.Tony Finau is a dimple away from making birdie at the last, but it’s just a par and he signs for a 67. He’s nicely placed at -6, and unlike a few likely to end the day ahead of him, at least has experience of the heat of major-championship Sunday.Koepka makes birdie at 12. No fuss, no drama. A stroll. On such a tricky hole too, the pin tucked away at the back. He lasered it to 12 feet. He moves up to -8, a shot off Scheffler’s lead. As for the leader himself, he cracks his drive at 18 into the trap to the left of the fairway. That shouldn’t be a problem, many a player has found the green from that spot this week.Scheffler becomes the first to reach nine under! He clacks a lovely tee shot at 17 to 20 feet, and strokes in the putt. Few mentioned the 24-year-old from Dallas at the start of the week, though there he was in plain sight, having tied for 15th at the WGC St Jude last weekend with four rounds under 70. He’s not under the radar now.The birdies keep on coming! Another for Scheffler, this time at the short par-four 16th, reward for a 30-foot tramliner. Back-to-back birdies, and he’s got a share of the lead! Then on 14, Dustin Johnson recovers from a slightly wild drive down the right by wedging to eight feet and rolling in the putt. He’s one off! And Champ sails his second to 12 feet at 12, the pin tucked away at the back, setting himself up for birdie and share! This leaderboard is wonderfully absurd.Tony Finau has been quiet for a while, but he’s just drained a 60-foot birdie putt across 17 to move up to -6. Birdie for Scottie Scheffler at 15, and he’s back to -7. Daniel Berger birdies 10 to return to -7. And another birdie for Justin Rose, who curls in a 25-foot left-to-right putt on 11. Perfectly paced, in that it only just dropped, stalling for a nanosecond on the lip before disappearing. What a tease. He’s -7 too, and this is a fantastic comeback by Rose, who was all over the shop at the start of this round.Champ fumes as he three-putts the 11th to drop out of the lead. Koepka isn’t much happier as he’s limited to par on the easy par-five 10th, out of position from the get-go. But his partner Rose makes his birdie and he’s back to -6. However the real scenes are on the 18th green, the front of which Bryson DeChambeau has only just found. He’s faced with a snaking 100-foot putt up a ridge ... and looks around in stunned amazement as it clatters into the hole! Birdie! That’ll make for a sound sleep this evening, and he’s signing for a 66 that brings him right into this tournament at -6!It’s not quite happened for Jason Day after his fast start with birdie at 1. Bogey at 6, and now an uncertain prod at a six-footer on 9 ships another shot. He turns in 36 and slips to -5. His playing partner Daniel Berger misses a short par putt too, and drops to -6. The minute they vacate the hole, Li whip-cracks a glorious iron straight at the flag from 190 yards. It’s maybe 15 feet from the cup, and on this difficult hole is worthy of the “wow” his caddy greets it with.Collin Morikawa pars the last, and signs for a wonderful 65. He’s the new clubhouse leader at -7. That’s one off the tournament leader Li Haotong, who has just been joined at -8 by Cameron Champ, making birdie at 10.Li pulls his tee shot at 8 into the thick stuff to the left of the green. He whips to eight feet, a decent result from where he found himself. He makes the par putt, although the ball wiped its feet before dropping, but that’s a fine up and down, and he pumps the air with great determination. He remains one in front at -8. Meanwhile up on the par-three 17th, DeChambeau misses left, then hits a hot chip past the cup and off the other side. A bogey that brings him back down to -5.Xander Schauffele dropped off the radar early today with bogeys at 1 and 3. But he’s since birdied 4, 7, 10 and now 11, rattling in a 30-footer, and suddenly he’s back up to -6. A reminder: six top-ten major finishes for the young Californian out of 11 starts.Scrub that. Li Haotong creams a 5-wood to the edge of the short par-four 7th. A chip and a putt, and he retakes sole ownership of the lead at -8. He should soon after be joined by Casey, but he manages to three-putt from the fringe at the par-five 10th, having gotten far too excited over an eagle effort. He remains at -7, and that’s a huge opportunity squandered.“Fucking thing!” Koepka’s drive at 9 finds the second cut down the left. Wayne Riley apologises for “some nasty language” at 12.30am in the morning. We truly are through the looking glass. Meanwhile it’s two birdies in three holes for DeChambeau, at 14 and 16, and he’s been quietly mooching up the leaderboard, joining the crowd at -6. This is preposterous! There are 19 players within two shots of the lead! Who’s going to win this fucking thing, then, eh? (Sorry, it was an open goal.)Three birdies in a row for the in-form Collin Morikawa! The 23-year-old from Vegas rolls a 15-footer into the cup at the par-three 17th, and he grabs a share. This is going to go to a play-off tomorrow, isn’t it? Yes.Here we go! Collin Morikawa makes back-to-back birdies at 15 and 16, and he’s suddenly -6. Justin Rose rolls in a 30-footer for birdie on 8 and he’s back up to -5. His partner Brooks Koepka shortsides himself at the par-three but whips high into the air and lands softly by the cup to save his shot. He remains at -7.Tell you what. Birdies are at a premium at the minute. Players are having to battle for their pars. The group of current clubhouse leaders at -3 - Patrick Cantlay, Ian Poulter, Webb Simpson, Jon Rahm - could be forgiven for thinking they’ll be in a very decent position when it all comes down this evening. Can anyone out on the course make a decisive move?Paul Casey snatches a share of the lead! Following up from his chip-in at 8, he whistles his second at 9 to ten feet and cleans up. He’s out in 33, and could this be the 43-year-old Englishman’s time at last? He’s -7.Li is always struggling after that wayward tee shot on 5. He punches up to the edge of the green, but he leaves his third a good 12 feet short, and it leads to his second bogey of the week. He then flays his tee shot at 6 into the rough down the right, and this is a little wobble. Meanwhile Champ gets up and down from sand at the side of 7, Day and Berger both drop one at 6 and it’s all change at the top of a congested leaderboard.On the short par-four 7th, Brooks Koepka sends his tee shot into a greenside bunker on the right. As it sailed off target, he muttered a wee curse word. The F word. Eff. Fuck. “Apologies for any language you might have heard there,” says Sky Sports announcer Nick Dougherty. It’s 12.04 in the morning. The poor guy’s only doing his job, but ... is there really any need? Eff and Jeff away, Brooks, it’s long after the watershed, the kiddies are in bed, we’re all grown-ups.It wouldn’t be a major championship without a Dustin Johnson double, and here we go. He makes a rare old horlicks of the long par-four 9th, always out of position after a wayward tee shot. Bunker trouble, followed by a not particularly distinguished chip, and he clatters back to -5. Meanwhile Paul Casey holes out from a bunker at 8 for birdie he’s -6.The wind has picked up, the greens are getting harder, the birdies have dried up a bit. Bogey for Scheffler at 11 he’s back to -6. Li drives towards the trees down the left of 5. Koepka dunks his approach at 6 into thick nonsense at the back of the green. But Lanto Griffin bucks the current trend, following up his earlier birdie at 4 with another at 7. He’s -6.Rose’s ball stays on the fringe, and he lags up well from 50 feet or so. But that’s still his third five in the opening five holes, and another bogey. He’s back at -4 again, and you have to wonder whether yesterday’s sad events at Wentworth, where a nearby fire caused the Rose Ladies Series Grand Final to be abandoned, have taken their toll.A two-putt birdie for Berger on the par-five 4th, and he’s the latest to join the gaggle at -7. Scheffler remains stuck there, having only parred 10, a hole that’s been giving up eagles never mind birdies. Meanwhile more problems for Rose, this time at 5. A poor approach sends his ball down a swale at the back of the green. He’s not got much green in front of the hole to chip back up onto. He opens the face of his club for a flop and ... thins it. Not sure whether that’s gone off the other side of the green, as the director cuts away to spare his blushes, but even if it’s stayed on, it’ll be a monster putt coming back for par.An incredibly poor tee shot at the par-three 3rd by Fleetwood. It’s wide right and a long way short of the putting surface. His chip up isn’t much cop either, and he’s left with a long par rake coming back. He can’t make it. He’s -5. Li pars. Up on 7, Dustin underhits an eagle putt from the fringe but not so badly that he can’t tidy up for birdie. He’s back to -7. Birdie for Tony Finau at 10, which moves him back to -6 after a dropped shot at 9. Birdie for Paul Casey at 5 he’s -6. And Joel Dahmen follows eagle at 10 with bogey. He’s -6.Koepka saunters up the par-five 4th and makes a birdie without any fuss. He joins the group at -7. Meanwhile up on 18, McIlroy taps in for ... bogey. And that followed bogey at 17. Probably just as well the cameras weren’t trained on him. It’s a 71, and his game really is in a strange place right now. It’s not in a complete Jordan Spieth style muddle ... but it’s not exactly functioning properly either. He’s level par, with some thinking to do ahead of tomorrow, never mind next month’s US Open.So having said Li looked a little more settled, he leaves his 25-foot birdie putt five short. But he tidies up, showing no nerves with the par putt. Hard to say whether this is a good sign or bad. Too early. Still just one bogey all week for the young Chinese star, though. Fleetwood also pars. Meanwhile on 4, birdie for Champ, who passes Dustin Johnson going the other way, the big man bogeying 6 after a wild tee shot. And it’s all change at the top, because Joel Dahmen, a man who wrings every drop out of life having had his health problems in the past, drains a big eagle putt across 10 to join the group in second! Imagine if he hadn’t imploded with that triple-bogey on his last hole last night!Morikawa slips at 12, having sent his approach wide right. Chipping from thick rough, he couldn’t hold the green, and the bogey takes him back to -5. Meanwhile Scheffler pars the long 9th and hits the turn in 31, while Li appears to have settled any nerves with a couple of calms swipes down 2. He’s on in regulation, which despite his wayward work off the tee, has been his MO this week: yesterday he made 14 out of 18 greens in regulation.More frustration for Rose, as he sends his tee shot at 3 over the flag, but watches in despair as his 20-footer coming back turns away just before it reaches the cup. Par, which at least steadies the ship. Rose continues to walk about with a comic-book black cloud over his head, as his second at 2 flies hot through the green. He can’t get up and down from cabbage, and it’s a dismal start for Hampshire’s finest. Pars for Fleetwood and Li at 1. After a cracking drive, Li played the rest of the hole in a slightly shaky fashion, coming up short with both wedge and first putt. No wonder, perhaps: he’s the first player outside the world 100 to hold a 36-hole lead at a major since Ricky Barnes at Bethpage Black in the 2009 Open. Barnes led after 54-holes in that event, too, before having a shocker on the front nine in the final round, ending with a 76 that gifted the prize to Lucas Glover. Everyone wanted a resurgent David Duval to win that day, if memory serves, but I digress.Up on the green, Jason Day opens with a birdie. He made that hole look extremely easy. He snatches second place to himself ... for about 0.0002345 seconds. Dustin Johnson makes it three birdies in four holes at 5 to join him, then Scottie Scheffler chips in on 8. That’s four birdies in five for the 24-year-old from Texas. Meanwhile up on 16, Rory refuses to throw in the towel, despite the hammer blow of those bogeys at 13 and 14. A birdie at 16, and he’s hanging on in there. Just."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c63b0838718c352fa9a93c54525444ce2664612/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=becdc24a293eaad9e76f3f4ea639f1ef","title":"why uk farmers are cashing in on the boom in rural staycations","story":"Landowners turn to camping and cottage rentals to boost income after lockdown losses Jonathan Simper is busy preparing his family’s idyllic farm on the sandy shores of the River Deben in Suffolk for the influx of weekend campers.“We are in a beautiful place, down by the estuary,” he says. “We are fully booked this weekend.”Simper is one of many farmers taking advantage of the boom in staycations by opening a campsite to boost revenues and put their businesses on firmer footings before the removal of EU agricultural subsidies, as well as an expected downturn.The property agency Savills, which advises landowners moving into the tourism and leisure sectors, says the pandemic has accelerated existing holiday trends, with many more farmers and estates ersifying their businesses to cater for increasing numbers of tourists opting for camping, glamping sites and holiday cottages in the UK.Simon Foster, Savills’ director of tourism, says that these are likely to be long-lasting changes: “Our view is that it’s here to stay,” he says.“People are looking for somewhere safe, secure, secluded, where they can hunker down for a week, rather than staying in a big resort or a big caravan park or hotel.“That trend for rural holiday accommodation, whether it be glamping or cottages, has gone through the roof in the last month or two – and will continue to remain strong.”James Smith from the Cool Camping website estimates that there are twice as many new camping sites this year than last, with many of them on farmland. “Places are so booked up that people are struggling to find anywhere,” he says. “There are a lot of businesses that are seeing this as an opportunity and setting up sites pretty quickly.”Simper, 54, decided to open the 70-pitch campsite after the government temporarily relaxed planning rules, allowing landowners to open sites for 36 days without planning permission. He hopes that the venture will make up for the farm’s losses during lockdown.“It’s been a very difficult year,” he says, “We are fishermen as well as farmers. We stopped fishing for quite a while. We grow asparagus and our major customer is a wholesaler that sells to London restaurants, which were all closed.” Nick Moore is another farmer running a successful pop-up campsite for the first time. He opened a 10-acre meadow to campers on his beef farm, which sits on the edge of the New Forest National Park in Hampshire. “We are flat out at the moment,” he says as he oversees the Friday changeover of campers. “We are fully booked every weekend and even the mid-weeks are starting to fill out.”Moore, 55, had been looking for alternative revenue streams for the farm ahead of Brexit. “The industry is undergoing a lot of change as we leave the EU,” he says. “We thought we’d give this a try.”He plans to open the site again next year: “We are planning on doing this every year from now on.”Other farmers have also had to change their ersification strategies quickly to cash in on the staycation boom. Charlie Taylor, 40, and his two brothers switched from using their farm in Banbury, Oxfordshire, as a wedding venue to a glamping site when all their 39 wedding bookings were cancelled or postponed. “We modelled cash flow and that went down pretty low so we decided we’d better do something,” he says. The site’s eight bell-tents and single shepherd-hut are fully booked each weekend in August. But the brothers, who grow crops and rear sheep, will still be down year on year. “It is peanuts in the grand scheme of things,” says Taylor. “One wedding gives us £10,000 whereas the bell-tent income is about £11,000 in total – we are expecting £25,000 when all is said and done.”Large country estates are also planning to invest in the new holiday accommodation. Rupert Bathurst, the fourth Viscount Bledisloe, who owns the Lydney Park Estate in the Forest of Dean, is considering adding shepherd huts and a two-bedroom treehouse to the grounds. “There clearly is a much bigger appetite for country stays,” he says. “We already got a converted water station. I’m very keen on building a water tower on stilts up in the woods to continue industrial water theme. People are looking for a story and fun rather than just a box.”Bathurst, whose family has farmed Lydney for generations, says that the estate needs to ersify as it is far too dependent on fluctuating milk prices, which fell when cafes and restaurants closed. “Our businesses have been hit quite badly. We were looking at getting 30p per litre for our milk. We got 24p because the demand just wasn’t there.”Back in Sussex, Simper is already taking bookings for next August. He loves sharing his beautiful home with campers: “I am much more gregarious than most farmers. I love talking to people. I enjoy it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ff5b4e0ff38685c524b65eebd358e55b6ea45c/0_261_4667_2801/master/4667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70dde7a55743d6c2f209e04b5709efee","title":"us election interference russia china iran intelligence","story":"Statement says China is opposed to Trump but offers more concrete evidence of Russia’s efforts to undermine BidenRussia is backing Donald Trump, China is supporting Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to sow chaos in the US presidential election, a top intelligence official has warned in a sobering assessment of foreign meddling.The statement on Friday by William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, raises fears of a repeat of the 2016 election, when Russia manipulated social media to help Trump and hurt his opponent Hillary Clinton.“Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment’,” Evanina said. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia.”Evanina identified Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician, as “spreading claims about corruption – including through publicized leaked phone calls” to attack Biden’s campaign. The Washington Post reported that Derkach has met repeatedly with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has pushed conspiracy theories about the former vice-president.Evanina also warned that some “Kremlin-linked actors” were spreading false claims about corruption to undermine Biden, while others were trying to “boost President Trump’s candidacy via social media and Russian television”.Evanina, the top intelligence official monitoring threats to the election, is a Trump appointee. His statement lists China before Russia but presents less specific evidence of direct interference by Beijing.“We assess that China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win re-election,” Evanina said. “China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.”He added: “Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race.”Evanina highlighted China’s criticism of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the closure of China’s consulate in Houston and the White House responses to Chinese actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea. On Friday, the US imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 other senior officials. Trump has also ordered crackdowns on the Chinese owners of the popular apps TikTok and WeChat.Iran, meanwhile, was seeking to undermine US democratic institutions and Trump, and to ide the country ahead of the 2020 elections, Evanina’s statement said.“Iran’s efforts along these lines probably will focus on on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content. Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s reelection would result in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.”Trump pulled the US out of a nuclear deal agreed by Barack Obama and imposed various sanctions on Tehran.The anti-Trump pressure group National Security Action denied that China’s public actions rose to the level of Russia’s covert election interference. “Jarringly, the statement attempted to minimize what Russia is doing – again attacking our democracy in a bid to secure Trump’s reelection – by comparing it to China’s public criticism of the administration’s recent punitive measures against Beijing,” a spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “Any interference in our democracy is unacceptable, but there is no equivalence between the two efforts.”In a press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday evening, Trump reacted to the assessment by insisting: “I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.“China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to ‘Sleepy’ Joe Biden. They would own our country. If Joe Biden was president, China would own our country ... Iran would love to see me not be president.”The president added: “I’ll make this statement. If and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly. We’ll make deals with North Korea very quickly. Whatever happened to the war in North Korea? You haven’t seen that, have you?”A hacking and social media campaign by Russia in 2016 is credited by US intelligence with helping Trump to victory. It triggered the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which described Russian meddling but did not conclude that there had been direct collusion by Trump or his campaign.The November election is already under siege from the coronavirus pandemic, concerns over whether the system can handle a surge in mail-in voting and constant attacks by Trump on the integrity of the process.Evanina warned that foreign adversaries may try to interfere with election systems by trying to sabotage the voting process, stealing election data or questioning the validity of results: “Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.”The report raised concern on Capitol Hill. Marco Rubio and Mark Warner, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said they “encourage political leaders on all sides to refrain from weaponizing intelligence matters for political gain”.Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said: “It is no surprise our adversaries have preferences in our elections.

It offers rural communities support to take a stand against racism at a local level.The online toolkit was launched on Saturday with a protest along the banks of the River Colne in Essex.“This toolkit is about getting people who are not racist to become anti-racist, especially for people who live in rural areas who might be thinking we don’t have that much racism around here,” said Gurpreet Sidhu, founder of the Wivenhoe Black Lives Matter group and co-organiser of the protest.“Racism is everywhere and there are people in your community who often suffer in silence.” The toolkit, developed by Wivenhoe BLM supporters with help from Stand up to Racism Colchester and the Local Equality Commission, provides resources on how to start a campaign in a rural setting, describing some of the key challenges as well as ways to overcome this. It is targeted at white people in rural areas who want to stand up against racism but might not know where to start.It includes information on how to hold a protest, run educational events and create action plans.Having organised a BLM demonstration in rural Gloucestershire during the pandemic, Khady Gueye, from the Forest of Dean, was able to support Sidhu in creating a resource for people to share experiences and ask questions.“In rural areas like mine, there is this idea that we don’t need things like this because there isn’t a big ethnic minority population, but there is a lot of covert racism,” she said.“People need a platform to share their experiences of racism and prejudice in these areas, where you’re in a much more extreme minority than in bigger cities, and people who don’t really understand need a place to start in trying to engage with and tackle these problems.”Gueye, 24, said having an open dialogue and sharing resources help to create change. “Especially in places where there’s little to no exposure to people of different ethnicities and cultures, people need a platform where they can ask questions, have those difficult conversations, and be pointed towards books, articles, films, podcasts – whatever it is – to give them an insight into racial injustice and prejudice. They need somewhere to begin.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46d65b95c34c39c1d001d50d67007159fa90015/0_232_5430_3260/master/5430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dec6d2f809c07fbdc2a516ff9b62ae99","title":"indian food delivery company zomato offers period leave to women","story":"Employer aims to remove stigma in a nation where menstruation is still taboo to some Indian food delivery company Zomato has said it will give female employees up to 10 days of “period leave” a year, as part of an effort to combat what it said was stigma around the issue.Zomato is the most high-profile organisation to institute the policy in India, a country where menstruation is still taboo to some.“There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma attached to applying for a period leave,” Zomato’s chief executive, Deepinder Goyal, said in an email to staff on Saturday.“You should feel free to tell people on internal groups, or emails that you are on your period leave for the day.”Founded in 2008, Gurugram-based Zomato is one of India’s best-known companies, with more than 5,000 employees.Millions of women and girls in India still face discrimination and health issues due to a lack of awareness surrounding menstruation.In 2018, India’s supreme court overturned a decades-long ban on women of menstrual age entering the Sabarimala temple in the southern state of Kerala, leading to a nationwide debate about women’s rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea142c3946e2491f6d3c3525300d80eb86dcb96/0_127_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fbe543c7082c026098690f4b3c47e526","title":"only half of britons would definitely have covid 19 vaccination","story":"Survey sparks concern over misconceptions about vaccines and scepticism about science The study found vaccine rejection was strongest among those  whose beliefs reflect greater scepticism about science and who are less concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Likely refusal was also linked to those who tended to be less willing to wear face masks and who said they got most of their information about the disease from WhatsApp and other social media outlets.The trends revealed by the study – which was based on 2,237 interviews with UK residents aged 16-75 and which was carried out online in mid-July – have triggered dismay among scientists. “Misperceptions about vaccines are among our most directly damaging beliefs, and they’re clearly influencing people’s intentions during the coronavirus crisis,” said prof Bobby Duffy, director of King’s College London’s the Policy Institute, which led the study.“While one in six in the UK say they are unlikely to or definitely won’t get a potential vaccine against Covid-19, this rises to around a third or more among certain groups, with a clear link to belief in conspiracy theories and mistrust of government, authority and science.”This point was backed by Gideon Skinner, research director at Ipsos Mori. “Almost a quarter of 16-34-year-olds are saying they’re unlikely to get vaccinated for Covid-19 if one becomes available. That is deeply concerning and should serve as an important staging post for the government to combat misperceptions about vaccinations, particularly among young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71390b51aafec7768e5b212486b2f68b0d8207d/0_0_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2eb9714c1bd22bc0fc5f6578d526bbd","title":"coronavirus live news us nears 5m cases as australian border closures ramp up","story":"US approaches horrific milestone Australian border restrictions tighten as state of Victoria reports 17 dead Brazil passes 100,000 deathsOwen Alexander, a recent law graduate who lives in Flemington in Melbourne’s inner city, went for a position in a call centre for the Australian Tax Office. He was told they had received about 5,000 applicants, and didn’t get the job.“It really makes you start to feel bad about yourself,” he says. “You’re reading job descriptions for things you don’t actually want to do, knowing the pay is terrible, knowing you’re probably not even going to get an interview.“It constantly chips away at your self-esteem. It’s probably been the hardest part of this lockdown. Earlier on you might have thought things were going to get better, but now you sort of wonder. It’s hard to be optimistic.”Across the country, thousands of the newly unemployed are living in the fallout of those abstract numbers. Read the full story here:AAP: A new Alcohol and Drug Foundation survey has found one in 12 Australians have been drinking every day since the coronavirus outbreak began.The foundation quizzed more than 1,000 people, with a concerning number reporting they were drinking more than usual.One in 10 people reported consuming more than 10 standard drinks per week, increasing the risk of alcohol-related injury and diseases such as cancer.Nearly one in five people said they wished they’d drunk less during the Covid-19 lockdown, with half hoping to cut down in the future.Until there’s a vaccine Coatsworth says everyone needs to keep up the good hygiene practises developed, and social distancing.“And we must continue to encourage our friends and family. I saw reports today that there are clearly members of the community that do not engage in traditional media or even social media. There are doubtless many millions of Australians that don’t necessarily watch Dr Nick Coatsworth press conferences on a Sunday afternoon, but with one or two degrees of separation and the community engagement. So for example, if you are a mother or a father whose teenager or 20-year-old doesn’t appear to be getting the message, then now is of course the time to encourage them.He doesn’t have national data on whether that’s replicated around the country but he’s going to take it on board.For those of us who aren’t in Victoria at the moment, it’s really difficult to imagine how challenging this is,” he says. “Having been sensitised to it in the first wave, to then be in a situation that you have to go through it again and then some in those areas that have stage four restrictions is going to produce a whole range of undesirable effects and one of those is clearly in the mental health space.”He says the extra funding announcements by state and federal governments are good, but we have to make sure people can and will access the services. As well as services like the Black Dog Institute and Beyond Blue, your local GP is “your port of call”.There are some people who won’t be accessing those and the people we are most concerned about are the people who either haven’t recognised the mental health consequences for themselves or people that don’t know how to access services or are afraid of accessing services. And for those again - I’ll go back to what I said at the start of the press conference, that’s where community has to be part of this. That’s where friends and family have to changes in people and reach out and be aware those services are there.”Some cautious optimism from the deputy chief medical officer.“I think the challenging thing about Covid is you never really know where you are on the curve,” he says.But there is relative confidence about where Victoria is, because the reproductive number over the past few days has been one or just below one.“It appears we’re on the plateau. We’re looking for the inflection point that tells Victorians that their efforts are being rewarded, that we see numbers going down. And we haven’t seen that yet, but I have no doubt we will see it. If you consider that stage three restrictions had a sort of almost at a plateau, then the stage four restrictions will produce a result. The extent of that result really depends on how low that reproductive number can be brought, and the ideal situation would be if we could see the reproductive number at 0.5. We don’t have enough data at the moment from the numbers to see whether that’s approaching 0.5. But hopefully in the coming days to weeks we will see that.Australia’s CovidSafe app (which has been... isive, to say the least) is working much better than it used to, says Coatsworth.It’s not identifying many extra contacts for Victorian cases, largely because everyone’s in lockdown and they know who they’ve seen (very few people) and where they’ve been (very few places).But in NSW the app has been much more successful.“Why is that the case that we’ve suddenly gone from an app that appeared not to be working to one that is? The first thing to say is the app was always letting off its digital signals and pinging. There have been updates and improvements to the algorithms that others could describe more fully. That’s undoubtedly had an effect. Finally we see what happens when you have an essentially open economy as you do in New South Wales. And that’s where COVIDSafe comes into its own.Coatsworth is asked about the fatality rate in Australia. He says he hasn’t seen the data in the last week or two but Australia has generally been better than much of the rest of the world.The reasons include the already high standard of Australian health care and in particular intensive care units and staff. Dr Nick Coatsworth, deputy chief medical officer in Australia is giving a national briefing.Nationally in Australia there are 295 dead from Covid-19, and 658 currently hospitalised with 51 in intensive care.On Friday the national cabinet considered the Aus govt’s vaccine and treatment approach.“It demonstrates the need during this pandemic to not just focus on the now... and plan for the medium and long term,” he says, including the key issue of procurement, manufacture, and distribution of a vaccine.It is not going to be acceptable for any single country to have the vaccine and Australia is joining with a number of different countries around the world through the initiative to ensure that any vaccine that is developed is available.He says there are a number of Australian vaccine candidates currently at the sate of human trials, including one by the University of Queensland, and one developed by Flinders University and the Adelaide company vaccine and two developed by international companies. India: AP reports that seven coronavirus patients have died in a fire that broke out early on Sunday at a hotel being used as a Covid-19 facility, officials said, in the second such incident this month.The blaze at Hotel Swarna Palace in the city of Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh state started at 5am.

I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity.

But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThere is more than a touch of groundhog day about the news of serious outbreaks of Covid-19 in a number of food processing plants in the midlands.Clusters of the disease in these fertile environments for transmitting the virus were a feature of the crisis phase of our pandemic, several months ago.It seemed the problem had been dealt with, but now this. Have we learned anything?It is disquieting, too, given the mass of existing international evidence pointing to meat factories as one of the most dangerous places for the spread of the disease. Back in June, for example, more than 1,500 workers at Tönnies, Germany’s biggest pig slaughterer, tested positive.Have we not learned from the experience of other countries? Is this similar to our failure to pick up on the danger signs coming from nursing homes in other countries last February, a lack of alertness that had such a disastrous outcome?While Ireland is experiencing a surge in clusters in meat factories, the German plant has reopened after its owners installed new ventilation systems, implemented weekly testing of staff and put an end to risky employment practices such as the subcontracting of labour.Would we be experiencing these outbreaks if similar changes had been made pre-emptively across the sector here? It’s difficult to be certain, but it’s hard not to suspect that Ireland’s softly-softly approach to surveillance and enforcement is contributing to the problem.Almost six months since we started grappling with the pandemic, we know we have done some things well the lockdown stopped the virus in its tracks and the health service geared up effectively to deal with the surge in cases.We didn’t manage to protect the vulnerable and so possibly hundreds of older people in nursing home died unnecessarily, and horribly. We weren’t alone there in international terms, but that’s hardly a comfort to grieving families.Being just outside the top 10 globally for Covid-19 deaths relative to population is nothing to boast about, but at least we eventually got a firm grip of the pandemic and new cases fell to a trickle for several months.That has given us time to catch our breath, to work out what works in fighting the virus and to prepare for what is to come as society opens up and winter approaches.That cases are rising again is no surprise to public health officials, who are better informed and better armed to deal with this threat than they were six months ago.It may be simpler in infection control terms to impose blanket restrictions but it is economically ruinous. No amount of money-printing and subventions can hide the zombification of much of the economy. A new approach is needed.Pass the chiselIt may be that public health officials don’t trust people to continue to comply as much as they have up to now. Or it may be because they don’t have the teeth to enforce specific rules. Either way, we’re relying too heavily on the sledgehammer when the chisel is needed.Throughout the summer, circular arguments about travel restrictions and green lists have dominated debate, while the elephants in the room, the Common Travel Area with the UK and the ease with which travellers can come from the US, have been ignored.The US and the UK are two of our closest partners and they have both had a terrible pandemic. Their potential contribution to the importation of cases is greater than most other countries. Yet citizens of both countries are free to wander into the Republic, without even having to self-isolate if they cross from Northern Ireland.Ironically, travel has played no major role in the resurgence of Covid-19, with home-grown cases mostly responsible.Testing and contact tracing are the key weapons in tackling fresh surges of the virus. We don’t know whether our current 15,000-a-day capacity is sufficient because by the time it was built up, the number of new cases had fallen away.It’s now said to be a next-day service for the delivery of results after the test is carried out, but there are still anecdotal reports of longer waits.The average time to complete all calls when tracing contacts of a case is 1.2 days. Yet up to a quarter of contacts fail to show for a free test on “day zero” and up to half don’t show for a further test seven days later. The words “leaky sieve” come to mind.Pooled samplesA new approach to testing might see more pooled testing, where samples from an entire neighbourhood, or factory, or school, are collected. If the pooled sample is clear, good if it isn’t, the virus is present and inidual testing is required.Many rapid tests have been developed and could have a role, in spite of doubts about their reliability. Anyone testing positive on a one-hour test, for example, could be sent forward for the more comprehensive PCR test, while self-isolating.Despite the precariousness of the current situation, there is no going back to the full lockdown of last March. We know now what works to stop the virus: distance, hand hygiene, masks. We know where the risky environments are: crowded indoor spaces, meat plants, shared accommodation.We need now to continue to protect the vulnerable, and to develop targeted strategies that “build a wall” around the current outbreaks.However, there is as yet no reason not to keep moving towards the restoration of a low-risk society where people can try to restore their economic fortunes while staying healthy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Of new infections, 118 are linked to Kildare, Laois and Offaly, says acting medical chiefGlynn says there is no guarantee restrictions in these counties will be lifted after two weeksWill the restrictions be policed in the same way as during the national lockdown?Anger across the midlands: \u0026lsquoThere was outbreaks in Dublin, they didn\u0026rsquot shut the place\u0026rsquoMet \u0026Eacuteireann forecasts sunny, mild weather for most of next week, as UK basks in heatwaveJudge refuses bail to Keith Quinn and Andrew Noonan due to serious nature of chargesScale of Covid-19 outbreaks meant there was concern they could quickly spread widely\u0026lsquoWhen he returned from the forest, everyone applauded\u0026rsquo: Man retrieves laptop in chaseAnimal welfare groups express concern that stolen dogs offered for sale onlineIrish Refugee Council criticises safety standards for asylum centresPapers exchanged during government formation talks reviewed frequent-flyer levyMinister told Covid-19 pandemic to have an impact on delivery of broadband planCycle priority and one-way traffic lanes to benefit locals not tourists, council saysBusiness owners in Tullamore are worried, and some are angry about \u0026lsquoanti-rural bias\u0026rsquoRoute to be single lane for 2.5km as part of Sutton to Sandycove cycle projectSurveillance and enforcement must improve, but another lockdown is no answerSecond takeover of independent hospital sector unlikely in any new coronavirus surgeMove criticised as \u0026lsquoblunt instrument\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquodraconian\u0026rsquo by local TD Charlie FlanaganGarda checkpoints to enforce new travel limits, cafes and pubs to close for two weeksStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324967.1596824046!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"midlands lockdown why shut down offaly and leave dublin open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCathy Anne and Paul Bell outside The Brewery Tap, Tullamore, Co Offaly.

The Government can’t continue the supports indefinitely.”During the height of the pandemic, Grennan sold more fresh meat cuts to people who were, unusually, cooking at home all the time, but the butcher’s ready-meal business was “completely wiped out”.“I’m trying hard to find a silver lining, but the silver is pretty thin,” he says. “I can see a lot of unemployment in the months ahead. A lot of jobs are going to have to go because demand isn’t there.”In The Brewery Tap pub on O’Connor Square, Paul Bell and his wife, Cathy-Anne, nervously wait for news. “Locally, the feeling is that the biggest numbers are in Dublin and Kildare, ” says Paul. “Why shut down Offaly now and leave Dublin open?”The couple have had strict rules in place since they reopened. Besides taking temperatures and names, customers are asked to place their own mask in a provided envelope during meals so it does not contaminate the table.“I think they should go back to the 5km restriction.

In fairness there is a great sense of community spirit in the town.”Community spiritAbdul Hafiz, proprietor and chef at Cafe India, worries that new restrictions would damage confidence at a time when “people are barely gaining their confidence about sitting in a restaurant”.“We were lucky that we remained open all through the lockdown, unlike some of our friends who did not have a takeaway trade. The transition from restaurant to takeaway was harder for them.”However, Hafiz is hopeful that the town’s community spirit will remain intact. “It’s a small town so every body knows everybody and we support each other.”On High Street, Anthony Kearns of Guy Clothing complains of an anti-rural bias. “There are serious issues in Laois, Offaly and Kildare, but no more than there was in Dublin six weeks ago. Nobody has locked down Dublin or Cork or Limerick. ”If everyone practises safe hygiene and keeps their distance, the virus can be contained, says Kearns, who owns three shops, employing 26 people: “It’s not as if it’s all over Tullamore or Edenderry or Birr, ” he says.John Ryan of Midland Books, the sole local supplier for school books, says people have got used to living with masks, social distancing and hand sanitisers. “We felt we were on top of it,” he says. “So, it would be a big blow to us now if any restrictions were to come in. We don’t feel we are high-risk, we feel we are able to keep our customers and ourselves safe.

Public health officials were deeply concerned over the scale of the outbreaks in the midlands. Photograph: Collins Public health experts warned the Government that the scale of the Covid-19 outbreaks in the midlands threatened to spread “much more widely” in the region over the coming days and weeks.In a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Friday setting out the reasons for recommending the introduction of new measures, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said a tightening of restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly was “proportionate” and “necessary now” to curb the surge in transmissions. The same measures “could apply to any other region in the future”, added Dr Glynn, who is also chair of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). In the letter, which informed the Cabinet’s decision to reimpose tough restrictions on the three counties and which has been seen by The , Dr Glynn said there has been a change in the progression of the disease since late June. NPHET has been watching the shifting trends “with growing concern” culminating most recently in a sharp rise in infections over the last week. Cases had more than doubled over the period with “several significant and large clusters” in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, Dr Glynn said in the letter. To illustrate the gravity of the midlands surge, he noted the epidemiological incidence - the number of confirmed cases per population - for coronavirus in Ireland over the last 14 days was 9.6 per 100,000 people. In Kildare, that figure is 61.6 per 100,000 in Laois it is 62.6 per 100,000 and in Offaly it is 46.2 per 100,000. There have been 150 new confirmed infections in Kildare over the past two weeks 55 in Laois and 36 in Offaly. Dr Glynn pointed out a high proportion of the confirmed cases are among those aged under 45 years. In Kildare, 75 per cent of cases are under 45 years in Laois it is 93 per cent and in Offaly the figure is 65 per cent. Until now, hospitalisations, critical care admissions, nursing home cases and deaths were not showing any worrying trends in the three counties, but because of the age profile of cases, NPHET is worried there could be a “delay” in the spread to older and more vulnerable sections of the population in the midlands. The vast majority of cases in the region were transmitted through close contact with a confirmed case: Kildare 94 per cent Laois 91 per cent and Offaly 71 per cent. There were currently “few cases” as a result of community transmission, Dr Glynn noted. Nonetheless, there are “significant concerns” in NPHET as all the relevant indicators were showing a “significant and increasing level of disease” in the three counties. Given the scale of outbreaks there is a “real risk that this could spread much more widely in the community in the coming days and weeks”, Dr Glynn told Mr Donnelly. Advising on a tightening of restrictions for two weeks, he said the situation could be “reviewed” at that stage.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Crack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325002.1596827530!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british cash for northern ireland shows scale of brexit disruption","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish cabinet office minister Michael Gove visited the Ulster Carpets factory in Co Armagh on Friday in the course of his visit to Northern Ireland. Photograph: Press EyePA WireAn announcement of £650 million in funding for Northern Ireland was proclaimed by the British government as a “major . . . investment” and statement of London’s “commitment” to the people and businesses there. But dig into the numbers and the spin is apparent.Of the headline figure, £300 million is peace funding that had already been pledged back in January 2019, to continue joint projects with the European Union.The rest is spending on new import procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain and the rest of the non-EU world that is only necessary due to Brexit. It could therefore be presented as a cost to the taxpayer rather than a bonus.Beneath the rather disingenuous packaging, there is some substance that industry figures in the North have welcomed – though with caveats.In all, £200 million is dedicated to setting up and running for two years a trader support service, which is essentially designed to take care of import procedures and their associated costs that businesses would otherwise have to shoulder themselves.What happens after the two years and the £200 million ends is currently uncertain, but British sources insisted it was intended as an ongoing commitment.The remainder of the money is for the IT systems that would support the service “to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined”, according to the British government.The trader support service does not cover everything. It does not include import VAT obligations, and would not cover the most onerous kind of check, the sanitary and phytosanitary controls that are required to prevent any threats to plant, animal or human health from goods of plant or animal origin.It also does not cover export health certificates, required to export animals or animal products from Britain into the North or the EU from January. It’s for businesses only, so it does not include sales of goods from Britain to private iniduals in Northern Ireland, such as through online shopping.There are also numerous things that are yet to be settled. Whether or not businesses will be faced with the onerous tariff schedule of the World Trade Organisation on trade with Britain depends on if a deal can be reached on time.ExemptionBritain is hoping to get the EU to agree to an exemption for major supermarket chains in Northern Ireland from the need to comply with the sea border checks, arguing that such big companies can be trusted to keep goods from leaking into the Republic, and easily caught if they were not.Northern Ireland is the poorest part of the UK any step to avoid additional costs being passed on to consumers who cannot afford them is positive.The issue raises the question of whether the Irish Government’s arrangements will be equivalent in alleviating costs for businesses in the Republic.Any uneven situation between north and south creates incentives for smuggling and bad actors, and competition to businesses that do everything above board.Customs formalities will apply on all goods entering the whole island from Britain as of January, whether a deal is signed or not.In addition, all traders with Britain will need an economic operators registration and identification number issued by the EU.The figure of £200 million for two years indicates the scale of cost that also faces businesses in the Republic from January, without the daunting prospect of tariffs if no deal is reached on top.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The most telling comparison is with nations whose predicament is closest to ours. Enormous countries, such as China, Brazil and the US, are not closely comparable. Nor are much poorer countries, or more thinly populated ones.The natural comparisons are Western European, and even here, there are important differences. The Scandinavian countries, with their small, well-extended populations, are not so close to the British experience, although we should learn from their medical systems. The nearest comparisons, surely, are quite densely populated neighbours with roughly similar populations and GDP, urban concentrations and large international airports. That means France, Italy, Germany and, perhaps, Spain.The eventual Covid-19 post-mortem will no doubt unearth mistakes that are uniquely British, but if you look at the story so far, you will see that neither Britain, France, Italy, or Spain has done markedly better than one another. In deaths per million of the population – a more meaningful comparator than total numbers – we, at 684, are the worst of these four but the others are bad too (Italy 582, France 462. Plucky little Belgium, by the way, seems to be the world’s worst, at 851). The only one in a different league is Germany, at 110.Why might this be? First, Germany had the “luck” to get an early case of the coronavirus. A female business traveller from Shanghai arrived on January 16 and fell ill with the virus. She was treated at the Munich Schwabing Hospital. A consequent cluster of 16 cases was identified. On February 13, at the country’s Science Media Centre, a huge press conference reported the scientific findings in detail. The press release warned that “every day the spread is not controlled, the likelihood that the epidemic will develop into a pandemic increases”.But the mere fact of a disease being identified does not mean the authorities know what to do about it. The Germans did. I am no expert on Germany, but here are a few factors.Expertise. The Munich hospital has a special unit for highly contagious life-threatening infections. Its chief physician spoke at the press conference. So did the professor who had developed one of the first tests for Covid-19, as did the president of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the government’s public health institute. Lockdown was quicker than in Britain, but less draconian and more targeted.Testing (mainly for flu) is a more established part of life in Germany than in Britain. It has gone on apace throughout Covid. Also, where the NHS closed down, the normal German health system kept going. Patients with Covid were not, as they were here, told to stay at home unaided. They were constantly monitored. If their oxygen levels dropped too low, they were admitted to hospital. The needs of care homes were not ignored. No patient was sent to a care home unless it could provide 14 days’ quarantine.Media. Far more German journalists are well acquainted with science than are their British counterparts. They give the public clearer facts and fewer scare stories.Dispersal. Unlike Britain, Germany is a country of many different centres, with associated airports – Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and so on, rather than London, London and more London. So there was less danger of a sudden explosion of the plague.A related fact is that the country is federal. Sixteen states, rather than the central government, are responsible for most aspects of health care. This sometimes slows things down, but it also means that, compared with Britain, there is more local “buy-in”, more local players who get going, rather than waiting upon a distant bureaucracy.This creates a good spread of service across Germany. There were plenty of labs for testing, for example, in plenty of places. There was no appalling rush. When Britain finally got round to test and trace, the Government commissioned Serco to run it from a single call centre in Scotland. As the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, points out, you are more likely to comply with tracing from a knowledgeable employee of your county council than a call from a student hundreds of miles away. In Germany, the “corona-detectors” are a respected body of local experts.Good politics. Many in Britain have grown rather fed up with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, what with her ambiguous speeches and her hostility to Brexit. Her star has gradually waned even at home. Nevertheless, she is a scientist by training and an experienced, steady person. She can command respect in the crisis, precisely because she is not, in any detailed sense, in charge of Covid policy. Rather than having to pretend she has all the answers, she can exercise moral authority.Mrs Merkel is in this enviable position because – astonishing to British eyes – she runs a country in which health care is not usually high on the list of political controversies. In Britain, the health secretary – currently Matt Hancock – has to run all hospitals and the fifth largest workforce in the world. At the same time, he has to spend days in the House of Commons being assailed by accusations that he is trying to “sell off” the NHS and similar nonsense. The German health minister (an able man called Jens Spahn) has infinitely less power, but – no offence to Mr Hancock – can do more practical good. His role has not been to try to run a vast, unmanageable empire, but simply to oil the wheels of a system which already works, by putting in more government money – covering the costs of testing, and paying for ICU beds to be kept available.Why is Germany free of what Mr Hunt calls “the political poison” of our system? Not because Germans don’t care about health – they actually spend a higher proportion of their GDP on it than we do, and they have better health outcomes. It is because they have never bought the doctrine that a particular health care system is sacred.The origins of good health care for ordinary Germans lie in mutual funds in the 19th century, set up to help pay for funerals. These developed into much more sophisticated, competing systems of health insurance, underwritten by the state, but not run by it. Employer and employee both contribute. An unemployed person has his health care paid for in his unemployment insurance. Almost no German citizen falls through the net.The providers are also various. Government-run hospitals are outnumbered by privately run ones and others run by charities (many, for instance by the Order of St John). Because the money follows the patient, the providers have good incentives to provide. Indeed, the problem in Germany is too many hospital beds.In Britain, the health service is an object of high emotion. Behind the praise often lies a fear that it is precarious. In Germany, there is little emotional commitment to the service – rather as, here, there is little intense feeling for Sainsbury’s or Waitrose. Instead of high emotion, there is a high level of confidence. This may help explain why so many more Germans than British have returned to work, although Covid numbers jump upwards from time to time. Psychologically and medically, the German way is better for the national health than is the thing we call the National Health Service.Do you agree that the German health service is better than the NHS?

Inevitably, the suggested changes have heralded a burst of tut-tutting from NIMBYs everywhere. In some ways, I don’t blame them. It does not take John Ruskin’s aesthetic sensibility to discern the common factor of many recent developments – their extraordinary ugliness. But the naysayers should give these reforms a fighting chance. We need a serious rethink not just to fix our rigged housing market, but also to save capitalism from the Left.Ours is an unwieldy and unpredictable system in which everything can hinge on expertise in gaming the system, or blind luck. Opponents of reform cite the oft‑repeated factoid that nine out of 10 planning applications succeed, ignoring the reality that the process is so complex and costly to navigate that only a fool would proceed with an application without an overwhelming chance of success. Predictably, smaller builders and self-builders have been frozen out. This doesn’t just dampen house-building, it also explains much apparently dysfunctional practice elsewhere in the system.All this presents something of a dilemma for Right-wingers. UK home ownership rates are now among the lowest in Europe. This should trouble any conservative, for we are not Germany, where renting is the norm. The hearth fire and the home acre are central to our national sense of self. Without the prospect of rootedness, the next generation of Tories will not emerge.Yet conservatives also value their surroundings. They have recoiled as the nihilism and relativism infecting art since Marcel Duchamp’s famous urinal first outraged public taste – and quickly bled into architecture. We live with the catastrophic by‑products of a world-view that sees no objective beauty standards and believes function should supersede form. The tower blocks erected in the postwar period have become dilapidated blights on the landscape miserable Soviet-style structures somewhere between the Slough HQ of paper manufacturer Wernham Hogg from The Office and a toaster. Given the quality, how can we trust liberalisation not to yield more of the same?The answer lies in beauty. Hearteningly, the Government’s new white paper aims to embed an aesthetic element in the planning system, continuing the work of the late Sir Roger Scruton. The modernist idea that buildings should stand out from their surroundings has, paradoxically, destroyed any real inidualism. Though it may reflect the vision of the artist, it is at the same time undemocratic imposed on the world by those whose taste does not reflect majority preference.The proposals would allow distinctly beautiful developments to be fast-tracked. Locals would also be able to insist on a design standard for the area – so if Georgian terraces or Art Deco dominate, then future builds should be in sympathy with the existing vibe, in scale and design. Simply making the system more competitive would yield less identikit ugliness.If done properly, these proposals could echo the building boom that helped rescue Britain from depression in the Thirties, and the opportunities are immense. Covid-19 may drive changes in our work patterns that will leave many office blocks redundant. We could repurpose these buildings for housing, but many are hideous. We should never be afraid to knock down unloved structures and start again. Just as communities could be given greater say in the design of new buildings, they should also be empowered to earmark local eyesores for demolition.This might help restore vital trust. Given the atrocities of recent decades and many architects’ and planners’ continuing disdain for the aesthetic, it will not be easy. Just last week, the Architects’ Journal released a report backed by no fewer than 12 Stirling Prize winners, warning against the destruction of Sixties tower blocks on the basis that they hadn’t yet repaid their “carbon debt”. “We’ve got to stop mindlessly pulling buildings down,” writes managing director Will Hurst. I quite agree, Will we must mindfully pull down as many such carbuncles as we can.“Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share,” Scruton famously wrote. “Good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created… the work of destruction is quick, easy, and exhilarating the work of creation slow, laborious, and dull.” However slow, laborious or dull it may be, we must begin building beautifully once again, if we are to bequeath anything of value to future generations – including a free-market economy.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"belarus stay at home mum takes europes last dictator","story":"Three decades after the fall of the Soviet Union, Belarus lives and breathes its Soviet legacy: there is scant privately owned property in the nation of 9.5 million people, 80 percent of the economy is in state hands, and a statue of Vladimir Lenin still takes pride of place the main square of the capital Minsk.For the only time since he was first elected in 1994, Alexander Lukashenko, a 65-year old former collective farm boss, dubbed Europe’s last dictator, faces a formidable challenge at the polls. Until just a few months ago, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, 37, was a stay-at-home mum, and she is a reluctant politician.This year’s presidential campaign that culminates in the elections on Sunday has galvanised even Mr Lukashenko’s former supporters and government functionaries. Mikalay Lysyankou, for example, was proud of being appointed director of a collective farm in the town of Stoubtsy at the age of 26. But he has come to realise that the Soviet way in which agriculture is still run in Belarus is just not working.“A collective farm in Belarus now is the same as a collective farm in the Soviet Union in the 1980s,” he told The . “Our president got stuck in the 1980s, and he wants our country to stay there.”Unlike Russia or Ukraine, Belarus did not go through painful reforms to build a fully functioning market economy. Thanks to Russia’s cheap energy imports, President Lukashenko was able to sustain Soviet-style governance with free but poor quality healthcare or cheap, state-owned canteens at often economically unviable state factories.But the country’s ingrained corruption and Soviet-like bureaucracy has been dragging it down.  Belarusians face a choice: put up with measly salaries at state companies - the average monthly salary is about £370 - or go to work abroad.In the town of Stoubtsy, population 17,000, “the only good job you can get is the advertised work in Poland,” according to Mr Lysyankou. He speaks of dozens of friends who left for Poland as seasonal workers in the last year or two.Hundreds lined the streets this spring to sign up with opposition candidates. Tens of thousands came to protest at rallies in small towns that had never seen any political activism.“Several things are at play right now: a tough economic situation, life is getting harder for Belarusians as well as Lukashenko’s inaction during the coronavirus crisis,” Ales Bialiatski, a veteran human rights activist who spent three years in jail, told The .When the Covid-19 pandemic struck Belarus, President Lukashenko laughed at the danger. He even mocked the country’s first coronavirus victim for being obese and failing to take good care of himself. No lockdown was ordered, nor restrictions imposed as the the Belarusian leader insisted he needed to put the economy first.His flagrant denial of the pandemic’s scale when the country’s hospitals were overwhelmed was a tipping point for many, including the town of Stoubtsy. “This is what pushed people onto the streets to protest… when he said that money matters more than people’s lives,” said Mr Lyasyankou.This weekend, Belarus counted 68,576 Covid-19 cases. That is on par with neighbouring Ukraine which has four times the population.By the time Belarusian election officials registered four candidates to run against Mr Lukashenko, his three main rivals had been sidelined. In a sign of desperation to retain his 26-year grip on power, he said on Tuesday that he was not going to give away Belarus to anyone.Siarhei Tsikhanousky, a popular YouTuber, was sent to prison for assaulting a police officer at a campaign rally after the policeman fell down in a crowd.  Banker Viktar Babaryka was jailed over alleged financial crimes. Valery Tsepkala, a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States, was told more than half of his supporters’ signatures were forged and barred from running.Mr Lukashenko’s only opponent who was allowed to seek office, then, is Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. She decided to stand after her husband, the jailed blogger, was disqualified.Mr Tsepkala, who fled Belarus fearing arrest and spoke by phone from Ukraine, said: “Lukashenko got scared of us, men, and he was sure that he can beat Sviatlana because she has no political experience.” The former English teacher and stay-at-home mum received threats about her children and was close to abandoning her bid. But she managed to send her 10-year old son and 5-year old daughter out of the country before she launched her campaign.Mrs Tsikhanousky, a softly spoken woman, told The : “It was a thing I did for love. Everything in this country is based on fear. I’ve been feeling scared every day. I wake every morning and I want to give up. I have my cry and I move on.”She has teamed up with Mr Babaryka’s campaign manager, a 38-year-old musician, and the 49-year old wife of disqualified candidate Tsepkala, a Microsoft executive in Belarus. Together, the three women mounted an impressive campaign, attracting rallies in small towns that had never before seen any opposition activity. They drew 60,000 to an event in Minsk last week, the country’s largest rally since the fall of the Soviet Union.President Lukashenko, who has a history of accusing foreign powers of plotting to topple him, has dismissed the three women as “wretched girls” co-opted by those who take their orders from Russia, Belarus’ closest ally. To seasoned observers, that seems rich, coming from the man who has relied on Russian subsidies and cheap energy imports to prop up his rule.He claimed last week that authorities uncovered a plot by 33 Russian mercenaries arriving in Belarus to foment unrest. Russia denies the accusations.In his annual address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Lukashenko, who said he had recovered from Covid-19, looked visibly flustered - and sounded desperate. Capping a fortnight of touring military bases and calling on troops to clamp down on opposition demonstrations, he warned that pro-democracy activists are plotting to “organise a massacre” in Minsk.Mr Bialiatski said: “Lukashenko was livid: he realises that he stands not only against the usual, narrow opposition circles but that the number of those who want change is now millions and millions. This is not some ten thousand people that you can lock up, and he’s nervous.”Tsikhanouskaya was originally allowed to canvas. But in recent days, the authorities have started to turn down their requests for campaign venues and arrest protesters and activists. On Saturday night, on the eve of the election, her campaign manager was detained.The day after the  interviewed Mr Lysyankou, who leads the campaign for opposition candidate Siarhei Cherachen, he was also detained at a polling station where he was monitoring early voting. He was jailed for 10 days for organising an unlawful gathering.The same day, two men who put on the famous Soviet protest song “We Wait for Change!” at a municipal concert on Thursday that soon turned into an anti-government rally were arrested for breaking public order. They, too, were jailed for 10 days.Election authorities are largely expected to come out with an announcement of a landslide victory for Mr Lukashenko. It is bound to spark protests.Mrs Tsikhanouskaya, who knows the brutality with which Belarus’ plainclothes policemen handle protesters, said: “As a mum, I will never urge people to take to the streets. I don’t want this to happen. But we’re left with no choice. How else can people show their frustration?”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can stand nationalisms false promises","story":"I will give the Scottish Nationalists this – their relentless campaign to try and break up the United Kingdom has forced Unionists to focus harder on how we make our counter-argument. Too often in the past we lapsed into complacency, assuming those arguments were self-evident. Or we have relied on the clear and obvious weaknesses of separation, as if that would be enough to persuade the people of the United Kingdom to stay united. It won’t.My mission – as I take over as the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives this week – is to take on the half-baked nationalist case set out by Nicola Sturgeon by re-making the positive case for the benefits of our union, a case that is as strong now as it ever has been.The Coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated those benefits in full. Millions of workers have benefited from the UK Government’s furlough scheme, one only made possible by the country’s broad fiscal shoulders. Nobody has been asked to set out whether they are Scottish, Welsh, English or Northern Irish in order to receive prompt support. As with the healthcare support we receive from the NHS when any of us walk into a hospital in any part of the UK, that is the unquestioned, unequivocal benefit we get from a union which is blind to our nationality.In the unified support we’ve received from our NHS, and from the UK exchequer, the benefits of our Union have been undeniable these last few months.But it should not require a crisis for those benefits to be revealed to us all. And the truth is, for too long, that case has not been made. Since devolution 20 years ago, there has been a tendency in Whitehall to “devolve and forget”. Left unchecked, this is deeply dangerous and could end in the nations of the Union simply drifting apart. We can’t let this continue. We must find new ways to show that our Union is a common endeavour, held together not just by convenience, but by shared values and mutual gain.And we should set our sights higher – recognising that the benefits of a strong UK aren’t just felt by those of us who live on these islands, but across the world, too. For example, next year, Glasgow will host the UN International Climate Change Conference when global leaders will meet to debate new targets to stop potentially catastrophic climate change from wrecking our world.Here is a perfect way to show the value of our Union. While the Nationalists in Scotland can spend next year fumbling around with tedious arguments about how a currency in an independent Scotland might work, or why Scotland would want to separate from our biggest market our Unionist response should be to spend our time more usefully. We can demonstrate how a UK hosted event, based in Glasgow, can help secure the future of our planet.Equally, while Nationalists will always yearn for confrontation and endless rows with Westminster, the government of the Union should refuse to play ball. Instead, it should find more ways to work together with the governments of the UK, to improve the relationship between them, all the better to show that our Union is inclusive and in touch. This is about forging a new cooperative approach which shows that the Government wants every part of the country to benefit from our shared enterprise.We should remember why it is that the Nationalists are so keen to have these confected rows with Westminster. They want to demonstrate that the Union is unstable. And, increasingly, it’s because they know it helps distract attention from their utterly abysmal record as a government in Scotland. Over the last few days, students from across Scotland have taken to the streets to protest over the exams fiasco which the SNP has presided over this summer. The Scottish Government’s incompetence in this scandal is appalling and off the scale. Little wonder Nicola Sturgeon is keen to point at the Westminster bogeyman rather than accept responsibility for her government’s failures.We keep being told the Union is in crisis. But with a little care and attention, I believe the case for the Union will be shown over these coming years to be capable of withstanding the false promises of nationalism. I believe, instead, we can become what we’ve always been at our best – a beacon for liberal, open, democratic values, one seen right around the world. When I stand up against Scottish separation these coming months, I’m standing up for that.

Mr Johnson said the country had a moral duty to reopen schools next month. In an oped for The Mail on Sunday he said the resumption of teaching is a national priority.A-level results day is on Thursday, when officials are braced for a storm of criticism that disadvantaged children have been unfairly punished by this year’s system.  “It would create a perpetual unfairness between this year’s grades compared to past and future generations,” Mr Taylor said.He said: “There would be young people who would have most likely earned a C in an exam receiving an A grade. Lastly, it would mean such an increase in the numbers of top grades, that they would no longer be credible, something that has happened in other countries, dealing with the same circumstances.”An analysis by Ofqual has found that teachers have bumped-up predicted A-level marks by 12 per cent on average and GCSE marks by 9 per cent.Results day in Scotland on August 4 was branded a “shambles” after close to 125,000 predicted grades were downgraded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).Those from the poorest parts of Scotland were more than twice as likely to see their Highers grade lowered than those from the richest areas.However, Mr Taylor said that Ofqual’s early analysis shows that students from all backgrounds, including more disadvantaged and black, ethnic minority and Asian communities, have not been disadvantaged by this year’s grading process.When students receive their grades, the majority will be predicted by a statistical model which takes into account their past performance as well as the past three years’ of exam results at their school.The model, in conjunction with the rank order drawn up by teachers, will determine most pupils’ grades this year. One independent analysis of Ofqual\u0027s data suggests that nearly 40 per cent of A-level results could be downgraded.This would mean that when pupils are awarded their A-levels next week, almost 300,000 grades will be lower than teachers’ predictions.The analysis predicts that GCSEs will have a similar downgrade which means that close to two millions teachers’ predicted grades will be adjusted downwards.Meanwhile, private schools are reportedly seeking legal advice as they prepare for a flood of appeals from parents ahead of A-level results day.Education lawyers are said to be working with schools which could be hit with group appeals over this year’s results.Mr Taylor acknowledged that the decision to cancel A-levels and GCSE exams this year caused “great uncertainty” for pupils, adding that they have experienced a “unique disruption” to their lives.“We hope that the grades awarded will enable as many as possible to move on with their lives with the least possible difficulty,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave continue next week beaches brace another day tourists","story":"The Met Office has issued a warning that homes and businesses could be damaged by flooding, lightning and hailstones next week.Following the hot and humid weather, the Met Office issued a yellow warning for torrential rain which could develop in several areas of the country from Monday onwards.The body warned that the storms brings an added risk of cancellations of public transport and increased accidents on roads from sudden flooding.Power cuts and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost, it warned, adding that there is a chance that fast flowing or deep floodwater could be a danger to life.The thunderstorms that are forecast from Monday to Wednesday are said to be severe for several areas, although the location of the worst hit areas are not yet known.The heatwave currently sweeping the UK is due to continue towards the end of next week, as the country\u0027s beaches brace themselves for another wave of day-trippers.Temperatures are expected to hit over 30 degrees over the weekend and well into next week, particularly in the South, according to the Met Office.On Saturday, Heathrow and Kew Gardens reached a high of 36.4 degrees - making it the hottest day in August since 2003, and the fifth hottest on record.In Bournemouth, visitors were said to have arrived at the beach as early as 3am to bag the best spots.As many as 70 coastguard callouts were made before midday as thousands headed to the coast to make the most of Britain\u0027s beaches.This included 14,000 people packed on the sandy beach at Perranporth in Cornwall where 15 rescues launched were launched.The RNLI on Saturday warned about the dangers of inflatable paddle boards and kayaks being used on the UK\u0027s holiday hotspots.Steve Instance, the South West sea safety lead with the charity, said: Inflatable stand up paddle boards and kayaks can be taken by the tide and wind very, very easily.People can fall off them and get separated.

Her most-watched video is a seven-minute workout to lose belly fat.Created in 2018, the video has notched up an astonishing 75 million views - 17 million of them in the last three months alone. In the past 48 hours it has been viewed 250,000 times.Wyndham-Read, a former Army corporal turned personal trainer, posted her first YouTube video in 2012. “In the beginning, I would be lucky if I got 10 views. It took years to take off but I just never gave up.“I remember uploading the seven-minute workout - I thought it was a good workout but it was just another standard video and never, ever could I have imagined this. Then I started noticing, wow, that’s getting a lot more views. And then it just went viral,” she told the Sunday .“No one knows me, everyone knows Joe Wicks. But people started to find my workouts, got great results and it’s been word-of-mouth.”Wyndham-Read, who is in her late 40s, was bullied at school and always picked last for sports teams. It was only when she decided to join the Army and had to pass the fitness test that she began taking an interest in exercise.She left the Army in 1992 following a tragedy: her partner was accidentally killed by a fellow soldier in barracks while playing a game similar to Russian roulette.She retrained and spent the next two decades as a fitness instructor before beginning her YouTube workouts.“When I first qualified as a personal trainer I lived in Reigate and I put up flyers everywhere in the town centre and I was going to do a circuit class for free. I stood there in the hall waiting at 6pm and no-one turned up. And yet now I’ve got a  quarter of a million people in two days doing one of my videos,” Wyndham-Read said.Her audience on Facebook - where her followers dub themselves Lucy’s Squad - and YouTube has rocketed during lockdown as people try to stay fit both physically and mentally. And Wyndham-Read is careful to make her videos accessible to beginners and people of all ages.“My philosophy is that it’s got to be do-able, because I don’t want people to do it for three weeks and then stop. I want it to become their lifestyle. It’s got to be something they’re going to wake up every day and want to do.“When I did my research I looked at a lot of beginners’ workouts and thought, oh my goodness, if I was a beginner and watched a video where they were telling me to come down on the floor and do mountain climbers and press-ups, I would feel so upset and think I couldn’t do that.“So I created beginners’ workouts that are actually are designed for a beginner.”She has nearly 1,000 videos on her YouTube channel and recent ones include indoor walking workouts. Wyndham-Read said: “I was doing those prior to lockdown but they have been so useful when people couldn’t go out.“I went out and on my iPhone I filmed some beautiful pathways with a blue sky, so I could bring a bit of green space into the videos. I always created some workouts as a series - I know people like Netflix so I’ve done them in episodes.“It’s helping with health and obesity but also with things like anxiety and stress.

Bendy parsnips should be kept in the fridge and will soon perk up if slices are chopped from each end.The new guidance on how to store food safely has been published by Wrap, the Government\u0027s food waste watchdog, amid concerns that households have started to waste more food now that the lockdown is easing.Wrap said it hoped its guidance would encourage people to keep up their pre-shop planning, smart storage, and creative cooking, as well as explaining the crucial impact this will have on the planet, as well as the cost of their food shop.Research in June found that that although people have found ways to manage their food better, self-reported waste has increased by 30 per cent compared to the early stages of lockdown.The tips - published in an A to Z guide on Wrap\u0027s LoveFoodHateWaste website - could finally mean that arguments in families over where to keep foods and stop it going off.While some of it might appear obvious to  readers familiar with how to run their kitchens, the tips will be seized on by young people living alone wanting to get the most from their groceries.Among products that should be kept in the fridge are eggs - best kept in their box to protect them - and parsnips, which can then be frozen after being blanched in boiling water.Aubergines also should be kept in the fridge, but can be frozen too as long as they are sliced and grilled beforehand to stop them going mushy.Also best stored in the fridge are apples and pears - although they can be frozen if they are cut into slices and quickly cooked in boiling water first. A definite no-no for the fridge are bananas, which must be kept somewhere nice and cool, in a cupboard or on the side, ideally in their original packaging. Bananas will go black in the fridge.Other foods destined for the cupboard include red, brown and white onions that are best stored in a cool, dry, dark place, ideally in a cloth bag. Spring onions should be kept in the fridge though.Potatoes too should be left in a cool, dry, dark place, ideally in a cloth bag and away from strong-smelling foods like onions, according to the guidance.There are also tips on household budgeting, suggesting buying a big block of hard cheese to make the most of a store bargain before grating it and freezing it to eat later. Fizzy drinks should be bought in smaller quantities to avoid waste, while soft drinks that have gone flat are great for freezing into ice lollies.Wine is best stored in a cool dark place or in the fridge once opened, the guidance says, adding - perhaps optimistically - that households can freeze leftover wine in ice cube trays then store in an airtight container if there is any left.DO\u0027s - and DON\u0027Ts More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"portugal insurance demand soars britons ignore fco advice","story":"Portugal remains on the FCO\u0026#39s \u0026#39red list\u0026#39, but Britons are going anywayUK tourists ‘left in dark’ by holiday quarantine, say MPs How to get travel insurance should you choose to ignore Foreign Office adviceSign up to the  Travel newsletterFresh hope has emerged that Portugal could soon be added to the FCO\u0027s \u0027green list\u0027, according to a government source.Ministers are thought to be happy with Portgual\u0027s low infection numbers, with a Whitehall member telling The Sun: “Portugal has made a lot of progress but the process for dropping quarantine is far more gradual, where we monitor progress in weeks rather than days.”But Britons are already flouting the FCO\u0027s advice against all but essential travel, and are visiting the country anyway. There has been absolutely overwhelming demand for a new insurance package launched by Portugal\u0027s National Tourism Authority that offers medical and holiday cancellation cover for foreign visitors something that is hard to come by in the UK given Portugal\u0027s current status on its \u0027red list\u0027.Marco Pyta, commercial director for the insurance company, Bónus Seguros, told Portugal Resident on Friday that he\u0027s had to bring in a special task force to cope with the “unbelievable” number of enquiries more than 1,000 yesterday, stating: “Nintey per cent have come from England.” Scroll down for more news updates.A recap of the top stories:Ministers make \u0027progress\u0027 in dropping Portugal quarantine Huge demand for Portugal\u0027s new \u0027Covid-safe\u0027 insurance package Face maks outside are now mandatory in Saint-TropezMSC Cruises announces restart of operations in the Mediterranean  Gatwick puts terminal on ice as axe falls on thousands of BA staff British men arrested at Malaga airport for refusing to wear masksThank you for joining us and see you for more of the latest tomorrow.In Germany the government has declared certain regions in Romania and Bulgaria as risk areas after an increase in Covid-19 infections there, amid concerns about an uptick in cases across Europe. Germany\u0027s foreign ministry late last night issued a warning against travelling to the Romanian regions of Arges, Bihor, Buzau, Neamt, Ialomita, Mehedinti and Timis as well as to Bulgaria\u0027s Blagoevgrad, Dobritsch and Varna regions.Travellers entering Germany from those areas of Romania and Bulgaria, which are both members of the European Union, will face mandatory coronavirus tests.

I travelled from here to Amsterdam at the weekend and there were definitely more there who didn’t see the point of paying expensive rent in London when they could be working remotely from somewhere else. They are all in their 30s and mostly lived alone with no kids.I decided to go because I’ve always wanted to live abroad but the job situation has stopped me. Now that’s not an issue it gives me the opportunity to see what it’s like and I have some guaranteed good weather for a few months.After being in lockdown on my own and with a stressful job I also just needed a change as it was hard going mentally and I felt I needed a distraction. I haven’t been worried at all about getting home to be honest, I’m only two hours away and the cases here have been much lower then they were in the UK. I think they did a much better job of handling it.The destinations welcoming digital nomads (and which you could feasibly move to)There has been absolutely overwhelming demand for an insurance package launched by Portugal\u0027s National Tourism Authority that offers cover for foreign visitors.Given the FCO still advises against all but essential travel to Portugal, the main barrier for UK holidaymakers is the difficulty in securing insurance for their trip.But this initiative, run by a Madeira-based business, offers cover that includes medical hospital expenses “associated” with Covid-19, as well as protection against cancellations or holiday interruptions, starting at €37.20 (£33.62).Marco Pyta, commercial director for the company, Bónus Seguros, told Portugal Resident on Friday: “By midday today, I think we had received over 1,000 calls. Yesterday there were 800. We had no idea this insurance would be so popular”. Pyta has had to bring in a special task force to cope with the “unbelievable” number of enquiries. “Nintey per cent have come from England,” he says. “It’s as if everyone there wants to come on holiday to Portugal.”“Where is nearest bar-o?” – words allegedly uttered by a British holidaymaker as he was arrested in Malaga.A group of British men were arrested last night at Malaga airport following their refusal to wear masks on their inbound flight. The Spanish police were waiting in the arrivals hall to take statements from cabin crew and the men in question. One of the suspects could be heard attempting to speak Spanish to the authorities: “Me no have mask mate, me English, tourist – we all bring mucho dosho to Spain – where is nearest bar-o?”A girl on the flight, who wished to remain anonymous, told Euro Weekly: “We all knew they would be trouble when they boarded the flight. We informed the captain but we were too close to landing to ert back to the UK. The other passengers, mainly older people, didn’t want any trouble with boozed-up yobs and just sat there and played with their phones or pretended to be asleep.”Spain is currently on the list of countries from where travellers must quarantine on arrival when they return to the UK and the FCO also warns against all but essential travel to Spain.To see the latest travel advice and rules about visiting Spain, see here.Tourists today have been enjoying the lovely weather in Switzerland, on the rim of the Creux-du-Van.The Creux du Van is a natural rock arena of immense proportions, located at the border of the cantons of Neuenburg and Vaud.You\u0026#39ll need a head for heights to enjoy this forayThe death toll from an Indian passenger aircraft accident has risen to 18, while 16 people have been seriously injured, a senior government official has said today. The Air India Express plane, which was repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the coronavirus pandemic, overshot the runway of the Calicut International Airport in heavy rain near the southern city of Kozhikode yesterday. It was India\u0027s worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010.The flight was carrying 190 passengers and crew and the plane\u0027s pilot and the co-pilot were killed in the accident, K Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Malappuram district in the southern state of Kerala, told Reuters.All survivors were admitted to various hospitals and were also tested for Covid-19, Gopalakrishnan said, adding that autopsies of the dead would also be carried out according to the Covid-19 protocol.If you’re hankering after the simple joys of canal life – the really relaxing moments – then leave the routes that tout one hundred miles and one hundred locks in a week to the macho types who equate the word “holiday” with “challenge”, says Paul Miles:Instead, think of your hire boat as a cosy floating cottage from which to explore and pursue activities nearby before gently cruising on – for just an hour or three – to a new view.

Of those, 12,749 have \u0027recovered\u0027 and 389 have died of Covid-19.Health officials have said the recent uptick in cases is due to local clusters and they say hospitalisations, at 116, are well below peaks of over 400 as the government seek to avoid a national lockdown again.However, officials have cautioned that some measures taken to curb the illness are likely to return after the summer holidays when cities become more crowded again and the flu season arrives.The rising number of cases in the Czech Republic prompted Norway this week to re-impose a 10-day quarantine for travellers from the country.Seven safer destinations for a last-minute summer holidayAn absence of other tourists was a recurring theme on Sasha Vasilyuk\u0027s trip to Molise, Italy’s second smallest region, just above Puglia.Despite its historical riches and pristine landscapes, including Pietrabbondante and Saepinum, one of the best-preserved ancient Roman ruins in Italy, it is so unknown that Italians like to joke that “Molise doesn’t exist” (it rhymes in Italian).  She writes:In today’s climate, a lack of visitors is a big plus. This under-the-radar region has become one of the safest choices for Britons eager for an Italian vacation (as of Thursday, it had recorded eight cases in the previous seven days 3 per 100,000). In fact, some lucky travellers have secured a free stay in Molise this summer – in San Giovanni in Galdo, one of its many picturesque villages.Read the rest of the piece here.As of today the face mask rule has been extended in England - meaning coverings are now mandatory in the following:Indoor places of worshipMuseums and galleries Public areas in hotels and hostelsIt comes as figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that face masks are the new normal in Britain - with 96 per cent of people wearing one to leave the house.The survey, which takes in the period from July 29 to August 2, found that 96 per cent of adults who had left their homes said they had worn a face covering to slow the spread of coronavirus – up from 84 per cent last week and 71 per cent the week before that.Gabriella Swirling reports on the ONS figures here. The Natural History Museum in London reopened this weekGatwick Airport\u0027s South Terminal could remain shut until next summer, bosses warned, as British Airways launched a wave of job cuts.The country\u0027s second-largest airport this week told staff that one of its two terminals may not reopen for a year and redundancies are likely after hopes of a recovery were crushed by new travel restrictions.In a live-streamed town hall meeting with staff on Monday, chief executive Stewart Wingate said the South Terminal cannot return to full operations until carriers\u0027 schedules are restored, employees said.It came as BA began telling thousands of its workers whether they will lose their jobs in a wave of brutal cutbacks.Oliver Gill and Louis Ashworth have the full story.A melting glacier is at risk of breaking apart due to a heatwave, forcing the evacuation of part of an Italian alpine valley, reports Reuters.The alarm was raised on Wednesday when experts in helicopters realised that the Planpincieux glacier, at an altitude of about 2,800 metres in the Ferret Valley in the Mont Blanc massif, was slipping dangerously.A heatwave has created a layer of water under the glacier, which is roughly the size of the Milan cathedral, making it more prone to a break.A photo taken from a helicopter on Friday of the Planpincieux glacierAbout 75 residents and tourists in homes or hotels in hamlets in the threatened part of the valley were evacuated and police threw up roadblocks to prevent others from entering.“The season was going well despite the COVID pandemic,” Jacopo Nitri, who owns a small hotel in the area, told the Corriere. “I had to send away 25 clients and cancel some reservations.

known to friends as Skippy - advised Harry and Meghan to live together before “doing anything more serious”.A source close to Duke and Duchess of Sussex told the authors of Finding Freedom, which is being published on Tuesday, that although his advice “came from a good place”, Prince Harry “didn’t totally see it that way”. The source, who is understood to have spoken to the authors with the permission of the Duke and Duchess, added, “It really hurt him that someone he was so close to would not trust his judgment.”It has been previously revealed that Harry’s brother, Prince William, also advised him to slow down, leading to reports of a deep rift between the two.Mr Inskip and his wife Lara Hughes-Young were reportedly “punished” for expressing his reservations by being excluded from Prince Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party at Frogmore House in May 2018.According to reports last year Prince Harry and Mr Inskip were reconciled after the death of his mother-in-law last year following severe mental health problems.It was Mr Inskip who arranged the infamous 2012 Las Vegas party at which Prince Harry was caught playing naked billiards with showgirls in a hotel suite.He was also with the Prince when he was seen inhaling \u0027hippy crack\u0027 - or laughing gas - at another party.It has also been claimed that when Prince Harry and Ms Markle first began their relationship, following a blind date in July 2016 Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, had not “shown much interest” in the American actress.A source told Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal: “Despite the fact that Harry was a regular guest in her household Kate seemingly didn’t care to get to know who this woman was who had made her brother-in-law so happy.” However, this may simply have been a reflection of the fact the Duchess of Cambridge is an “extremely guarded person”.The source added: “Meghan was disappointed that she and Kate hadn’t bonded over the unique position they shared” and that Catherine felt they did not have much in common “other than the fact that they lived at Kensington Palace”.Prince Harry and Ms Markle married at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018 and went on to have a son, Archie, now 15 months.The US celebrity magazine In Touch, which reported on Saturday the claims about Mr Inskip’s reservations regarding Meghan, has earlier claimed she has “no regrets” about her and Prince Harry’s decision to move across the Atlantic in March this year. “She looks and feels amazing,” said a source, adding that the Duchess of Sussex is particularly pleased to no longer have to abide by the royal dress code. “Meghan’s gotten used to dressing down,” a source said. “On a day-to-day basis, she wears jeans or yoga pants, big sweaters and flats or sneakers, which she feels comfortable and relaxed in, and keeps her makeup minimal,” said the source.Although the Duchess is said to enjoy getting “dolled up” from time to time, she “hated” the firm’s “old-fashioned rules and regulations — like wearing dresses below the knee”.Buckingham Palace officials told The  they would not comment on the contents of the forthcoming book or on claims made by unnamed sources.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spurious social sciences have shown","story":"I’ve never had a lot of respect for social sciences, or, as much of it seems to me, political activism thinly dressed up in scientific clothes. But one of the latest offerings does seem to be an especially laughable example of the art (and I really do mean art, rather than science). In a paper published in the Lancet, a team from University College London’s Covid-19 Social Study claims that the revelations about Dominic Cummings’s trip to Durham at the height of lockdown damaged public trust in the Government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis and attitudes towards keeping the lockdown.It’s not that I challenge the conclusions – which are surely a case of stating the bleedin’ obvious. But the decision to write an entire paper around one government aide does give something of a clue to the authors’ motivations.The paper is not exactly subtle, carrying the title: the Cummings Effect: politics, trust and behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic. It reports the opinions of a sample of 40,000 members of the public, each of whom was asked to rate their confidence in the Government’s handling of the crisis on a scale on one to seven, seven being maximum confidence and one indicating no confidence at all.After May 22, when the Cummings story came out, it claims, the average fell from 5.0 to 4.5. It was definitely Cummings wot did it, the authors assert, because they measured no corresponding fall in confidence in the Scottish and Welsh governments.I’m not going to defend Cummings’s behaviour, which I am sure did have an influence on how many people viewed the Government’s handling of the crisis and their willingness to adhere to lockdown guidelines. But if you are going to study how public attitudes have changed over time, why fixate on Cummings while overlooking the numerous other public and personal events and issues which have shape people’s opinions on the extraordinary restrictions on freedom imposed on us over the past few months?The paper also includes a graph on how well people were adhering to lockdown restrictions. Unsurprisingly, it shows a steady fall from early April as people became fed up with being told to stay indoors. The graph does show a plunge after the Cummings story came to light, yet it shows an even bigger plunge after May 5 – the day that Professor Neil Fergusson was caught with his trousers down, by allowing his lover to visit him at his flat. Curiously, though, the authors don’t even mention that event, still less include Ferguson’s name in the title of the paper.Let’s pick another of the many events which might possibly have weakened public adherence to lockdown guidelines: the Black Lives Matter protests from the second weekend of June onwards, when thousands took to the streets in flagrant breach of a ban on public gatherings. How many people watched the footage of activists pulling down the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol and thought: bugger this, if they are allowed to get away with that then I bloody well am going to have the Joneses round for a barbecue?Funny enough, the study stops dead on June 11, so doesn’t have to address this. Maybe that is the subject of a follow up study called the BLM effect: how protests affected public attitudes towards lockdown. Or maybe not. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sue barker reveals old tennis coach secretly returned cash gifts","story":"She was once the darling of British tennis, winning 15 WTA Tour singles titles and the French Open in 1976 before becoming one of our best known sports presenters.But the extraordinary story behind the man who set Sue Barker on the road to sporting stardom has not been told until now. The former tennis ace, now 64, has revealed for the first time the heartwarming generosity of her former coach Arthur Roberts, who trained her as a child free of charge.Not only that, but when Ms Barker hit the big time and insisted on paying him back what she felt she owed, he simply returned the money to her father so it could be invested on her behalf.It was only years later that the star turned broadcaster realised the truth, when idends began landing on her doorstep from the investments Mr Roberts had arranged for her. Speaking to current female British number one Johanna Konta’s podcast, the Question of Sport host disclosed how she received years of free training from Mr Roberts because her parents could not afford to pay for her lessons.Explaining how she got her lucky break growing up in Torbay, Devon, she said: “There just happened to be a tennis coach in Torquay that had already coached a French Open champion and a Wimbledon semi-finalist, and he was looking for two players to take on.  “I was lucky, I was only the second one he chose so I very nearly missed out.  My parents couldn’t afford to pay for coaching - I was the youngest of three kids - so he took me under his wing and he only charged me £1 for the very first meeting I ever had with him. He refused any money.  If it hadn\u0027t have been for him I’d never have had my tennis career.”Miss Barker went on to explain how she offered to pay Mr Roberts back after she started making “good money” as she rose through the rankings to become world number three. “I was earning a couple of hundred thousand a year which back in the 1970s was huge,” she admitted. “I said: ‘I really wanna pay you some money back for all that you did for me’.”Mr Roberts reluctantly agreed and so Miss Barker paid him different sums over the course of the next few years until she retired in 1984. What she hadn’t realised is that Mr Roberts had given all the money straight back to her father.“Everything I’d given him he got my father to invest for me,” she said. “So suddenly like 10 years later, then 20 years later, then 25 years later, these bonds suddenly appeared.  “A letter arrived on my doorstep and this money. I thought, ‘Where does this money come from?’. He invested the money that I’d given him. So he ended up making me even more money.” She did not disclose the precise amount.  “He was just the most wonderful man, and without him I just wouldn’t have been able to do it, and without tennis I wouldn’t have had the second career (as a presenter) either,” she added.   “Sometimes it’s just being in the right place at the right time, and meeting the right people.”Describing Mr Roberts as “so, so special to me and such an amazing coach”, she said:  “Sometimes you don’t realise it until later on.  I knew he was fabulous and that, but I just didn’t realise how fabulous he was until later on. He coached me for nothing, but then to do that...it was almost like he continued to want me to excel in life, and he didn’t want the money.  He was really an incredible man. Then getting into television has been such a joy.”  Miss Barker, who dated the singer Cliff Richard from 1982 to 1986, initially joined Australia’s Channel 7 as a commentator and sports presenter before going on to anchor tennis for British Sky Broadcasting in 1990. She joined the Wimbledon coverage on BBC in 1993 and now anchors the two-week long broadcast for the network.She married landscape gardener and former policeman Lance Tankard in 1988 and the couple live in Gloucestershire.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/25/09/jennifer-aniston.jpg","title":"jennifer aniston friends reunion delay hbo max release date coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Special postponed yet again as America’s coronavirus cases continue to climbJennifer Aniston has reacted to news of the long-awaited Friends reunion being delayed yet again, saying she is “very sad” it’s been postponed.The unscripted HBO Max special was originally scheduled to shoot mid-March.

This has also given us more time to make it even more exciting and more fun than it would have been. So I choose to see it as the glass is half full that it got postponed.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have solved the mystery of how a 242-million-year-old reptile with a neck three times the length of its torso moved around, discovering that it lived in the ocean. Paleontologists have been puzzled ever since fossils of the creature, which is part of the Tanystropheus genus, were first discovered in 1852, as they were unable to work out how the animal could have supported the weight of its neck. The creature\u0027s bizarre body didn\u0027t make things clear one way or the other, researchers said, and its giraffe-like neck left scientists unsure over whether it lived on land or in the sea.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe puzzle was solved when a new study by the University of Zurich reconstructed the reptile\u0027s skull, revealing several very clear adaptations for life in water.Olivier Rieppel, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago and one of the authors on the study, said: That neck doesn\u0027t make sense in a terrestrial environment. It\u0027s just an awkward structure to carry around.”Cancer found in dinosaur fossil for first timeMr Rieppel described the creature as “a stubby crocodile with a very, very long neck”.The scan showed that the 20-foot reptile had nostrils on the top of its snout and curved, interlocked teeth – both indications of an animal that would have hunted in the water.Stephan Spiekman, a paleontologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and lead author on the study, said: “It likely hunted by stealthily approaching its prey in murky water using its small head and very long neck to remain hidden.”Tanystropheus fossils were discovered in on the border between Switzerland and Italy. Nearby, scientists found fossils of a creature that looked similar, but was only 4-feet long, leading them to wonder if they were juveniles or a different species.

Nick Fraser, keeper of natural sciences at National Museums Scotland and a co-author on the paper, said: It is hugely significant to discover that there were two quite separate species of this bizarrely long-necked reptile who swam and lived alongside each other in the coastal waters of the great sea of Tethys approximately 240 million years ago.Indiana Jones and Mongolia\u0027s fight to recover stolen dinosaur fossilsMr Spiekman added: These two closely related species had evolved to use different food sources in the same environment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s going to linger there until the virus dries up and dies over time.”The most common method of transmission in the UK is probably through conversations, he added.“In a pub you go there to talk, you go there to do exactly what you need to do to transmit the virus to each other,” he said.‘Complacent’ pub landlord apologises after venue linked to outbreakWhen people laugh, they produce a lot of air, so if someone in a group makes a joke, they are “massively exposed to exhaled air from the laughter around them”.Asked whether being in a busy pub was similar to being on a plane in terms of risk, he said: “It’s even worse because the aeroplane has very good ventilation.

Well you drink, and you have a conversation,” he said.“But several conversations in a confined space equals incrementally raising your voice to be heard.” Talking more loudly results in the release of more droplets which may be carrying infection.“So more droplets equals more chance of picking up one droplet that eventually infects the other person.“It is a perfect storm aided and abetted by alcohol the enabler.”Dr Pankhania pointed out that pubs attract sociable people who are likely to have met up with many others.“So they are meeting a lot of people as well as meeting you in the pub. You might be meeting them only, but you don’t know how many they have met,” he said.Even going to the pub alone is a risk because the virus could be in free circulation, he said.As for restaurants, he said: “I personally think going into a restaurant indoors where there are lots of tables etc in a confined space, without any new attention to increased ventilation, I would say it’s best you avoid it.”Additional reporting by PAUniversity of Leicester\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity of Exeter\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The lives of women hit by the state pension age rise have been turned upside down by the coronavirus pandemic, pushing some into destitution after losing their jobs in the Covid-19 crisis, while others have been forced to carry on working – despite their age putting them at risk of serious complications from the life-threatening disease.Almost 4 million women were affected by the government raising the state pension age from 60 to 66 for women born after March 1950. The age rise was accelerated in 2010 and saw women reach equality with men, at 65, in 2018.BackTo60, a campaign group calling for women to be reimbursed for pension payments they have missed due to the changes, lost its landmark High Court battle against the government – but appealed the ruling last month. Campaigners could now potentially have to wait until the autumn for a decision to be announced.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent spoke to women from across the UK affected by the controversial changes, all of whom feel they are too old to be working despite the government telling them they are too young to retire.Retired women owed millions in underpaid state pensionJanet Williams, from South Wales, found about the rise after her neighbour’s daughter told her over the garden fence. It left her feeling shocked. The 62-year-old, who has worked with adults with learning disabilities for 20 years, said her anxiety has spiralled out of control during the coronavirus crisis as she is caring for her husband and her mother – who are both at severe risk from Covid-19.She said: “My husband is 69. He’s type two diabetic and he injects insulin. My mother is 93 in two weeks. She has age-related dementia. I am keeping two houses going. Hers and ours. Both mum and my husband are vulnerable. I’ve got arthritis and I suffer from vertigo. “The week leading up to lockdown, I had severe anxiety about contracting coronavirus. Someone at work had suspected coronavirus. I had a meltdown. I went off sick with anxiety and stress. I am currently on sick pay from my company but that drops down to half pay after six months and it will go down soon. They are trying to make me go to a care home rather than working with people with learning disabilities.“I don’t want to do it. I’m worried about my mother and worried about my husband. They’ve had coronavirus at the care homes near me. Care homes are a very dangerous place at the moment. I started work at 16 and I have worked now for 46 years. I’ve never had a break from work. I always thought I’d retire at 60. I’m so stressed. I’m sleeping about four hours a night if I’m lucky, and when I do go to sleep I’m having nightmares about being made to go to work.

Equality is precious so its an insult to have this word corrupted in order to cover up the theft of women’s pensions.“Ask my partner of 40 years, if he feels equal now, after watching her partner have nearing £40,000 stolen off her at the most vulnerable time of her life. I spend a lot of time crying. It might sound weird but it’s like I don’t exist. I am a subclass. I tend to get up at 3am and 5am some nights because I can’t sleep. I wake up in the morning and ‘wonder why do you bother?’ I’ve never been like this before. I’ve always been a happy positive person. I don’t believe in anything anymore. “I cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve come very close to killing myself. But having my children stops me. It is depressing when you have no existence anymore. When you are disconnected with everything around you. You have no pension, no job, no home, no future and a past that believed in a pension that was a lie. I’m too young, according to the government, to retire and too old to work. I’m trapped between a rock and a hard place.”Surge in women claiming universal credit and out of work benefitsMichaela Hawkins, from South Wales, said she had no official notice from the Department for Work and Pensions the state pension age was being hiked up and only heard through colleagues. The 65-year-old, who previously worked with adults with learning disabilities but has been delivering food to elderly people who are vulnerable during the pandemic, said she had suffered ageism and felt like she was far too old to be working. She said: “I have feared catching coronavirus while working and then coming home and giving it to my husband. They wanted to redeploy me into care homes but my husband is shielding for health reasons. I said no because of that and because of my age as well. I am definitely too old to be working. Working with adults with learning disabilities is an amazing job but it exhausts you physically and mentally. Coronavirus and food banks: The stories behind the statistics“I’ve always been a fit and energetic person. But younger colleagues have said: ‘Isn’t it time you retire? Aren’t you too old to do this kind of job?’ My husband is 11 years older than me and I have caring responsibilities for him. We were looking forward to retiring.“We have had five years stolen from us. We would have liked to have done things together. The main thing was to spend quality time together. Our ambition was to go to the Norwegian fjords. When you come home from work, you are so tired, so weekends are taken up doing things you weren’t able to do as you were so tired. My husband says: ‘Why don’t you give up work? I say: ‘How will we live?”Stephanie Stus, who lives in Worcestershire, said she was only given 16 months notice that her state pension age was going up by six years.The 65-year-old, who works for the NHS via an agency as an ultrasound practitioner, said she lost one of her two job during the coronavirus crisis with “a minute’s notice”.Ms Stus added: “I worked in two different hospitals until 23 March when one hospital let me go. I tried to claim furlough but they don’t do it for the NHS. They assumed people would be redeployed. I can’t claim universal credit because at my age I do have savings. I have just put my house on the market because I can’t afford the mortgage anymore. I’m looking at the for sale board now.“I am struggling to get other work. I’ve applied for jobs. The other hospital did a risk assessment which said I was high risk. They said I couldn’t work with coronavirus patients. You start to feel like you are too old to be working in a pandemic. As more information became apparent, I was worried about contracting coronavirus. The stats show women over 60 are at a substantially higher risk. Of course, it makes you feel more vulnerable.“You are now told because you are 60, you are high risk for coronavirus, but you have to work until you’re 66. There were issues with the state pension age rise before we entered into a global pandemic but now they have been compounded. Of course of the youngsters need work but if you’re a woman who’s lost her state pension without notice and no time to prepare you also need to work.”Pauline Hinder, who is from the west country, said she has not worked for the past few years due to her employer forcing her to retire on health grounds back in 2017.The 64-year-old former civil servant, who is recovering from two types of cancer, said she was now claiming disability benefits due to being too unwell to work – but wishes she had her state pension to rely on instead.She said: “I had cancer in 2013 and then a different one in 2014. I can’t work because of the side effects from the last cancer I’ve had. I sometimes have incontinence issues because I’ve had major surgery.“It is a fact of life that as you get older, you get less well. If you are a class of people who is less rich and less wealthy, all of your social and living conditions are going to be lower and your life expectancy is going to be lower and illness probability is going to be higher. Ageism is also a big problem. This country in the 21st century is discriminatory against women and even more so against older women.“I don’t have children. I don’t have a partner. I am on antidepressants. If you had a decent pension, like Germany or France, then you could have a holiday. Or do the things you dreamed of doing in your retirement, that you didn’t have time to do when you were younger. The government seems to ignore quality of life unless it’s for the wealthy. There is a growing disparity between the wealthy and the poor.”*Miriam Jones’ name has been changed to protect her identity Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Baroness Lawrence, Sir Keir Starmer’s race relations adviser, pointed to new analysis by Labour which suggests that inner city areas with much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations have among the highest rates of furloughed staff. Workers in these areas could be at a higher risk of redundancy later this year, the party warns. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from the House of Commons library shows that nine of the sixteen parliamentary constituencies with the highest take-up rate of the furlough scheme also have much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations.  They include Tottenham, in London, where the figures show half of the population is from a Bame community and 39 per cent of those eligible have been furloughed. Baroness Lawrence said: “This pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in this country, and now there is mounting evidence that they will be hit hardest by the economic impact too. “The government must support black, Asian and ethnic minority communities by introducing a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors. “If we are going to effectively address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 we must eradicate the systemic inequalities that it thrives on.”  In April Sir Keir appointed Baroness Lawrence as his race relations adviser and asked her to lead a review into the effect of the coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour peer, whose son Stephen Lawrence was killed as he waited at a bus stop in 1993, is expected to publish her report later this year.

While none of those named in the report have disputed the veracity of the messages, some have said that claims made in the report are false. The leaked internal communications also show officials warning to keep certain activities, including the direction of some campaigning resources, secret from the leadership and its allies or any other officials they deemed to be too left wing.“Many of us experienced the daily hostility and obstruction towards Jeremy, his office and members of the shadow cabinet and the frequent leaking and hostile briefing to the media,” the statement says, adding that “some of us will provide examples of these in our inidual submissions”. In 2016 hostile MPs tried to replace Mr Corbyn as party leader in a so-called “coup”, but he was re-elected with a bigger majority in a second leadership contest.Keir Starmer commissioned lawyer Martin Forde QC to lead an inquiry into the leaked document after it came to light, to look into its contents and how it was leaked. Other than factional hostility, the dossier claimed a “toxic” culture had developed at the party’s head office that included racist, sexist and violent language. It also claimed that factional hostility made it harder to deal with antisemitism in the party.

A separate submission, reported by , from the officials accused of sabotage, alleges that the leaked report misused their private messages to make them seem racist and sexist. They are expected to take the Labour Party to court over alleged data protection breaches and libel.One of the former staff members involved described the suggestion by Mr Corbyn\u0027s team as a ridiculous conspiracy theory and an attempt to create a stab in the back myth adding: “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence.However, one election night chat log included in the leaked report showed that 45 minutes after the exit poll revealed that Labour had overturned the Conservative majority, one senior official said the result was the “opposite to what I had been working towards for the last couple of years”.

The party said a previous statement about staffers had “contained defamatory and false allegations”.Labour won 40 per cent of the vote in 2017, unexpectedly costing Theresa May her majority in parliament and increasing the party’s vote share from 30 per cent in 2015. In 2019, riven by splits over a possible second referendum and allegations of antisemitism, the party fell to 32 per cent and lost swathes of seats, particularly in the Midlands and north of England. The 2019 result was the worst in terms of MPs elected since 1935, though Labour’s second highest vote share since 2005.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Lebanon’s president has admitted he knew about a massive stockpile of explosive material stored at Beirut’s port nearly three weeks before it blew up, causing one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in modern history.Michel Aoun has however denied he was responsible for the devastating blast, saying on Friday he had no authority over the port and had ordered that action be taken.His comments mark the most senior confirmation yet that Lebanon’s rulers and security officials were aware that 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate had been stored improperly at the port.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe chemicals exploded on Tuesday after apparently being set off by a fire – killing 150 people, wounding more than 5,000, and causing billions of pounds of damage across the city.“Do you know how many problems have been accumulating?” Mr Aoun replied when a reporter pressed whether he should have followed up on his order.Beirut grandmother plays piano amongst wreckage of home‘Miracle’ girl found in rubble of Beirut explosion after 24 hours Devastating Beirut ammonium nitrate explosion recreated in new videoHe added that the previous government had known about the dangerous stockpile since it was confiscated from an impounded Russian-leased ship in 2013.Mr Aoun has been in his role since 2016.“The material had been there for seven years, since 2013. It has been there, and they said it is dangerous and I am not responsible. I don’t know where it was placed. I don’t even know the level of danger,” Mr Aoun told a news conference. He said that when he was told of the stockpile on 20 July he immediately ordered military and security officials “to do what is needed”.“There are ranks that should know their duties, and they were all informed ... When you refer a document and say, ‘do what is needed’, isn’t that an order?”Anger against the government has mounted in Beirut, with citizens from across the country descending on the capital to help with the clean-up and rescue efforts in an apparent absence of state-led efforts.Speaking to The Independent, people who have missing loved ones or were made homeless by the blast blamed chronic corruption and mismanagement within the ruling elite for the devastation, adding that authorities had done nothing to help them.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Former port officials told  newspaper they believed that fireworks had been placed inside warehouse 12, where the ammonium nitrate was stored, despite the obvious dangers.Gemmayze, Beirut’s beating heart, left in ruins by explosionThe same former port worker said that welding work was being carried out in the vicinity of the warehouse that may have started the initial fire.  Meanwhile Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday denied that the Lebanese militant group was involved in any way or excised any control on the port, saying – seemingly in jest – that the group knew Haifa port in Israel better than Beirut Port.He did not rule out a missile attack or an act of sabotage being behind the explosion but said that storing explosive materials like ammonium nitrate at the port for so long means “it is partially an issue of negligence, corruption, nepotism” that should not be ignored.There are concerns that the explosion could lead to a surge in coronavirus cases as at least four hospitals, including one hosting a Covid-19 testing facility, have been destroyed.  The World Health Organisation said it was scrambling to deploy $1.7m worth of personal protective equipment to Beirut after 17 containers filled with supplies for coronavirus response were destroyed at the port.Dr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the eastern Mediterranean, said the “massive extra burden of injured people” could cause the health system to be “overstretched” by the emergency and coronavirus responses.This came as the Ministry of Health registered a daily record of 279 new Covid-19 cases.World leaders have cautiously stepped up to assist embattled Lebanon, although many have expressed concerns about corruption.European Council president Charles Michel is due to head to blast-ravaged Beirut for weekend talks with Lebanon’s leaders as the EU weighs up its contribution to a donor conference in coming days.He will also take part in a French-organised donor conference, along with the EU’s crisis management commissioner. Brussels has said that the virtual meeting would take place on Sunday, but France has yet to confirm a date. Pope Francis, meanwhile, sent a €250,000 donation to the Church of Lebanon to help in the aftermath of the explosion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And while there are many good sources to bulk buy masks for a reasonable price, you can never beat a cost-cutting DIY expedition. Health officials have strongly urged the public not to buy up surgical masks, which are vital for frontline health workers to protect themselves while treating patients.Instead, Brits have been advised to try making their own at home version.Homemade masks wont offer the same protection as medical-grade masks, but experts say they still work to some level.One of the simplest ways to make one at home is to use paper you already have at home - just take two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape, punch two holes in and thread elastic or a hair tie through to fit around your ears.If you want to stfen it so that it is more secure you can add some wire into the ends before taping them up.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the t-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.The Government has also released \" href\"https:www.gov.uk government publications how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"instructions on how to make a face mask from a T-shirt.You dont have to make your own homemade face mask to keep yourself safe. A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.The Government says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly.For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.People with disabilites, breathing dficulties and children are exempt from wearing face masks in stores and on public transport. These people have been asked to download an exemption card from the TfL website so that they can show staff when asked about wearing a face covering.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies that is advising the government said the evidence that masks slow the spread is marginal but positive.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.As soon as you touch the mask having put it on it becomes redundant, some say.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.From August  the compulsory wearing of face masks is being extended in England to many indoor areas.Masks willneed tobe worn in public spaces such as cinemas, museums, hair salons and places of worship.Face masks were made mandatory for people to wear on public transport from June  and people are now required to wear masks in shops, which came into force from July .On July , Matt Hancock confirmed it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine. Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.Passengers on public transport have already been told to wear masks when travelling, with commuters refused travelthey arent wearing oneTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to only wear face coverings - such as a scarf, piece of cloth or mask - and not surgical masks which should be reserved for health staff.Commuters should expect to see signs at stations and transport hubs outlining the new rules.Speaking on May , the UK Governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.Just last week, German authorities examined an underground tunnel as they continue to investigate suspect Christian B as the new prime suspect in Maddies disappearance.The -year-old sex offender had been in Praia de Luz at the time of Maddies disappearance.And he was this year named as German police announced a major breakthrough in the decades old case - claiming they had concrete evidence that Madeleine was dead.As part of the investigation, it is hoped a tiny scrap of blue material held in the vaults of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine. Tests uncovered a microscopic a DNA profile initially identied as semen, but later confirmed to be saliva.Scientists were unable to obtain a full DNA profile at the time but have continued to work on it with new testing techniques.Authorities now hope that continuing advances in DNA testing may yet provide a full profile for comparison with the convicted paedophile and rapist.Portuguese cops had launched an initial search when the little girl vanished in , with the politan Police then taking on the probe to find Maddie in . So far, more than£. million has been spent on the investigation.The case has drawn worldwide attention, with Madeleines own parents even accused over her disappearance as theories over what happened to the three-year-old abounded.But despite the sometimes grim nature of forensic work, Prof Gallop has remained motivated.She said: “People’s freedom, and often their sense of justice is at stake.“Also family feelings andthey have lost a loved one – there is the need to provide proper closureat all possible.“All of these things you are well aware of, and I think it just drives you to do as well as you possibly can.“Stick at it and be as careful, innovative and accurate as you can – that’s what keeps you going.”But she is also quick to point out it hasn’t just been her but a team of scientists who have helped solve these cold cases.It was in  that her team managed to piece together what happened to Rachel Nickell, a -year-old woman who was murdered on Wimbledon Common, in South-West London in .Thanks to Prof Gallop’s team, a tiny trace of DNA that had previously been missed was found, leading to the conviction of Robert Napper  years after Rachel’s death.In another investigation with staggering attention to detail, Prof Gallop and her team found a tiny blood stain on the shorts of John Cooper.The blood belonged to Peter Dixon, who had been killed alongside his Gwenda Dixon in Pembrokeshire in .Cooper was ultimately given a whole le order for the  double murder of siblings Richard and Helen Thomas along with the Dixons in .It is this fastidiousness to detail and objectivity in investigating that Prof Gallop is keen to pass on.Due to cuts around police funding, more forensic investigations are being done in house.Prof Gallop said: “I’m just left wonderingthis is appropriate.By her own admission, she wasn’t that interested in school and struggled towards the end of her university about what she was going to spend her le doing.Then one day a friend showed her an advertisement in the paper to work in forensic science.She said: “I realised I wanted to do something that involved applied science, as opposed to pure research for example, and that was more immediately important for people in general.“One of my friends came over and said have a look at this ad in the newspaper – is that applied enough for you ”Starting her career working for the Home Office Forensic Science Service in , she has since started her own forensic laboratories and even been awarded a CBE in .So what has kept her going through her career of more than four decades Prof Gallop explained: “I find it fascinating, the whole investigative aspect to it. It’s like peeling an onion and seeing what each layer reveals.“I was pretty awful at school until the last few years but they always used to say I was very tenacious.“If something interested me, I would always stick at it until I really understood it.“That’s been handy to have – that attitude of needing to get to the bottom of things.”And while others may use CSI-type shows and podcasts to relax, Prof Gallop mostly stays away from the recent trend of true crime.She said: “Personally, I can’t watch much of it. Butit provides entertainment for others, that’s fine.“People need to be entertained but I will inevitably get irritated by the inaccuracies and the way things are portrayed. As ever, I think real le is much more interesting.”However, she does admit to having a soft spot for Inspector Morse - as he works around her birthplace of Oxford – and a touch of Agatha Christie.She has written a book herself – When the Dogs Don’t Bark: A Forensic Scientist’s Search for the Truth.In it, Prof Gallop examines the lessons she has learnt over more than  years in science.She added: “We all know these days about cognitive bias where,you are expecting something, you may be more likely to think you’ve found it.“Andyour budget is restricted, and you’ve only been able to do a few tests on one or two items, you’ll only get half the picture and you could draw wholly inappropriate conclusions and end up misleading people.”She added: “I’m also worried that all the lessons we’ve so painstakingly learned about how to solve dficult cases will be lost. It’s all about combining novel approaches to find evidence with new technology to analyse it – not usually one or the other on their own.”And she pointed out how effective forensic science could be when it was used properly.She said: “It has been demonstrated time and time again, that it is so much cheaper to spend slightly more money on forensic science up front than having endless re-investigations and public inquiries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety.

Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary. It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity. But they are both great ideas. There is a place in everyone’s le for regular exercise and regular peri-peri chicken.So it is odd that every picture of Summer Monteys-Fullam – hanging out with her horse, posing with her glamorous mum, running with her dog Cookie – is accompanied by the demeaning appendage “Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood’s ex-girlfriend.” To some of us, Summer means more than Paul.Or as we like to think of him: “Paul Hollywood, , the ex-boyfriend of Summer Monteys-Fullam.”AFTER repeatedly punching his greyhound in the face, Joseph Pocklington, , has been banned from keeping pets for two years.If a dog was guilty of such a brutal assault, it would be put down.

Reopening schools is essential.If we do not feel test and trace is fully in place by September, we need to look carefully at the level of R [rating the virus’s ability to spread] at that point and look at what trade-offs may be necessary.“That is when I would be very clear that schools need to be open before pubs and clubs.”He added: “I think many Britons would find it very dficult to think pubs were open when schools were shut.“It is about what is necessary for the future of society and what is not. Schools are necessary and I am afraid that pubs are not.”The study comes after fears grew schools might only open their doors until lunchtime when pupils are due back in the classroom in September.Some schools will be doing this twice a week and some may close at an earlier time on all five days.Hardline teaching unions had threatened many schools wont re-open at all in September amid fears over coronavirus safety measures.Head teachers claim schools need to close early so staff can carry out the extra safety measures caused by the pandemic, including more time for deep cleaning.One teacher has died from the virus in the UK - and they didnt pick it up from school, according to papers from the Government advisory group Sage.The average number of confirmed Covid- cases among children is close to zero and its believed no child has needed hospital treatment since the beginning of June.Three teachers needed hospital care over the same period.Several schools will reportedly send their children home early at least one afternoon a week so teachers can plan lessons and mark work.Teachers would do their marking while a teaching assistant would take over the class, but schools say this is dficult as teachers and students remain in a bubble.Nine out of ten parents back the full reopening of schools next month.The Office for National Statistics found  per cent of parents were likely or fairly likely to send their kid back to class.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Police patrol crime hotspots in vans and swoop on suspicious behaviour.They are the modern answer to bobbies on the beat — providing a visible rapid reaction force to reassure the public and take crooks off the street.The Sun on Sunday joined the unit to see first-hand the dficulties the young men and women face as they patrol some of the toughest estates.Team leader Inspector Niall O’Neill,  — who worked throughout the  riots sparked by the shooting of Mark Duggan — said: “It’s more hostile than I have ever known it out there — but we can’t let that stop us.“It’s a tinderbox in London and we could be one bad situation away from it erupting.“We’re around the anni­versary of Mark Duggan’s death which has made things more tense.”He defended the tactics as crucial to tackling kne crime in the capital.He added: “We have high stop-and-search figures but it’s a vital tool and it’s a deterrent.“Ten years ago, people would never have taken out zombie and Rambo knives we find now because they knew they’d be searched — and we have to get back to that.”Insp O’Neill, of the Met’s North Command, said a lot of gang members they deal with are  or even younger.On a boiling hot afternoon in Wood Green, North London, snapper Paul Edwards and I joined a VSU team for a sht.The cops cover an area that is home to six gangs among the  most violent in London, including the Northumberland Park Killers .After clambering into a van with four PCs — one armed with a Taser — and a sergeant, we cruised estates, stations and parks known to be hubs of gang activity, muggings and drug dealing.Our first task was a weapons sweep of a common in Haringey. Young cops combed undergrowth, trees and grassland for knives and bats — which are often hidden by gang members so they can grab themviolence flares.The team found machetes and knives stabbed down into grass on previous sweeps, but the park was clean this time.The youngest member of our patrol, police probationer Yaseen Ishak, , told us that last month they seized a loaded handgun, ammunition and  bags of cannabis after investigating a suspicious car.Next stop was Northumberland Grove, an estate in the shadow of Tottenham Hotspur’s new £billion stadium — and in the heart of NPK territory.The unit — who recently found a zombie kne in the area — was responding to reports of crack smoking and drugs being stashed on walkways of the low-rise blocks.As our van pulled up, two PCs looked up to the second floor. Gangs use “spotters” who peer over balconies looking for rivals and cops, they explained.Sure enough, two tracksuit-clad youths were there and smirked at officers, who looked for drug users and gang members on the walkways.A bit later as we turned a corner, a cop spotted a discarded gym bag on the pavement. The team checked it for drugs or weapons.They were abused by a gang of youths nearby who claimed the bag belonged to them.Our team — one of whom was Asian, another mixed race — were met with hostility and accusations of racism.In their first six weeks, the North Command’s VSU officers made  arrests for  offences — with  per cent of them coming from stop– and-search.They picked up  wanted offenders and seized  knives, four baseball bats, two golf clubs and the loaded firearm.And as lockdown has eased, they are once again in the front line in the war against violent crime and drugs.As Met chief Cressida Dick says opposite, “county lines” gangs now stretch from Aberdeen to Cornwall.Officers daily put their lives on the line dealing with drug-fuelled violence.Policing today can often seem like an impossible task.But officers’ traditional values of bravery and dedication remain as strong as ever.Front-line units in the Met — and across the country — are also leading the fight against “county lines” gangs trafficking drugs from big cities to every corner of the UK.Inspector O’Neill added: “High-visibility policing is essential and we have to get out there and target hotspots.”POLICING is the best job in the world. You get to save lives, protect the public and help at the worst times in people’s lives.Today’s officers deal with terrorism, international gangsters and online sex crimes, as well as the same old burglars, violent street criminals and drug dealers wrecking lives and scaring people.Now, Covid. As the virus stole loved ones, putting such pressure on our NHS and our whole country, people stayed off the streets for their own safety, while thousands of officers stayed on them.Still patrolling  , the police ensured neighbourhoods stayed safe. Officers worked long hours explaining the regulations, encouraging people to do the right thing. The vast majority responded with patience, kindness and humour.At the same time, we kept up arrests – of gang members and domestic abusers, scammers and robbers – seizing knives, guns, drugs and cash at record levels.Officers ran into danger as others ran away, responding to calls from the public and tackling violent criminals.I’ve been with my frontline officers during the pandemic and I am so proud of their courage, patience and tenacity.In the past few weeks, two of my officers on routine patrols have been stabbed as they answered calls from the public.Others have been beaten with a bat and a bottle, punched, spat and coughed at and had vehicles driven at them. Bricks and missiles have been hurled as they have sought to break up anti-social “music events” – large, often violent, illegal gatherings hated by local people.The protests in the wake of the appalling death of George Floyd were mostly peaceful but degenerated into violence in which dozens of officers were assaulted and buildings damaged.Officers know each day will be dferent and that they may face danger.They are better trained, more professional, better equipped than ever.But vicious assaults are never acceptable. We have already arrested more than  people since June for these offences, many have already received hefty prison sentences.We rely on the support of the public – and I know the vast majority of people do trust, support and help us.Every day, I hear tales of courage by a member of the public giving us sensitive information to save a le or detaining a fleeing armed robber. Since lockdown started, most crimes have reduced considerably – a welcome break. As people have ed to the streets, the criminals have become more active again.Tackling violence remains our number-one priority here in London. That’s what the public are most concerned about.Together, in the past two years, we have reduced the numbers of young people being stabbed, robberies using mopeds and acid attacks.Almost every day, we are closing a “county line” running from London to as far away as Aberdeen, Wales or Cornwall, locking up the “kingpin”, stopping children being used to deliver drugs.In the past few days we have arrested murderers, organised criminals and gang members. We have seized guns, bullets, flick knives and hunting knives.Sometimes we have to use force and sometimes we use powers such as stop-and-search. We do it to keep people safe, to save lives. It works.Just this week, a stop resulted in a car key being found. The car was nearby. It had been stolen and used in a robbery. There was a handgun in the door. Sadly, violent crime affects some communities much more than others. So we are patrolling and enforcing the law in some places more than others.Most citizens want more policing, not less, and support stop-and-search.All of our use of force and powers are highly scrutinised. Our officers carry body-worn video. They have to account for their actions.We invite members of the community to examine our work.I want everyone to have trust in the police, to know they are protected by the best police services in the world.That is why we have invested in local neighbourhood officers, officers in schools, our fantastic cadets, more volunteers and special constables.We are not perfect but we learn and improve constantly. And right now, we are recruiting and growing. Today, I have over , more officers in the Met than just a couple of years ago.So thank you to the police officers and staff up and down the country who have been so adaptable, brave and busy during the past few months.At a tough and worrying time for the country, police presence has been reliable and reassuring. Thank YOU for following the rules about lockdown.And thank you to everyone who works with us to prevent or solve crime.

Bracht has said the reports that she had joined ISIS in Syria are untrue.She admits she had been involved with controversial campaign group Cage - which once described Jihadi John as a beautul young man.Two years ago it was alleged Bracht travelled to Syria in  where she married ISIS fighter Celso Rodrigues Da Costa - a -year-old from London.It was also claimed she was among a group of Western women held in Kurdish-controlled camps in northern Syria. Bracht told The Sunday People: “It has affected my family. I’ve been treated like a  terror suspect.It’s not for me. I can live with this. I have accepted I am a full-time terror suspect without conviction.She was born at a British Army camp in Bielefeld, Germany, and was living in Heidelberg when the pandemic hit.

I mean, who could guess the public would be less likely to follow the rules when the person giving them out takes no notice of them and says he had to drive to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight  This is why the best driving instructors tell learners how important it is to look in the mirror before indicating, then setting off slowly in first gear. They should say, “But first, watch this”, and spin the tyres before reversing at full speed through the window of the Co-op, asking the learner to lean out and grab some crisps as he drives down the middle aisle. Thenthey’re caught by the police they can say, “I’ve got earache” and carry on. If Dominic Cummings was a captain in a plane, he’d announce at the start of the flight: “We ask that you remain in your seats at all times when the seatbelt sign is showing.” As soon as turbulence started he’d put a trampoline on the floor, shout “look at me everyone”, and bounce on it while smoking a cigar and juggling grenades. One in three people who had broken the rules gave the Dominic Cummings story as their reason. The survey found “people were actually using the word ‘Cummings’ in encounters with the police to justy ­antisocial behaviour”.  This is a tremendous achievement. Usually most people don’t know the name of the Prime Minister’s adviser but he has changed all that. Now there are people who use his name to justy doing a wee in a public fountain or poisoning their neighbour’s fish. In some countries, this might result in the person caught cheating having to resign.  Similarly,a health and safety officer gave a lecture to office staff about the importance of tucking away loose cables that might be tripped over, and then fired a bazooka at the accounts department, incinerating the fourth floor, they might be given a written warning at least. But he’s got away with it. Now several witnesses claim they saw him on another day in the woods in Durham. If these claims are true, I’m sure there’s a simple explanation. Maybe his eyesight got a lot worse that day and he thought he was popping into the kitchen.

And the PM must act NOW to prevent it, a former government chief scientic adviser warns today. Sir David King said: “We need a proper test and trace system by September. Otherwise full school opening will put us right back.” Sir David says we are “nowhere near” the safe reopening of schools. He is urging Boris Johnson to “get it right” in August – or face a second wave of coronavirus infections. And he blasted the Government’s track and trace policy as “disastrous”. Sir David, , heads the Independent Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies shadowing the Prime Minister’s scientic team. He said: “The Government has a month to deal with the level of infectivity as it stands now. Reopening schools should be a priority, but we believe we are nowhere near the point where it can be done safely.” He said the R rate of infection number is expected to rise by about . with all schools open. On Friday, government figures showed the national rate as between . and  – the tipping point – as infections rise again. “We need a proper test and trace system by September,” said Sir David. “Otherwise I’m sure school opening will put us right back. We will see the Government backing lockdowns and, yes, I do think this could happen nationally.”  Sir David – who set up Independent SAGE amid concerns about political interference on the official advisory committee – said: “Test and trace is still failing dramatically. Tracing here is one phone call and you are asked to isolate. There is no follow-up as to whether people do.” He urged the PM to take track and trace from private firm Serco and let councils run it. “The Government made a disastrous mistake giving contact tracing to a firm with no healthcare expertise,” he said. “The Serco contract is up for renewal this month. They’ve had roughly £million so far. They’ll get £ millionit’s extended. This is not working. When you hit , new cases a day, it’s an enormous number for any national body to deal with. But break it down into local regions and the numbers become manageable.” Sir David said the Government should follow other countries and put isolating members of multi-generational households in hotels to avoid infecting relatives.

They are expected to show our economy shrank by a staggering  per cent in the April to June in lockdown. The three-month fall will be the year’s second consecutive quarterly period of negative growth – which is technically a full-blown recession. The revelation comes during a tidal wave of job losses led by high street store closures amid warnings that four million could be on the dole by the end of the year.  The alarming figures will also increase pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend his job retention scheme beyond October.The respected Resolution Foundation think tank – which aims to improve standards of living for low and middle income families – says the scale of the nosee will be like nothing in living memory. Director James Smith said: “The figures will demonstrate the speed and depth of the economic hit. The outlook is incredibly bleak.” The Foundation wants the taxpayer-funded furlough scheme, which has protected more than nine million jobs, to be continued for hardest hit sectors. Mr Smith added: “Mr Sunak is gambling with people’s jobs and livelihoodshe doesn’t act decisively.” His call was backed by the TUC, which wants the Government to jump-start the economy now by investing in “green infrastructure” schemes, such as homes and ­transport, which it says would create more than a million jobs in two years.  It also points out there are hundreds of thousands of vacancies that urgently need filling in health and social care. General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The more people we have in work, the faster we can work our way out of recession. “Protecting jobs is vital, but so is creating jobs. If mass unemployment is allowed to take hold it’ll be a much longer recession.” "},{"url":null,"title":"maltesers actress samantha renke weird","story":"NewsTeachers brutally honest advice devastated disabled star of Maltesers TV advertActress Samantha Renke, who is probably best known as the star of a hilarious Maltesers advert, talks about her efforts to change attitudes toward disabilitiesShareByEmma Jones:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video disability-campaigner-claims-refused-electric-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news real-le-stories maltesers-actress-samantha-renke-weird-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The first words my parents heard when I was born were, ‘We’re sorry, there’s something wrong with your child.’ If the doctors had said, ‘Your child has osteogenesis imperfecta, but there’s treatment and many people live with it,’ that would have been more accurate. As a child I knew I was ‘dferent’. I have an older sibling who is non-disabled, so I knew I couldn’t walk. I can’t walk because my bones can’t handle the strain. I had multiple fractures from birth and have broken over  bones to this day. But despite my parents being told the prognosis wasn’t good and to just pray for me, they did a wonderful job and always treated me the same as my sister, encouraging me to do whatever I wanted in le. I actually think some of the skills I’ve learned from being a disabled woman are invaluable and have made me who I am today. I quite liked my dferences when I was very young, because people used to come up to me and say, ‘Oh bless her’, and, ‘What a shame’. I now view them as condescending, but as a youngster that came with free toys and sweets and attention. I loved it! I’ve always been an extrovert. Obviously as I got older I realised it wasn’t always positive attention, especially after my father passed away suddenly in . I was nine and because we had to move, I had to change schools, which also meant being separated from my sister, as her new school hadn’t been adapted for people with impairments. I didn’t know anyone at school and for the first time I felt like a real outsider.  I struggled when kids referred to me as ‘the one in the wheelchair’, because prior to that I was just Samantha. I always had this innate sense of being fabulous, to be honest! aposAnd yes I was bullied, but so were other kids. Plus losing a parent affected me and that isn’t related at all to my disability. Everyone thinks disabled people just wish to be cured. But I always enjoyed being me. I liked being dferent and I only ever got upset when other people didn’t accept me and I didn’t understand why. That view changed briefly when the teen angst kicked in, because so many people had told me disability was a bad word. I went through a phase of not wanting anything to do with disabled people… I even hated it when I had to go to hospital and sit in a room with other people who had my condition.  People had told me disability was ugly, disability can’t get a boyfriend, that you have to sit all the ‘normal’ things out. There’s a lot of peer pressure on teenage boys anyway, and I think a lot of them didn’t want to have a girlfriend in a wheelchair. I couldn’t bear to look at my own body, but what I realise now is, like any teenager, I only became self-conscious about what people commented on – like girls who didn’t want to wear glasses, or wished their nose was smaller. I’ve got scars on my legs from ious operations from bone breakingand I’ve never been bothered about them. They’re visible, but I think it’s because people have never made a comment about them.  The turning point for me was a love of fashion. I remember being out with my mum and sister and everyone was staring at me. They stare because they’re curious about wheelchair use, but it’s ignorant. It became too overbearing this day and I was crying. My sister, bless her, said, ‘Maybe people stare at you because you dress really well and you’ve got nice make-up.’ And that was a change in perspective that’s really helped me. Being eccentric, I was mad about acting. I did a professional acting club after school, and one week a scout was coming from London to look for talent for a West End stage show of Oliver. My teacher took me to one side and said people like me won’t get a look in.  Even though that sounds harsh, she was right. That was  years ago, but even now we still only see .% of on-screen talent who are disabled. That devastated me at the time and I went on to become a teacher until a chance meeting at a house party with a director landed me a role in a little indie film. From that, I got an agent, then landed the Maltesers ad. It sees me telling the story of how I ran off with the best man at a wedding and not only was it shown abroad, it’s one of YouTube’s most searched adverts. I think it was powerful and it made me more approachable. People started coming up to me for selfies and a chat, which was great because people can be awkward around disability. That was so refreshing and liberating.  It hasn’t made me a big celebrity by any means, but it does mean I don’t use dating apps like Tinder. Some people recognise me and just want to have a laugh. But I find internet dating intimidating anyway. Do I disclose my disability or not  Because a lot of people have this unconscious bias. And there is definitely a weird fascination with disability and sex –I were to put a picture of my wheelchair, people would assume I can’t have sex or won’t make good dating material. I know people are curious, but my advice would be,you would never ask a stranger a certain question why would you ask someone with a disability that question   Now I live in a great flat in London that’s adapted and I can do whatever I like. I’m only disabled because my environment disables me, but in my apartment I’m self-sufficient. It’s as soon as I leave that home I become disabled and then my le is problematic. As well as the acting , I do a lot of charity work. I talk in parliament, and as well as lobbying for more accessible housing , one of my main campaigns is to change the fact many disabled women can’t access smear tests, which is criminal. They rarely have hoists, so I have to take a friend with me. It just goes to show again that we’re infantilised – people assume we’re not having sex and therefore don’t need a smear. A lot of disabled women are going without. Even mammograms.

Pamela Zeinoun was working on the ­maternity ward at the city’s Saint George Hospital on Tuesday when the explosion rocked the city, killing at least , wounding more than , and leaving more than , homeless. She was knocked unconscious and came round to find other doctors and nurses injured, ceilings collapsed, rooms strewn with rubble and equipment smashed on the floor. Then she spotted her tiny patients – a twin brother and sister and another baby – who were still alive in their blood-spattered incubators. “I had to pull the babies from the ­windows of the incubators, not from the doors,” said Pamela. “I had to squeeze them so they could fit all three between my arms.” Pamela told how she then ran down four flights of darkened blood-soaked stairs, clutching the babies tightly to her chest. She said: “I was afraid that one of them would slip so I was always patting my chest to check all three heads were still with me. “All emergency exits were blocked, so we had to dig our way out. We reached the ground… the scene was horrible. Doctors and nurses were on the floor and patients were ­running in fright. We couldn’t do anything. “I saw many colleagues who were bleeding from injuries on their hands, heads and backs. “Doctors were stitching patients’ wounds. There were no medical materials to work with. “We were very scared and could not understand what had really happened until then.”  Despite the chaos, Pamela was pictured calmly answering the emergency room phone while clutching the three babies – a moment that has become a touching symbol of hope. The hospital – around half a mile from the port – was badly hit. Four of the nursing staff lost their lives, alongside  patients and a visitor. More than  doctors, nurses, patients and admin staff suffered injuries. The blast smashed buildings  miles away and threw cars into the air – but Pamela walked the babies through the wreckage to another hospital more than three miles away. She said: “Bystanders volunteered to help, to give us their shirts to keep the babies safe. “The three newborns are under kg each and I had to cover them up and keep them warm otherwise they wouldn’t live.” The brave nurse says she was driven by fear of losing the babies.“I would not have been able to stand the situation had I lost any of them,” she said. Photo-journalist Bilal Jawich, who took the now iconic photo of Pamela holding the babies, said: “I noticed the nurse’s calm, which ­contrasted with the surrounding atmosphere. She looked like she possessed a hidden force.

Beaches have been packed throughout the weekend as temperatures reached  degrees yesterday in some parts of the country. Some local councils pleaded with tourists to stay away due to fears of overcrowding, with most of Bournemouth beach being put on red alert. Locals shared their dismay at the state of Brighton beach this morning, with the seafront covered in carrier bags and bottles.Dr Chloe Peacock shared an image on Twitter of litter covering the beach. She said: “The on-the-spot fines working well then !Went for a swim at am today as this is the only time I feel it’s safe for locals before the hoards descend.” Samantha Hornsby also shared a video of rubbish covering the beach. She posted: “Brighton beach is an absolute state yet again this morning. Walked here as I do every morning to go for a swim and don’t even wanna get in the sea.” She added: Just walked past some survivors from last night - a couple pretty much having sex next to a group casually taking coke while people stroll past. This is a lot for a am walk Iaposm not gonna lie.  Beachgoers have been warned they will be fined £ on-the-spotthey are caught dropping litter. The council has issued nearly  fines for environmental crimes in the last three months – bringing in £, for the council. The city said it saw its highest ever amount of rubbish collected on a single day on June , prompting a big campaign to keep the beach tidy.  Meanwhile in the streets of Cleethorpes, Grimsby, overflowing bins have been pictured with mountains of litter lining the streets, reports the Grimsby . Among the rubbish were bags containing empty crisp packets, drinks cans and bottles, fish and chip wrappings, unwanted ice cream cones, coffee cups, takeaway trays, McDonaldaposs packaging, and even a pair of flipflops. Councillor Ron Shepherd said: We wonapost tolerate littering on our streets and enforcement officers will give fixed penalty tickets for littering and dog control offences.  There are more than  litter bins in the area, including  along Central Promenade in Cleethorpes so there is no excuse to drop litter. Littering makes the place look a mess, itaposs harmful to wildle and the environment. If a bin is full, take your rubbish home.  Discarded PPE is also a threat to the environment and to wildle. Environmentalist Emily Stevenson, also known as the Beach, has said that PPE has become a major threat to the environment and ocean.

Brits have been enjoying the roasting heat this weekend with temperatures reaching  degrees yesterday. Battersea Cats and Dogs Home told people not to leave dogs in their cars “under any circumstances” due to the risk of overheating. The charity advised: Leaving them alone in a car when it is warm for even a few minutes can be fatal - eventhe car is parked in the shade, or a window has been left open. The animal shelter said breeds that were ‘flat faced’ like pug sand French bulldogs were more at risk in this weather. This advice was echoed by the RSPCA that said pets can suffer heatstroke or heat exhaustion which can be fatal. An RSPCA spokesman said: Animals donapost always realise when theyaposre too hot so itaposs important that we keep a close eye on them. Ensure they have constant access to cool or shady areas and fresh water, avoid exercising them during the hottest parts of the day, and never, ever leave them alone in a hot car, caravan, conservatory or outbuilding. The warning comes after four kittens were dumped at the side of the road to die in scorching heat on Friday. The RSPCA said it was appalled after it picked them up from Romford. Animal Welfare Officer Siobhan Trinnaman said: “Iaposm appalled that these kittens have been deliberately abandoned especially as it was  degrees where I picked them up. We are just grateful that they were found when they were and that the caller waited with them. The kittens could have easily died in this box in this heat,the poor things. The poor little mites, they were so thin their spines were prominent and theyaposre full of flu and all had sticky gunky eyes, so I took them straight to the RSPCA Harmsworth Memorial Animal Hospital where they will be kept in isolation while theyaposre treated.

The -year-old factory worker from Manchester joined the Army in  to do his bit like millions of others. On his way to the Far East, his ship was torpedoed and he was captured by the Japanese. Over the next two years he was starved and beaten in a squalid prisoner of war camp. And in  he was herded on to a “hell ship” with  other PoWs to go to another camp. The unmarked cargo vessel was torpedoed by a US submarine and only half of the captives, including Jack, managed to escape. For around eight hours they ­floated in the Pacic while the Japanese picked up their own men. Then they turned machine guns on the helpless prisoners, spending hours finishing them all off. After the war the atrocity was ­investigated but no war crimes charges were ever brought against those ­responsible. Even Jack’s elder brother George – who fought the Japanese in Burma – went to his grave in  unaware of what had happened. But the story can be revealed for the first time today thanks to a new book by George’s granddaughter. Jacquelyn Frith – named after her great uncle – spent ten years ­unearthing facts that were shelved for nearly  years. She also hopes to raise awareness of the sacrice of the thousands of Brits who died fighting Japan. They are dubbed the Forgotten Army because the campaign is not as well known as the battle against Japan’s ally Hitler.  Jacquelyn spoke to the Sunday People as Britain prepares to honour the th anniversary next Saturday of VJ Day when the announcement of Japan’s surrender marked the end of the Second World War. She said: “Last year on VJ Day I went to Southport War Memorial and I was the only person standing there. I laid the only wreath on the monument. “I think that was absolutely tragic that they had all been forgotten. It’s emotional just thinking about it. “Those who fought in Europe, in North Africa, in the Far East, were all brothers in arms, no matter where they were.” In  her uncle Jack left his job doing essential war work in a factory in Hyde to join up – hoping to avenge the death of a friend in the battle of Crete. Jack, a gunner in the th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery, was on a ­convoy heading for North Africa when Japan joined the war on Germany’s side by bombing the US navy base Pearl Harbor. His ship was ­ordered to the Far East instead but it was sunk. Just three weeks after he had set off and ­without ever firing a shot, he was forced to build an airstrip with other Brits in Java.  Jacquelyn, , said: “The PoWs tried to sabotage the work but were killedthey were caught. “One day one chap, a ­trooper with the King’s Own Hussars, simply spilled water on ­himself and jumped up. “The Japanese started hitting him with their rles. He put up his arms to ­defend himself but they thought he was trying to grab one of their weapons. “They took him into the forest and dispatched him. He is one of many Far East prisoners of war with no resting place.” On November , ,  PoWs including Jack were packed into the Japanese freighter Suez Maru sailing from Ambon for Surabaya. Prisoners were crammed into cargo holds with little air, food or water for ­journeys that could last weeks.  Many died of starvation, dysentery or beatings and their bodies were thrown overboard. The Geneva Convention of  set out that prisoner or hospital ships should be marked clearly with red crosses.But Japan ignored the conventions and , Allied prisoners died because ­transport ships were sunk by accident. On November  the submarine USS Bonefish torpedoed the Suez Maru ­unaware it was carrying PoWs. Most ­prisoners drowned in the holds but an estimated , including -year-old Jack, were shot in the water. Official papers about the massacre were not declassied until . Jacquelyn, from Southport, Merseyside, said: “Jack survived almost two years in a prisoner of war camp in relentless ­inhumanity.He then survived a ship being sunk in a torpedo attack, only to be shot as he struggled in the sea. “The case came to light in . The Australians built up a very strong open and shut case, recording  statements from eye-witnesses, with each of the accounts very similar.We know from interrogation records exactly what happened.

Natalie Bracht denies she once led an all female Islamic State unit in Syria and says she is resigned to being forever treated as a terror suspect “without conviction”.Bracht, , who has claimed Universal Credit, says she hopes to make a living as a busker.She had been staying in Germany, where she holds dual nationality by birth but after Covid- took hold she was repatriated and put up in a £-a-night Travelodge. She has now moved on to a barge. The revelation comes just weeks after the controversy over a legal ­battle by IS teen Shamima Begum to regain her British citizenship after fleeing to the Middle East in . This week Bracht told The Sunday People that reports two years ago which said she had joined Islamic State in Syria were untrue.But she admitted she had been involved with the controversial ­campaign group Cage – which once described Brit IS executioner Jihadi John as a “beautul young man”.Two years ago it was said Bracht had travelled in  to Syria, where she married Celso Rodrigues Da Costa, , an IS fighter from London.It was also claimed she was among a group of Western women held in Kurdish-controlled camps in northern Syria. Bracht said: “It has affected my family. I’ve been treated like a  terror suspect.” She added: “It looks like I have to have a new identity and the stories must be put straight. “It’s not for me. I can live with this. I have accepted I am a full-time terror suspect without conviction. “It either breaks you or makes you stronger. In my case it has made me stronger.” Born in Bielefeld, Germany, on a British Army camp, Natalie was living in Heidelberg when Covid hit. After visiting the British consulate in Dusseldorf she was given a ticket to board a British Airways flight from Frankfurt to London on April . But when she landed she says she was stopped and “interrogated” by Special Branch for more than three hours under Schedule  of the Terrorism Act .Bracht continued: “They were asking me about what I thought about Brexit, how I think about elections, what I think about vaccines. “They asked me where I had stayed in Syria. I had to tell them a couple of times, ‘Guys, I wasn’t in Syria.’” She claims she is being supported by the Helping Households Under Great Stress organisation – set up to help “Muslim households impacted by counter-terrorism, national security and extremism-related laws, policies and procedures”. And she said that in around  she began volunteering as an interpreter for Cage. She said she began translating letters for ­terror suspects held in prisons across the world because she had concerns about rising Islamophobia and a “modern-day witch hunt”. And she said she was given access to documents relating to Anwar ­al-Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent. Before he was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen on  September , he was linked to a series of attacks and plots across the world, including the   atrocity in the US.  Natalie said: “It’s a modern witch hunt. These are the oppressed people. “They are in prison, then they are free again and then they are not ­convicted but treated for the rest of their lives as full-time terror suspects. They never had ­convictions.” She also said she sympathised with terror bride Begum. Natalie said: “This girl was brainwashed on the ­internet, the intelligence services didn’t prevent her from leaving the country. “She was only  years old – this should be dealt with by child protection.”  Natalie also said she had met Pierre Vogel, a -year-old who converted to Islam in  who is considered one of Germany’s most prominent Islamist preachers. Natalie first hit the headlines in , when she ran away from home in Sunderland with her then five daughters, fearing they were about to be taken into care. Authorities released an appeal ­stating that Natalie had a personality disorder and saying the police had “serious ­concerns regarding the children’s welfare”.

To fill the time, many people have taken up new hobbies and some families have said their new shared interests have brought them closer together - and they plan to continue them going forward. As the governmentaposs restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey with Very has looked back at how we all spent the strictest months of lockdown and how people view the “new normal”.Both kids and their parents have the opportunity to do new things, with  per cent of mums and dads with teenage kids saying theyaposve tried something for the first time or more often than normal. Cooking and baking is the most popular aposnewapos activity, with  per cent of parents with teenagers and  per cent of people with younger kids surveyed listing it. Gardening and exercise were next up on the list in both groups. Meanwhile, their kids have also enjoyed cooking and baking, at  per cent, while  per cent have tried their hand at gardening. Arts and crafts and growing their own fruit and veg also made the top five.Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that gardening was far lower down the list for kids younger than , with exercise in second place after cooking and baking.Boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. And for many, the group activities have brought them together as a family. Describing the positives of lockdown, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work. Building a veg garden and growing our own veg has been a fun thing for all of us.  And I feel we have all grown closer as a family. Meanwhile, other families used the opportunity to exercise and to improve their fitness. Some even opted to do this all together, either through group work outs or by making it a competition. One parent said: Getting myself fitter by running more on my treadmill. The rest of family doing it as well, so we are fitter as a family physically and mentally. Some made the most of their one trip out of the house for exercise by going out for a walk with loved ones. One wrote: Going for a walk with my daughter and spotting all the wildle and breathing cleaner air. Another added: Going out for walks and discovering areas around where I live that I never knew were there. While everyone has obviously faced their own challenges in lockdown, some people have found itaposs also brought some advantages, Veryaposs research found. Parents of younger kids are more likely to have found the lockdown fun compared to those with teenage children, but an incredible amount say the restrictions have brought them closer as a family.

At the time of the couple’s wedding it was speculated that the new bride would give her own speech but now Finding Freedom has confirmed she did indeed give her own toast. Meghan and Prince Harry tied the knot at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, in May .Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durandaposs biography Finding Freedom says the Duchess recounted ious experiences of her past le in the speech. The book is also set to “reveal unknown details” about Harry and Meghan and will also be dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple in Britain and North America. According to US Weekly the book doesn’t go into detail about what she said but it is claimed she referenced her former marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson. It is claimed the Duchess said finding love was “worth the wait” and she then went onto brand Harry as “the one”.At the time it was reported Meghan also thanked the Royal Family for “welcoming her in”.It is also reported that Prince Harry’s speech ‘had the room in tears’.Speaking to the Sunday Times, one of the coupleaposs friends said Harry told Meghan: I canapost wait to spend the rest of my le with you and said we make such a good team.He also paid tribute to how Meghan has dealt with the extremely dficult week leading up to her wedding, which saw her dad drop out of the wedding to undergo heart surgery.  Prince Charles also gave a speech and spoke about raising Harry and made jokes about changing his nappy. Typically, English royal weddings include a speech from the best man, the host and occasionally the groom, but rarely the bride. However as it turns out Meghan is not the first Royal bride to give a speech at her wedding as the Queen also shared a few words when she wed Prince Philip on November , . Princess Elizabeth thanked her father and mother and her guests before saying how pleased she was to have her grandmother Queen Mary at the wedding table.  She then said: I ask nothing more than that Philip and I should be as happy as my father and mother have been,and Queen Mary and King George before them. Harry and Meghan are now based in Los Angeles, Calornia, after stepping back as senior royals earlier this year.

Estimates put their cost to society at around £billion. Yet the tactics and markets used by them all – from petty crooks to kingpins – were established by a generation of “Mr Bigs” who got things rolling. Now the British “narcos” are named in a book that charts, for the first time, the rise of the modern drug trade. It also details the cat-and-mouse games played between the smugglers and the Customs ­officials, who each found ingenious ways to outwit each other. Drug War describes how the sale of illegal narcotics and ­­stimulants first boomed. In  there were , deaths related to drug poisoning in England and Wales – the highest ever, and also the highest known year-on-year rise, at %. Cocaine seizures in Europe are at a record high, with more than a million drug busts annually. Here we look at the criminals who blazed a trail that still blights us.Drug War: The Secret History by Peter Walsh is out now in paperback from Milo Books.Gurdev Singh Sangha - First modern drug baron  Gurdev Singh Sangha was a brilliant laser scientist – and the first modern drug baron.Arriving in London from India in his teens, he got an honours degree, a masters and a PhDin the s while secretly importing bulk quantities of cannabis resin known as charas.He was first brought to justice by customs officer Sam Charles. Using skills honed chasing watch smugglers, Sam became the most influential man in Britain’s drug war. He started one of the first “data mining” operations, scouring air freight and cargo records for information that did not stack up. That led him to kg of resin hidden in a cargo of mango pickles. A scrawl on a cigarette packet took them to Gurdev Singh Sangha, who was jailed for five years – but started up again on his release. His arrest helped unveil an East Asian network that fed cities around the UK. Bobby and Ronnie - London and Scotland  Bobby Mills and Ron Taylor, a south London villain and a former Scottish miner, formed an unlikely partnership that revolutionised the drugs trade in the s. After meeting in the army during National Service, they turned to crime and both served jail terms before discovering the cannabis boom. The first major traffickers to be regarded as hardcore criminals rather than hippies or chancers, they sailed tonnes of hashish from Morocco on their own ship, the Guiding Lights, until they were caught in a joint police-Customs operation. They were both were arrested again a decade later, unable to resist the lure of easy money. Brian Wright- The Milkman  Brian Wright, now , was the thinking man’s smuggler, a sharply-dressed, well-groomed London-Irishman who masterminded the importation of tonnes of coke in the drug-fuelled nineties and laundering his cash through the sport of horse racing, placing massive wagers while bribing jockeys and stable hands to ‘nobble’ some of the runners. He was known as ‘the Milkman’ because he always delivered. ‘Of all the people I have worked on, he was the most impressive,’ says a senior Customs investigator. ‘He never talked business on the phone. I never heard him shout at anyone. His philosophy was, do everything discreetly, face to face, don’t get involved in violence.’ His empire is said to be worth around £m and he was forced to cough up £.m of his ill-gotten gains. After one of the longest drug investigations ever launched, Operation Extend, he was jailed for  years. He was released in April  after serving half of his sentence. Victor and Miguel Mejia-Munera - The Twins  Victor and Miguel Mejia-Munera, two deadly brothers from Colombia, made London’s Kray twins look like pussycats. Experts in maritime logistics, they supplied Brian Wright with yacht-loads of powder before moving on to the biggest shipments ever known: multiple tonnes hidden inside huge cargo vessels known as motherships. They also commanded their own army of right-wing paramilitaries and controlled smuggling corridors through the jungle. Miguel was the warrior, Victor the financial brain. Their bloody reign came to an end when Victor was shot dead by soldiers in . Miguel was arrested and extradited to the USA, where he served a long jail term and is believed to have cooperated with the CIA. He is currently still incarcerated, awaiting repatriation to Colombia. Ahmet ‘Gigi’ Bekir - The Lord of Green Lanes  Ahmet ‘Gigi’ Bekir was the country’s first heroin kingpin. A judo expert and fitness fanatic from Cyprus, he settled in the Green Lanes area of north London, ran clubs and cafes, and sold pep pills during the ‘Mod’ era. He then went on to pioneer the sale of Turkish ‘smack’ at a time when abuse was increasing, using two smuggling methods: couriers through London’s airports and luxury cars driven overland. He was said to have imported up to £ million of narcotics when his reign was empire was busted in  and he was jailed for  years. Howard Marks - Mr Nice  Marks was the young Welshman reading Physics at Oxford University who went on to become Britain’s most famous drug smuggler. But at one point he was the mere apprentice to another student Graham Plinston, who was a sharp-minded dealing wizard. It was only when he was locked up after being caught at the Swiss-German border with a stash of hash in his car, that Marks - who had seen how lucrative his mentor’s smuggling operation was - offered to take care of business.  Marks simply loved smoking dope and could see no reason for its illegality. He also liked the money, and the excitement of trafficking: ‘I’d get a religious flash and an asexual orgasm every time I did it … It was dangerous fun.’ Marks became the country’s most notorious smuggler. He was caught for the biggest shipment ever known –  tonnes of Colombian grass – only to walk free after claiming he was an agent of MI, and was later immortalised as ‘Mr Nice’, one of his many aliases. He died of cancer in , aged . Tommy Comerford - Top Cat  By the early s Liverpool had an underworld of more than  gangsters involved in running marijuana through the city’s docks, using corrupt port workers and protected by bent police. But the main man was Tommy ‘Top Cat’ Comerford, infamous as the first person to smuggle major quantities of every illegal drug: amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, heroin and LSD. He was a flamboyant figure on the Liverpool social circuit - a regular at The Grand National and boxing dinners. But the Scouse mob was eventually routed when HM Customs dispatched two teams of elite investigators to work in the city for months at a time, and many of the top men were jailed. Comer ford spent  years of his le in prison and had been arrested again in  but died of liver cancer before he could be brought to trial. Alan Brooks and Micky Green - The Octopus Gang  Alan Brooks and Micky Green were the kings of the Costa del Crime: the sixty-mile strip of Spanish coast that became a base for exiled British villains. Brooks was a risk-taking car dealer from Blackpool who fled to Spain in the early s to avoid fraud charges Green was a former main face in the Wembley Mob of armed robbers. They formed the most daring smuggling team on the coast, and a Guardia Civil team that arrested them confiscated luxury yachts, a Ferrari, a Rolls-Royce Corniche and even a light aircraft.  Green, known as the ‘Pimpernel’ for his elusiveness, walked free and moved to Holland, while Brooks served a short jail term. Both were later convicted in their absence in France, and in  Brooks was jailed for  years for shipping almost two tonnes of coke. Green died last month of skin cancer, at the age of .

Now the words he wrote as a child in gratitude for a phone she bought him help her through the long days and nights without him. ‘Thank you mum, you’re my mate. Thank you for my phone times infinity and for everything you do. Just remember I will love you forever, no matter what.’ “This piece of paper has become really special to me,” said Debbie. “Because in my darkest hours I know he will always love me.” Today, in a moving interview almost a year on from -year-old Andrew’s senseless killing, Debbie, , tells how she is still tortured by thoughts of his final moments as he was dragged more than a mile to his death along a country lane by a getaway car, his ankles caught in a trailing strap as he tried to stop three thugs stealing a quad bike. She reveals she makes regular pilgrimages to the road where he died – because it helps her feel close to him. She speaks of her anger at the sentences handed down to his killers – Henry Long, , and -year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers. And at the sickening sight of them cheering when acquitted of murder after she was told any emotion would see her led from court. Now Debbie is pouring her grief and fury into a campaign for tougher sentences for police killers – calling for a minimum  years in jail with no early release. It comes after ringleader Long got just  years for Andrew’s manslaughter last month. Cole and Bowers each got . They were reduced from the maximum due to their ages and Long’s guilty plea. All will be eligible for release after two-thirds of their sentences in a case that sparked an outcry. Debbie, who hopes to meet Home Secretary Priti Patel about her crusade next week, said: “They celebrated when they got manslaughter instead. It looked like they’d scored the winner in the FA Cup Final – cheering and hugging each other.  Not a glimmer of remorse. Yet we were warned we couldn’t show any emotion during the case or we’d be told to leave. We had to listen to the devastating detail of what happened to Andrew and we couldn’t react. “If we cried, we cried silently, becausewe’d been visibly upset it could have been used by their defence to undermine the prosecution case. What are other criminals going to think when they see that  There’s nothing to put them off. No deterrent. There will be another case like Andrew’s. It’s just a matter of when.” Debbie recalls the day her world collapsed last August, and how their son’s violent death – just four weeks after his wedding to childhood sweetheart Lissie – haunts her day and night.  “Two police officers came to our door and we knew instantly something was wrong,” she says. “You want to refuse to hear what they’re saying. My emotions were in no man’s land.” At first she assumed her son had died in a car accident – then the horror of what happened gradually unfolded. A pathologist said Andrew was likely to have suffered a massive brain injury as soon as he collided with the road – and probably would have lost consciousness instantly. But Debbie is consumed by fear that her son was awake. She said: “I wanted to know everything, but the injuries were worse than I could have ever imagined. No one can tell me  per cent that he knew nothing about it and I’ve always had nagging doubts.  As a mum, you torture yourself. I have to train myself to think he didn’t know, because thinking about him knowing about it is just too much. It has been horrendous trying to get to sleep at night hoping he died straight away.” Shattered Debbie visited the mortuary at Reading’s Royal Berkshire Hospital four times to see his body – but her son’s injuries were so horric he had to be covered by a sheet. She said: “I just wanted to feel close to him. The first time I went I don’t think I even cried but the second time I was in floods.” Debbie also makes regular pilgrimages to the road where he died near the village of Sulhamstead, Berkshire.  She said: “It’s where he took his last breath and I feel drawn there. Maybe it’s a mum thing – I still want to be with him and protect him.” She’s also been consoled by an avalanche of support from Andrew’s colleagues, as well as other families who have lost officers in the line of duty. In the weeks after the tragedy, she received flowers from Bryn Hughes – dad of -year-old Nicola Hughes who was gunned down by serial killer Dale Cregan in . Debbie said: “They say the police is like a big family, but it’s not until something like this happens you realise it’s true. Bryn sent flowers and I contacted him and met him about a week later. He’s been so supportive.”  Despite her anguish, Debbie has taken comfort from the outpouring of love for her son. Her home near Oxford is filled with tributes from friends and strangers – from rocks painted with his badge number to teddies made of old police unorms. Yet she still finds it hard to accept he has become a household name in the most horric way. “I get on the bus and think, ‘Everyone here will have heard of my son’. But it feels like the whole world is standing beside us.”  She wishes the whole world had known her boy. “Andrew had a lovely character. As a child, he was a comical, cheeky chappy. “I recently found a video of him marching up and down, singing We’re Following The Leader from Peter Pan. “He was also so protective of his brother and sisters. He’d have made a wonderful dad. There are three years between him and Sean but he loved pushing him around in his buggy and never got jealous in the way some kids do.” Andrew became a special constable at  before joining the Thames Valley force full time. Debbie said: “He mentioned the Army but there was a lot going on in Afghanistan and I was trying to put him off. I didn’t really think about how dangerous the police could be.” Although Debbie has thrown her energy into campaigning, she is still so grief-stricken she’s been unable toto work as a university exam invigilator. She said: “Grief is unpredictable. You don’t know at any moment how it will take you. We were shopping and I was looking at Christmas ornaments. I had to put the basket down and go. When it comes, it takes you down – and it’s so physical.

The monarch, , travelled to Scotland with the Duke of Edinburgh on Tuesday for her traditional summer break. Before their arrival, courtiers spent weeks planning how the new normal would work at the castle. Due to the limited number of staff – dubbed HMS Bubble – that are in close contact with her and Philip, , no one has to wear a face mask. Their so-called social bubble includes master of the household Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Queenaposs private secretary Sir Edward Young and Paul Whybrew and William Henderson, her pages. A Buckingham Palace spokesman previously said arrangements for the Queenaposs stay in Scotland will be in line with the relevant guidelines and advice. The Queen, , will not attend church, in a bid to stop well-wishers gathering. Members of her family will not be allowed to stay in the main house and local staff have had to isolate for two weeks before her visit to ensure they are virus-free. A forensic cleaning operation is adhered to at all times, including the Queen’s red boxes of state. In order to enable Her Majesty to ride her beloved fell ponies only one groom is allowed access to her steeds. The Prime Minister’s traditional visit has also been cancelled – which is believed to have happened for the first time in her reign.  A royal aide said: Clearly, Her Majesty wanted to go to Balmoral, as normal, for August and September, but it was the practicalities and Government advice, of both England and Scotland, that had to be considered. A small number of staff have travelled from Windsor to Balmoral, where effectively a new bubble has been created. Procedures are in place to mitigate any kind of risk. No one has to wear masks in the bubble, as they are deemed safe as one household. It’s not the normal Balmoral but they’ll try and make it as normal and enjoyable as possible. The Queen and Prince Philip travelled to Balmoral in Aberdeenshire on August  and were pictured arriving by car at RAF Northolt in west London ahead of their flight. Hours after they arrived in Scotland, Aberdeen was put into local lockdown, with pubs and restaurants forced to close. A five-mile travel rule has been put in place and residents are being told not to enter each otheraposs houses and indoor and outdoor hospitality venues must close.

Whether you’re Pakistani, ­Bangladeshi or Indian, there’s one shared value – the need to sacrice personal happiness for the overall good of the family, the family name and the community. And while this is a noble value, for many Asian boys born and bred here, it can cause immense stress and anxiety which goes unrecognised in the Asian community and the wider one. My cousin Tariq, who is in his s, says while it’s great that Asian women are finally being heard, men are still suffering in silence. Being a male in this culture means you are born with responsibilities. You are the head of the family after your father, keeper of the family name and you are expected to live with your parents and look after them in their old age. You are expected to marry an Asian girl, and then your we takes over the cooking, cleaning and general household chores. This is a generalisation, but it is true for many Asian men. My cousin is a British Asian. He was born and educated here, but he was still expected to have an arranged marriage. Only trouble is, he fell in love with a non-Asian English girl in his s and she fell pregnant. He had to keep her and the child, and his love for them, a secret or risk bringing shame on the family. He was expected to go to ­Pakistan to have an arranged marriage and bring that girl back to the UK to show what a good son he was. Tariq sacriced his happiness for his cultural expectations and has suffered in silence for decades, not able to express how he felt.He has a relationship with his first son and is happy with hiswe and their children, but it has been an emotional battle – and he can’t help wondering how his le would have panned outhe had followed his heart.Mental health struggles are seen as a sign of weakness in Asian men, and many have turned to drugs and self-harming, sinking into depression, with anger and frustration turning to violence. Even in , young Asian men are facing these same pressures and expectations. It is torture for them. Many men are leading double lives, while the ­community has its head in the sand over their unhappiness and mental health. They are stereotyped beyond belief, dealing with racism and ­prejudice outside their community and being under pressure from inside it.

Doctors and scientists say the failure to properly treat troops with blast-­related traumatic brain injuries is a national scandal. Many of those suffering have been wrongly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and could now be at risk of suicide and depression. The Sunday People has also learned that three members of the SAS were forced to pay for their own flight to the United States to get treatment not ­available in the UK. The Ministry of Defence’s treatment of traumatic brain injury is based on a -day course where patients are taught how to cope with the symptoms. But in the United States, soldiers have brain scans using new technology and are then treated with hormones which can repair damaged brain tissue. One UK trauma psychotherapist who works with wounded troops believes the failure to properly treat brain damage has led to a surge in military suicides. US defence chiefs believe that up to  per cent of all troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan could have a ­traumatic brain injury . America’s Defence and Veterans Brain Injury Centre has reported that more than , troops have ­suffered it since . By comparison, the MoD says that only  troops have been diagnosed with TBI after ­serving in the same wars. Around , British troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last   years and many did ­multiple tours.  Even a conservative ­estimate based on the US percentage shows that thousands of serving and former troops could have TBI and need help. Experts claim the disparity in figures is because the British military does not screen for TBI after combat. Psychotherapist Mandy Bostwick said: “There is plenty of evidence from internationally ­renowned scientists showing that blast TBI is now the signature injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. “There is a pathway for diagnosis and treatment which works, but the Ministry of Defence believes more research needs to be done. “In the meantime, veterans are killing themselves in ever increasing numbers because they are wrongly diagnosed.”  A brain injury summit held at the Centre for Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College in London in January was attended by international experts and members of the armed forces medical services. A draft report seen by the Sunday People concluded there is an “urgent operational need to address the issues arising out of large numbers of military personnel and veterans with symptoms of blast traumatic brain injuries”. But the MoD has been calling for more research since  when the problem first surfaced in the US. Tory MP Dr Liam Fox, who at the time was shadow defence secretary, said then that the failure by the MoD to properly treat TBI victims was a dereliction of duty. He said: “Why should US troops be getting better care than British troops ”  Since , thousands of US soldiers have been treated for the condition and are now able to lead relatively ­normal lives. Treatment involves stimulating the brain with a magnetic field, then mapping it with a MEG scanner, followed by a course of endocrine hormones. In the UK, this would cost around £, to £, per patient – a similar amount to that in the US. Dr Mark Gordon, who runs the Millennium Health Centres in Los Angeles, has treated US Navy Seal special forces and attended the brain injury summit in the UK in January. He gave three SAS members and a Royal Marine a grant worth £, so they could get his treatment. He said: “As far as I am aware, they are all doing really well. We have a  per cent success rate so far. Most ­people see a signicant improvement within  days of treatment. “We have treated  military, from foot soldiers to a rear admiral, and they have ed to full activities.” Recent advances in science have shown that a TBI caused by a blast is dferent to that caused by concussion. Symptoms of blast TBI include tiredness, dizziness, aggression, memory loss, sleeplessness and problems concentrating.

Let#s not focus on these isive constitutional questions, let#s focus on rebuilding for the future.#On his trip to Glasgow and the Isle of Bute, he resisted calls for the furlough scheme to be extended beyond October.“Eight months of support from start to finish is a considerable period of time for the government helping to pay people’s wages and I just don’t think that is something that can go on indefinitely,” the Chancellor said.He argued that having people out of the labour market for a long period would not help their job prospects.“It would be easy to tell people it’s all going to be fine and that job will be there. That won’t be true for everybody and, in those circumstances, having people not attached to the labour market for that prolonged period of time is not doing them any favours.“All the academic evidence and practical economic evidence that we have on labour market outcomes tells us that. People not being attached to a workplace is not good for their long-term prospects. If it is not going to be the case that that job is going to be there, we are better off providing new opportunities and dferent types of support.”With people in Aberdeen potentially missing out on his Eat Out to Help scheme with theto lockdown, Mr Sunak appeared reluctant to make allowances for them.“We have kept it as a national scheme for the month,# he said. #We keep everything under review, but it is tricky to figure out exactly the right way to tweak that. It is complex. Hopefully what we see with these local lockdowns is that they are not going to be very long in duration,” the Chancellor said.The Federation of Small BusinessesScotland called for Aberdeen firms to receive more help.A FSB spokesman said: #The longer the Aberdeen lockdown continues, the more likely it is that businesses who, through no fault of their own, have been forced to close – or who remain open, but have seen footfall plummet – will need support.#The amount and nature of that support that will matter more to them than whether it comes from the Council, Holyrood or Westminster.  That said, we know that, as where in the UK, funds earmarked for local support grants in Scotland are underspent.  Re-purposing that cash to set up a support fund for businesses hit by local lockdowns would seem a sensible place to start.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

But that’s OK.Yes, Hemmings is almost definitely a better goal-scorer and probably a greater all-round player than his replacements but he doesn’t want to be with the Dark Blues and Danny Mullen and Alex Jakubiak do.Having watched them extensively at St Mirren in recent times, their commitment to the cause, I believe, will be immediately evident to Dundee fans.Mullen, in particular, is a passionate sort.He performs best when riled and up against it, his energy seemingly endless and with a phenomenal work-rate to boot.Prolic he is not but he is good for a goal, and no stranger to a wonder strike.The -year-old former Livingston man loves being in the final third, gets his team up the park and is surprisingly good in the air despite not being the tallest frontman.Of course, a lot of this is known to Dees, with Mullen scoring three times against them in their   relegation season.The nippy forward also bagged a crucial goal against city rivals Dundee United in the Premiership Play-off Final that term, proving he can be a man for the big occasion.A lot of Buddies fans were disappointed to see Mullen let go but their loss is the Dark Blues’ gain.He could make all the dference in getting Dundee back into the top flight.Jakubiak, too, was a favourite among the Paisley faithful and a serious target for boss Jim Goodwin.His wage demands proved too much for St Mirren so it is curious to see him at the Dee.His quality is without question, however, and paired with Mullen they may just fill Hemmings’ void.They might not have made the best start to the season but Motherwell should be the benchmark for Dundee United.Going by last term’s standings, outwith the Old Firm, ’Well are the Premiership’s top side.Despite their opening day - defeat at Ross County on Monday night, Stephen Robinson’s side hold a title United should be aiming for – the best of the rest.Third is the most anyone in Scottish football can realistically hope for with the big two from Glasgow about.And why not the Tangerines  They are one of Scottish football’s biggest and most historic clubs after all.Hearts would usually lay a claim to being Scotland’s third power but, with the Jambos now in the Championship, it’s open for a few others.Aberdeen and Hibs would be the other obvious candidates but the Steelmen have shown what can be achieved on a smaller budget.Whatever the result is at Fir Park today, the Terrors shouldhome inspired to lay claim to ’Well’s unofficial crown.The myth of English football exceptionalism persists.This week it was the wholly unexceptional Jamie O’Hara bumming up the Premier League while laying into our game at the same time.The former Tottenham midfielder claimed relegated Bournemouth would be a bigger job than European football with Rangers for Steven Gerrard.Utter nonsense.

It’s a particularly weak safeguard.Alongside this, the temptation to still carry out day-to-day activities, and the growing laxity in precautions being taken in the general population, meant it was only a matter of time before someone ed a positive test.After playing a part in a successful tournament-style season over in the US, I witnessed first-hand the protocols expected to be followed by players.As a league we were not entirely free from the controversy, as prior to our own start we also had one team caught out by the naivety of a few. This markedly similar incident resulted in the elimination of that team’s participation altogether, which was devastating to those who had followed the rules and also to the fans, sponsors and wider community who were impacted.While the final guidelines we had to follow were relentlessly strict and burdensome, they were ultimately essential to controlling the contact with anybody outside of our “bubble”.For us, partners and family were not allowed to enter our home environment after a pre-set tournament start date unless willing to also follow the safety rules.Meanwhile, trips to shops, cafes and supermarkets were absolutely forbidden for every player, and their respective household members, who had to adhere to the same sanctions once they chose to also be part of the safe zone which was created.Food was prepared and sent out through contactless delivery for every meal and the league carried out an anonymous honesty scheme, where any players caught in breach of the rules could be called out.The full guidelines we had to adhere to in the NWSL perhaps would never have been agreed to here because it would be deemed too much, but the control over exposure to any outside contact should certainly still remain one of the greatest priorities for the players and their immediate family.Theto football is something we are all excited about and hopeful for and – for players – there are additional moral obligations to act in a way which exceeds the precautions taken by the general public.Whether fair or not, the ramications and scrutiny over us is far greater than most, but ultimately we are the greatest beneficiaries because we get to play football every day and earn money doing so.Of course, we all want many things to be able toas they were before and I certainly didn’t enjoy living in the environment we were asked to in the United States.It was extremely isolating, I really missed being able to go to certain cafes and food stops and the daily tick-box requirements became draining over time. However, the bigger picture meant it was a very small ask for the benefit of having theof our game.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"golf clubs set to benefit from covid support fund","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs that have been affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic are being offered support via a funding package funded by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.In total the funding is worth £, and clubs affiliated to Scottish Golf can apply for grants being made available via two separate allocations the Covid- Fixed Costs Grant and the Club Relief Fund.Fixed Costs Grant will enable every affiliated club in Scotland to apply for aThese can include but are not exhaustive of sanitation products, Covid-related health and safety equipment, professional fees, signs, training, video conferencing licenceand any other Covid-related spend.The Club Relief Fund has been created to provide financial support to clubs who have been impacted by the pandemic and is concentrated on enabling clubs to reinstate or to increase expenditure in key areas to either improve member experience or boost income generation potential.Clubs applying to this fund are required to complete a four-stage application to ensure the review committee have the correct information available to allocate funds.The information required includes:• Standard Club Criteria and AgreementA Scottish Golf spokesperson said: #While the provision of this funding is most welcome, we do anticipate the volume of applications to be high and the criteria outlined will be strictly applied to ensure that the funds available are distributed where most needed.#We continue to explore other funding options for clubs to access and will communicate any additional opportunities should these arise.#The application process for both grants is open now until Friday July .

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"new-edwin-morgan-collection-sizzles-life-optimism","story":"Edwin Morgan, edited by Hamish WhyteCarcanet, pound.Review by By Fiona RintoulIn ldquoFrom a Nursing Home, which appears towards the end of Carcanetrsquos Centenary Selected Poems by Edwin Morgan, the poet writes of what le is like when you are ldquodown to one room. Having surveyed his table, typewriter, bed, bookcase and good book-booty, he concludes that:ldquoCareful, careless, carefree ndash we are aliveWith whatever equanimity we can musterAs time bites and burns along our veins.The only time I met Edwin Morgan was in that one room in a nursing home. Hersquod agreed to sign a copy of A Book of Lives for me. It had just come out, and Irsquod chosen a poem from it to read at a friendrsquos wedding. I wanted to give her a signed copy as a wedding present. Morgan had recently had a stroke and could barely hold the pen I handed him. The dedication was almost illegible. And yet, the poet would muster the equanimity to publish another collection of poetry before his death in  at the age of .Like all of Morganrsquos work, that last collection, Dreams and Other Nightmares: New and Uncollected Poems -, sizzles with le and a kind of magical optimism. The energy that had by then evaporated from a body battered by illness is still there in Morganrsquos writing ndash must still have zinged through his remarkable mind.Morganrsquos last poems reveal that he was more alive in his wheelchair in a Glasgow nursing home room, with Alasdair Grayrsquos portrait of him gazing down from an institutional wall, than many of us are at the height of our physical powers. One of the many reasons to pick up Carcanetrsquos Centenary Selected Poems ndash edited by Hamish Whyte, who published much of Morganrsquos poetry at Mariscat Press ndash is that it includes some of the poetrsquos brilliant and inspirational later work.Love and a Le from  is as vibrant and penetrating an examination of love and desire in all their glorious, excruciating, sometimes dangerous manestations as you are ever likely to read. Few poetscan write about romantic love with neither sentimentality nor rancour. Morgan can. In Love, he nails the whole damn business:ldquoLove is terror. Love is sweat. Love is bashed pillow, crumpled sheet, unenviablefate.Love is the honour that kills and saves and nothing will ever let that highambiguity abate.Elsewhere, yoursquoll find some of his most famous love poems, such as Strawberries and One Cigarette from his  collection, The Second Le. ldquoYou are here again, and I am drunk on your tobacco lips, writes the non-smoker of his loverrsquos left-behind fag butt smouldering in a brass ashtray. Morgan finds poetry in everything.Even the violence that accompanied le as a gay man before homosexuality was decriminalised in Scotland is described with something like beauty. In Glasgow Green, an oblique plea for understanding of the ldquosea of desire away from ldquothe beds of married love, Morgan, who did not come out until  when he was , evokes a world of forbidden encounters that has its own allure:ldquoSomewhere a shoutrsquos forced out ndash lsquoNo!rsquo ndashit leads to nothing but silence,except the whisper of the grassand the other whispers that fill the shadows.Another reason to embrace this collection is that the decade that now separates us from Morganrsquos death provides a new perspective on his towering poetic output, and its message to those us still tilling the soil in Arcadia. As this anniversary selection demonstrates, Morgan was both a patriotic Scot who supported independenceand an internationalist. Yes, these two impulses may coexist in one inidual.Morganrsquos love of his home country and home city of Glasgow is fierce ndash but it is never parochial or nationalistic. He relishes Scotland and Glasgowrsquos flaws as much as their merits. The first of the Glasgow Sonnets begins with a less than blissful portrait:ldquoA mean wind wanders through the backcourt trash.Hackles on puddles rise, old mattressespuff briefly and subside.\"ldquoYou donrsquot want the world now, do you  Come on,yoursquore pegged out on your heathery futon,take the matches from your lids, itrsquos ended.Morgan himself was never pegged out on a heathery futon. He was a breathtakingly prolic translator, moving with ease from Italian to Russian to French and Hungarian. These polyglot adventures fed his own work, which displays the linguistrsquos love of language for its own sake.But the beam of Morganrsquos imagination shone further. It probed ldquoso far from the globe, and many of his electrying space poems appear in this centenary selection. Reading ldquoIo from The Moons of Jupiter, you are there on that moon witnessing the aftermath of a volcanic eruption that killed :ldquoWe saw the men huddled in knots, or walking slowlywith bent heads over pumice beds, or stilland silent by the bank of the red lake.This is Carcanetrsquos third Selected Poems by Edwin Morgan, but the first to cover the full range of his work. For readers new to Morgan, it forms a perfect introduction, showcasing his fearless experimentation. With equal facility, he speaks in the voice of an apple, a space traveller, Baron Munchausen, even a midge:ldquoSisters, I smell supper,and what is more perfect than supper For those who already know Morganrsquos work, this selection is a welcome romp of rediscovery. It offers a reminder that he masters every form ndash from sonnets to strict rhyme schemes with free rhythm to the disintegrating word curtains of some of his early concrete poems ndash and gilds them all with the humour and humanity that infuse his own effervescent voice.That voice unites Morganrsquos disparate work ndash from the accessible to the more obscure, from the interplanetary to the Glaswegian ndash and provides the most compelling reason to revisit his oeuvre. Whether he is writing about his motherrsquos hysterectomy, the death of Marilyn Monroe or a spacemanrsquos disturbing memories of Earth, Morgan speaks with uncommon warmth and understanding.

So it is at the Scottish Gallery, or Aitken Dott when it was founded in , which has decided to burst out of lockdown in style and put on its pre-planned Art Festival show ndash by appointment only, in these times ndash along with an online series of short artist talks and events, a celebratory microcosm of what might have been, city-wide.It is, of course, easier to do this as a commercial gallery, essentially a retail establishment which will make money from the art on display rather than rely on public funding. But The Scottish Gallery also have a fine historic pedigree of artists, as shown in this all-female take on their Modern Masters series, showcasing the artists whom they have exhibited in the past century or so. There are the usual enticing big mid-century names here, for those whove saved up their pennies during lockdown, from Joan Eardley to Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, and all the better for it, alongside far less well known ones too.That, indeed, is the crux of this show, that women artists over the centuries have been historically ignored, dismissed as amateurs, allowed their tilt at the art world, much as the rare few who made it as composers were, until they were married off and into obscurity. Until the th century, it was a rare women who could, financially or socially, fend off a prospective husband for the sake of her art, much less her personal inclinations.But, as the Scottish Gallery is keen to point out, not everyone in the art world ignored or belittled women artists, although it was an institutional trait, from art schools to the galleries themselves. The Scottish Gallerys own books show their first female exhibitor in , landscape painter Mary G.W. Wilson, although there may have been others, and whilst no-one emerges unblemished from the th and th centuries, there is a formidable list here.There is ldquoA Wave, a superb energy-filled oil from Joan Eardley in her Catterline period, painted on board in the heart of a storm one anonymous night in Catterline. Here too, elements of the cityscape in pastels from her time in Glasgow, typical of her distinctive blocking and smudging of colour.Catterline appears again in the work of Lilian Neilson, who joined Joan Eardley in her studio in the small Aberdeenshire village and stayed after her friends death and then there are the quiet, reflective seascapes of Hannah Mooney, a recent graduate of Glasgow School of Art and perhaps the youngest artist in the exhibition.Elsewhere, the industrial bridgescapes of Kate Downie, the idiosyncratic visions of Pat Douthwaite and her female forms, the trees and reflective studies of Victoria Crowe. Wilhelmina Barnes-Graham, whose modernist output evolved throughout her letime, is represented here with an early St. Ives oil, and the later and ongoing abstractions, geometries and forms that would define her career.On, again, to the ink wash drawings, pastel cats and distinctive botanical watercolours of Elizabeth Blackadder, the vitality and humour of the watercolours and prints of Emily Suttons still lives, the elegant observation of Angie Lewin. There are works from Barbara Balmer, Anne Redpath, Bet Low, Frances Walker, Mardi Barrie, and many more recent, some to discover, some to rediscover, some to meet in online zoom chats, or hear discussed in the substantial series of  minute online lectures.This exhibition is, of course, the view from one gallery, and has no pretensions to being a thorough survey, but it is no less interesting for that. The figures and stories of the artists behind many of these works, particularly those of the mid-century, are the interest here, artists working in an environment where women still did not hold equal footing with men in society, yet triumphed artistically in spite of this, eventhose triumphs were not, in many cases, recognised until much later in ndash or after ndash le. In this sense, too, there wasnt really a need to qualy the title of the exhibition, which somehow makes it seem an adjunct to a male series, and the exact opposite of the intention.

Just weeks later EIF  was formally cancelled, and the  pages of the Edinburgh International Festival  programme became an irrelevance.Linehanrsquos focus moved to how his organisation could help sustain its broad range of partners, from inidual artists to Scotlandrsquos national performing companies, and from the venues his event fills that have now been dark for months to the other festivals that make Scotlandrsquos capital such an unrivalled cultural destinationldquoAfter cancellation we needed the month of April to consider where we were and what we had to do, he told me last week. ldquoIt was in May that we started dreaming things up to do in June and July. We didnrsquot want to start chasing shadows. I actually feel that we have pushed as far as we can in relation to this year and some of the other ideas that were knocking about wouldnrsquot have happened. Wersquod have ended up doing all the planning before they proved impossible.ldquoThere were ideas for the Fireworks Concert for example, but we can now see that we would not be able to be doing that. What we have been able to do is support the eco-system but not draw huge crowds of people together. None of us is in the business of that at the moment.ldquoIt took some time for us to decide how we can be useful and how we could make plans that werenrsquot just good for the Festival but were good for the arts and good for the city. Even within that we have had to walk a very fine line.The devastating effects of Covid- on the modus operandi of much of the arts may seem to put all of Edinburghrsquos Festivals in the same boat, but it also reveals major dferences between what they do and how they engage with their artists and the audience.Director Nick Barleyrsquos book festival programme has been widely praised as exemplary, for the quality of content it has maintained in a move to being an entirely online event. It is true, however, that the nature of the vast bulk of its activity ndash readings, one-to-one interviews, and an opportunity for questions ndash was well-suited to digital s.The crisis even solved some of the dficulties the book festival has in its in-tray, including the vexed issue of the remuneration of participating writers attending to promote their books and the sustainability of the New Townrsquos elegant Charlotte Square as the festivalrsquos principal venue. If it is as well delivered as it has been conceived, some of the Book Festivalrsquos loyal audience may suggest the online experience has much to recommend itself.The Fringe, on the other hand, looks a lost cause, evenits participating artists include many of the most tech-savvy in the country. Lots of old-school arts marketing wisdom hangs around the Fringe because the world-wide web is relatively useless at serving its unique character. Its audience has very little in common apart from being in the same geographical location at the same time. One of the best ways to reach it remains hand-delivering a printed leaflet person-to-person in the street. Devotees of the Fringe arrive in Edinburgh without any plan for what they might go to see and hear, and stalk the streets with an increasingly dog-eared publication as an always-flexible agenda of cultural consumption takes shape around pit-stops for food and drink. Being an inidual in a vast throng, up close with most of the performers, is the essence of the experience, and definably the one that the health emergency prohibits.ldquoWhen we were in the deepest darkest bit of this, the only lights that were on in city venues were the lsquoghost lightsrsquo on the stages, Linehan says. ldquoSo we asked people to think about that, and that led to the idea of turning on all the lights in the theatres, and going to the other extreme and lighting up the night sky.ldquoThis is a story of lsquothe Festivalsrsquo and not just us. We are utterly interdependent on each other and I think thatrsquos really come across in what we are doing. It is just as important for us to light up Summerhall and Bristo Square as it is for us to light up the Usher Hall and Festival Theatre. I hope it sends out a positive message to the world, when there is someone from CNN standing on an empty Royal Mile and saying something funereal. The artists are all still here the creativity doesnrsquot go away.The lights will come on across Edinburgh this evening as the Festivalrsquos My Light Shines On gala on BBC Scotland TV and the EIF YouTube Channel ends. Presented by Kirsty Wark and the Scottish Chamber Orchestrarsquos hugely popular cello player Su-a Lee, it will include excerpts of work filmed for the EIFrsquos online presence in Edinburgh venues by all of Scotlandrsquos national performing arts companies.ldquoAnd there are some beautul projects, says Linehan. ldquoHope Dickson Leachrsquos film for the NTS and Paul Lewis playing Beethoven are just exquisite. We also have Jenni Fagan reading in Charlotte Square, and Daniel Sloss doing stand-up in Bristo Square. Alan Cumming and Ian McKellen are calling in. It is all a bit of lsquora-ra-ra the Festivalsrsquo.Celebration is only the surface benefit of My Light Shines On in Linehanrsquos book, however.ldquoWe asked people how we could be useful. We talked to companies who had the capacity to move on to the next stage, and in footballing terms it is the equivalent of playing behind closed doors as opposed to showing reruns of old matches. We are doing Festival projects in theatres and in concert halls but without the audience. It is the first time the orchestras and dance companies have been able to come together and it was incredibly complicated, as it is for sport.ldquoThat has had two big effects. It creates the protocols and the systems for people to be able to come back together again in the venues, and that is the big thing that performing artists have been longing for.ldquoAnd practically it meant more than  people working on this and being paid to do so, and that is hugely important. To be blunt about it, the process has been just as important as whatever the outcome is. I canrsquot tell you how complicated it was to put the SCO back together again on a stage, or the dancers of Scottish Ballet.ldquoPutting all that back together, contracting people and giving those venues rental was our job ndash and then lighting up the city over what would have been our opening weekend without attracting big crowds. It is a very practical programme built around resilience and solidarity that hopefully will send out a positive and optimistic message.ldquoThis has been a very practical exercise. People need to be engaged and contracted again and what is key is how we give meaningful and valuable work to people over the next year in a way that has value for the widest possible community. That is going to be a big challenge. There are lots of other things we could do in terms of profile, repurposing stuff from the archive, which is lovely, but it doesnrsquot address the big questions that we need to wrestle with.Grappling with the legacy of Covid-,and when it is no longer a clear and present danger, also has implications for Linehan personally, who had planned to end his tenure as festival director with the th event in .ldquoOne thing we do have is a bit of time, he says cautiously, ldquoand I am conscious of the degree to which we are normally hurtling towards another Festival and delivering it properly and balancing the books, and that takes a lot of your creative energy.ldquoThe  anniversary celebrations now take on a dferent tone because I need to make sure that the Festival is as robust as possible. We need to take a slightly longer perspective and start thinking about . What does coming out of the crisis look like My Light Shines On is broadcast on BBC Scotland TV and the EIF YouTube channel from .pm tonight, with the full versions of the work showcased in the gala available online thereafter. e"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-us-really-ever-change","story":"But I may have a point, in some ways. There are other nine-year-olds in that old school picture of mine and I remember them well. One of them, Alex, is standing next to me, scowling out from beneath his fringe. Much later, when he was grown up, Alex became a heroin addict and was hit by a car while he was high and killed instantly, aged . I only found out years later, when someone mentioned it to me, casually. Did I know Alex was dead Therersquos change for you: a bit of my childhood broken off. Alex and I had a dficult relationship. He could be bit of a bully to be honest, but he was only nine and so was I, and one day, when wersquod got into a fight in the playground, I suddenly got the better of him for once and pinned him down and said, ldquoWhat you going to do now, eh  and that was that the fighting stopped and we became friends. Sort of.I find another picture. . The year before the school photo was taken. Oldmeldrum Highland Games in Aberdeenshire, warm, sunny, happy, and there in the middle of the photo, driving towards us in an open-top Rolls Royce ndash in Aberdeenshire! in the s! ndash is the actress Diana Dors ndash in Aberdeenshire! in the s! I didnrsquot know it then of course, but the reason Diana Dors was at Oldmeldrum Highland Games was because her career had hit the skids and she was opening country fetes for cash. I thought it was exciting. She probably felt dead inside. But therersquos change for you: she was a film star once.I put the pictures in a pile and sort through some books that need organising and therersquos a copy of Michael Palinrsquos diaries from the s and s, my childhood. I flick through them and change seems to back off again. Therersquos an entry from November  thatrsquos like a Monty Python sketch: Michael is in a book shop in Edinburgh and an irate lady mistakes him for the shopkeeper and tells him she feels cheated because the book about angling she bought for her nephew has two pages stuck together. Maybe the woman was Terry Jones in a dress doing the Spam voice. These pages are stuck together! Itrsquos a scam, scam, scam!But itrsquos the other entries in Palinrsquos diaries ndash interesting, anxious little snippets from the past ndash that really hang around in my brain. He mentions Scottish politics and says that he hopes that, one day, Scotland will be independent. December st : ldquoI would like to see Wales and Scotland as independent nations and I think itrsquos going to happen as people gets less and less satisfaction from being part of a big international wodge.He also rages against the Tories. April st, : ldquoSensitivity, tolerance, understanding and conciliation is a spirit utterly alien to the Thatcher-inspired politics of the s, he writes. And where in the diaries, despite all his success in comedy and films, he worries that he might not be good enough.None of that has changed, has it  Wersquore still angry. We still worry. At one point, Palin notices how much his face has aged ndash and thatrsquos a change that certainly cannot be resisted ndash but the Tories are still the Tories and worries are still worries and, reading the diaries, I feel the connection from now to then and the sense of what hasnrsquot altered at all. There they were: all those people in , including Michael Palin, complaining about the state of things and wanting reform, and herersquos , with lots of people complaining about the state of things and wanting reform. Itrsquos the thing that doesnrsquot change, ever: the desire for change.And now that Irsquom back in the s and s, rummaging about in the years that have gone, I remember something  about that picture of me at school in Torry, Aberdeen, in . t was the year I created a school magazine. I appointed myself editorand chief writerand commissioned myself to write a review of The Krankies at the Capitol theatre and a story about a pair of magic skis. My writing was cobbled together and amateurish and childish andsome people say it still is. You see: nothing changes.So, I tidy the pictures away, and put Palinrsquos diaries up on the shelf, but the photograph from  ndash the one of me next to my teacher and Alex, the boy who died ndash is staying out on my desk. Itrsquos propped up against the wall where I can see it and it reminds me and warns me. It reminds me of the stuff that changes and the stuff that doesnrsquot.

Much of the Government rhetoric has been encouraging people to go out and spend money again in order to boost the hospitality industry. As a part of the younger generation, I can understand the enthusiasm for supporting this industry, as it provides jobs for so many people my age. In a time when unemployment is looming larger than ever as a real issue, when young people are facing the prospect of a le without job security and pension plans, it is understandable that so many of us are desperate for le toto some semblance of ldquonormal.Much of the media coverage of this issue paints young people as selfish. It suggests that we are disregarding the current restrictions completely in order to enjoy ourselves. However, I would argue that there are people across every generation who have that attitude, as much as there are people across every generation who are doing their best to follow the regulations and prevent the virus spreading.It seems that the media is jumping the gun in presuming that all young people who have contracted Covid- from a bar or restaurant were ignoring the rules in place at these establishments. There is no evidence to explain exactly how they contracted the virus. It is worth considering that some of them may have been trying to stick to the regulations and simply fallen foul of circumstance. Perhaps the media should provide young people with the benefit of the doubt before starting a witch hunt.And perhaps, whilst the government come up with a master plan on how to stop young people spreading the virus, they should also consider how they can support this generation going forward.Catherine Eckersall, Balfron.WHERE was Police Scotland last week when huge crowds were witnessed outside Soul Bar on Union Street in Aberdeen with no social distancing  Police were seen walking past. These people should have been dispersed and the venue closed down, which might have assisted in reducing positive cases. The economy of Aberdeen has been seriously adversely affected.There has been a serious dereliction of duty from our national police force and I hope the organisation is seriously reprimanded by the boss, Nicola Sturgeon. She could always call on Kenny MacAskill, architect of the politically-controlled force, for support.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.CITIZENS of Aberdeen have been told by the First Minister to travel no more than five miles for leisure as Covid- spikes in the city.

The Deputy First Minister has been a sterling defender of the First Minister, the ultimate safe pair of hands. But those hands arent looking so safe any more. He is beginning to look like a work horse that has taken more beating than it can stand.A fresh face,such a thing exists in the  year old Scottish Government, in charge of the education brief might help get the government over this hurdle. In the last SQA exams crisis in  the then Labour education minister, Sam Galbraith, had to step down after being mauled by, er, one Nicola Sturgeon.The SNP is streets ahead in the polls and that is unlikely to change any time soon, given the dire state of the opposition parties in Scotland. But there are a lot more parents in Scotland than there are teachers. It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt. She will have to get a grip or face an unmoderated ldquofail in May.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It is, however, worth looking at the options. The first one would have been not to certicate this year that would have been a severe blow to candidates, effectively costing them a year of their le. The second option was to use centre evidence such as prelim materials, on which to base results. For this to happen even on the basis of sampling, this required a large number of examiners in markersrsquo meetings to set and enforce common standards, at a time when offices were shutting and the SECC was being converted to the Louisa Jordan. By default,certication was to take place at all, it had to happen on the basis of centre estimates.Using estimates by candidatesrsquo own teachers has merits ndash the teachers know the candidates. It also has drawbacks ndash the teachers know the candidates. In addition, there may be pressure from parents. For whatever reason, in overall terms the raw estimates of passes provided by teachers were not at the level of around  per cent as in previous years, but nearer  per cent. This is the crux of the problemteachers had estimated in line with past awards, for their centres and overall, the fall-out would have been much less.Here too it is instructive to look at the options. The SQA could have accepted all the estimates and certicated a uniquely high pass rate in a year when there had been less teaching than in the past, this would have tainted the awards forever. Alternatively, SQA could have reduced all awards to previous levels that would have meant almost no centre or pupils would have achieved their estimated grades were there to be an appeals system in place, every candidate would have been eligible. That was not a sustainable position. The third option was to align awards on the basis of which centres had been most accurate in providing estimates in the past. While not perfect, there is no other game in town. The drawback in this system is that candidate performance is more iable and less predictable in areas of greater social deprivation candidates face a range of pressures both inside and particularly outside school that impact on performance, especially in external examinations. This indeed is what happened but, again, there was no other viable option and it would seem that the SQA did apply some mitigation of these effects.He was right on the second count too. Much of the criticism seems politically motivated. Unionists of all hues take an unseemly delight in blaming the SNP Government for this unfortunate coincidence of circumstances. Back in , when StQA experienced another crisis, the blame was directed largely at the SQA, rather than the Labour-LibDem coalition which had foisted Higher Still upon it.Laurence Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.THE recent outcry over the SQA awards shows how biased, outdated and unfair this qualications body is. Had all centres been downgraded then it would just have shown how distrustful it is of teachers. However, the unfairness of its awards is clearly evidenced by the fact that the predicted grades of private schools have been upgraded whilst those of secondary schools in less affluent areas have been downgraded.Having worked in both sectors I know that not all pupils attending private schools are particularly clever. Indeed many parents choose to send their children there either because they are not especially clever, or because they do not have the aptitude for learning. I know that there are many exceptions to this and I also know that there are many pupils in state secondary schools who also are reluctant learners. However, I have also had the privilege and pleasure of teaching many pupils in state schools who have been truly gted and have gone on to professions such as medicine, law and in academia itself. I am just thankful that their merit was not judged in such a cavalier fashion as the present students have been.What this fiasco shows is that an examination of the SQA is long overdue. Having worked as a marker for it I found it a very heavy-handed and arrogant institution. No-one was ever allowed to question decisions about exemplar marked scripts we were given, even when some were very dubious. Now I mark for GCSE Literature and the attitude down south is very dferent. There, there is competition between examining bodies and, as a result, not only are markers treated as professionals, but our questions and, sometimes objections, are listened to and acted on. I think itrsquos about time that the monopoly of the SQA should be challenged.Rita Carey, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon rejects criticism from Professor Lindsay Paterson, one of Scotlandrsquos leading experts on education, that the basis for reducing grades had been ldquoarbitrary. So all of a sudden, Ms Sturgeon is an expert of equal standing on education. I know who I believe and so will thousands of school children in mostly deprived areas, who did well in their course work and prelims, but were strangely marked down and who dont believe her withering excuses either.It is also very strange why this year the appeals process is free, which makes me think the SNP knew the results were skewed against our less well-off areas, and has very quickly granted free access to appeals.Michael Miller, Falkirk.PRESCRIBED text for John Swinney: The Leadership Class in Scottish Education by Walter Humes .

Despite the economic ravages of Covid, it will not be a financial debt that we will start racking up. It will be far worse than that.August  has officially been declared Earth Overshoot Day. It is the moment in the annual calendar when humanityrsquos demand for ecological resources and services starts to exceed what nature can regenerate.At that moment, environmentally, we begin to borrow beyond our means. In fact, itrsquos actually worse than that. It means that for the final  days of , we are effectively stealing from the ecosystem.As we all share one planet, this is obviously a major problem for the whole of humanity. Scotland, however, is making a greater contribution than many other countries in working to offset this ecological deficit.We have long recognised that our natural environment is our greatest national asset. It not only sustains our health and wellbeing, but also boosts our economy in general and rural areas in particular.Food, whisky, renewable energy and tourism are all sectors which all bring in revenue as well as leveraging off our reputation as one of the greenest countries on the planet.Despite our reputation as a global leader in tackling climate change ndash we have the most ambitious set of statutory targets in the world - Scotland faces many of the same challenges as other countries. Growing carbon emissions threaten ecosystems everywhere, driving loss of bioersity and threatening all our futures.The need for urgent action has never been clearer, but there is at least a strong determination in this country to address the issues. One important bioersity initiative is a new pound billion routemap for nature conservation published by the Scottish Wildle Trust and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency .Its proposals include a Marine Fund ndash also backed by RSPB Scotland among others ndash to restore habitats, develop innovative management approaches and help with the recovery of species such as puffins.Other investment opportunities highlighted include introducing nature-based carbon payments taking a Net Positive for Nature approach a Nature-Climate Bond and nature-based carbon payments.Terry ArsquoHearn, Chief Executive of SEPA, comments: ldquoThe challenge provides an opportunity to bring together real world projects that spark regeneration of communities, build green businesses and create new jobs.Scotlandrsquos farmers have a crucial role in protecting our futures. If agricultural land is not used optimally, the results can be extremely damaging and have a number of linked outcomes.As an example of this, the Aberdeenshire-based James Hutton Institute points out that the decline in sheep numbers seen in recent decades can cause undergrazing.This in turn may mean changes in vegetation and loss of particular habitats, with a consequent negative effect on species.The institute argues for the adoption of High Nature Valuefarming, which supports low intensity agricultural systems. It says there is a case to be made for additional financial support to promote this.In order to protect the environment, we need to nurture not just the land, but the seas around us. Again, this is an area in which Scottish scientists are taking a lead.Edinburgh University is co-ordinating the ambitious, EU-funded iAtlantic project ndash the biggest initiative of its type ever mounted in the planetrsquos second largest ocean.It will assess its state of health, mapping uncharted parts for the first time and assessing the effects of climate change on plants and animals.Sonar and D modelling will be used and the end result will be a full digital map of the oceanrsquos ecosystem. Part of the project involves identying safe haven areas where marine le can be nurtured and prosper. The findings will be passed to governments around the world in the hope that they will take action.Scotlandrsquos own new environment strategy, published earlier this year just before the start of the Covid- outbreak, recognises the effort and achievements to date but acknowledges that there is still work to do.The Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, says she is proud of the progress made to date.ldquoWe have the toughest, most ambitious framework on climate change in the world and have almost halved our greenhouse gases since , she adds. ldquoWe are recognised as leaders in developing a circular economy and have some of the most ambitious targets on waste in Europe.The report acknowledges the issues raised by Earth Overshoot Day, pointing out that while climate change is a key driver of loss of bioersity, natural habitats play a critical role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.These are the consequences, it says, of stretching the Earthrsquos systems beyond their sustainable limits.The report continues: ldquoThe need for action is clear. Tackling the crises will require urgent, transformative changes in economies and societies around the world.ldquoThis must promote a fairer distribution of resources between the rich developed world and poorer countries, who will be the first to suffer the effects of climate change and ecosystem collapse. Scotland is already making progress towards this transformation.What action can be taken to address what is the most important and defining problem of our age  Several ambitious initiatives are already underway.These include the State of Nature Scotland report, published in , which provides the countryrsquos clearest picture yet on bioersity. Woodland creation schemes are being implemented and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is providing the science needed to support the conservation of plants and fungi. One particular investigation is examining how rare Scottish mountain plants are being jeopardised by a loss of genetic ersity.Urban areas can also have an effect, both positive and negative, on the ecosystem. Decarbonisation of transport and a move towards walking and cycling will obviously make an impact, and it may well be that one result of the Covid- pandemic is a green-focused reimagining of our towns and cities.The Scottish Land Commission has helped to establish the Vacant and Derelict Land Taskforce. Bringing abandoned and unloved urban places back into productive use could help tackle climate change, improve health and wellbeing, create more resilient communities and assist in rebuilding the economy.Recommendations will be submitted to the Scottish Government later in the year. The commission is also preparing advice on the creation of a Regional Land Use Partnership, in order to ensure that all of Scotland can contribute to our climate targets.Sadly, we will probably be marking Earth Overshoot Day for years to come. But in Scotland, we can at least take comfort in the fact that we are taking plenty of action to help ensure that over time, we stop drawing down the capital of our greatest asset: the planet itself."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-get-quizzical","story":"Question  Do you read the Herald Diary a Yup.

When she ran for Scottish Tory leader in  it was a bitter affair, with her three rivals, including Mr Carlaw, complaining she was being unfairly helped by party HQ.The partyrsquos spindoctor at the time, Ramsay Jones, who was supposed to be neutral in the race, was found to have been at her house on the night of a campaign meeting. She denied hersquod been part of it, but later admitted the pair ldquoprobably did get on to the campaign at some point. Mr Jones was suspended, and left to work in Downing Street.

Five Douglas Ross for Leader websites were registered within an hour of Mr Carlaw announcing his departure. Suspicious or just devilishly efficient In fact, there is a smoking gun. Well, some smoking metadata. Mr Rossrsquos campaign website carries a lsquoDouglas Ross for Leaderrsquo logo, and embedded in that logo, for those who know how to find it, is an electronic timestamp which shows it was created just before Mr Carlawrsquos resignation statement. Now that is uncommonly fast work.Well, so what, you may think. Politicians will be politicians.But other Holyrood stories this week showed why the Ross-Davidson flannel could have wider signicance.The inquiry into the Alex Salmond affair will be one of the biggest things on Ms Davidsonrsquos plate when she s to FMQs. It will be her job to prosecute the case for the Tories and wound Ms Sturgeon and the SNP ahead of the election.This week, we learned the FM withheld details of a relevant meeting about Mr Salmond from MSPs last year, and the Scottish Government also withheld reams of evidence from the inquiry on legal grounds.The Scottish Tories are now demanding full transparency.It will not be easy for Ms Davidson.Always remember that Ms Sturgeon was a lawyer before Holyrood.Her words are precisely chosen.I doubt very much that she directly misled MSPs with a bald lie.However it does look asMSPs have been misled by omission, with the First Minister telling them bits of the truth, but not the whole truth, and then letting a  impression take hold and doing nothing to correct it.But anyone planning to attack her on transparency grounds, with these high stakes, needs to be spotless, the very model of transparency.Questions over Ms Davidson and Mr Rossrsquos candour, and the series of extreme coincidences leading up to Mr Carlawrsquos departure, offer Ms Sturgeon a glimpse of a way out.lsquoWhy should I take lectures from this humbug with her record  Who is she to judge me rsquo she may say.Besides insulting our intelligence, Ms Davidson has already hamstrung herself in the contest to come."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11561817.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-benedetti-says-poor-leadership-costing-jobs","story":"The Grammy Award-winning Scottish musician told Scala Radio that the prospects for musicians ldquodo not look good amid the coronavirus pandemic.Benedetti added that it is dficult to speak openly about the issue because ldquoeverything has been moralised and politicised so fiercely.She said: ldquoI just donrsquot believe that the route wersquove taken is the best we could have done.ldquoI think incompetency, vested interests in the wrong areas, I think just a lack of care, a lack of leadership, disorganisation, just bad management I think has gone on left, right and centre and itrsquos costing people their livelihoods.:Bands and venues back appeal to save Scottish music industryMusicians work in one of the most heavily restricted industries, she said, adding: ldquoOur prospects do not look good any time soon.ldquoWe canrsquot see a clear end in sight that provides any sort of working business model.ldquoItrsquos not just musicians, itrsquos everybody involved in that ecosystem.Last month, the Government announced a pound. billion support package for the arts which will be used to help organisations including music venues, theatres, museums and galleries.Household names from across Scotland signed a lettercalling on the government to supportmusicbusinesses ldquobefore it is too late.:Edinburgh: The story behind this years FestivalThe newly established Scottish Commercial Music Industry Taskforce wrote to Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop calling for more money for the music industry, clarity onartsfunding and a timeline for venues reopening without social distancing.Artists who put their name to the letter included KT Tunstall, Mogwai, The Proclaimers, Texas, Bfy Clyro, and Simple Minds."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-coronavirus-cluster-rises-110-cases","story":"A total of  new cases have been detected in the NHS Grampian area in the last  hours, though the health board said it could not confirm how many were linked to the outbreak.It said  close contacts of detected cases in the cluster have been identied, and will be required to self-isolate.This is up on the  close contacts reported on Friday.:Local lockdown: Covid- restrictions being reintroduced in AberdeenSusan Webb, director of Public Health for NHS Grampian, said: ldquoThere has been a substantial rise in the number of close contacts which is not entirely unexpected.ldquoWe speak to detected cases more than once, as we know they will recall dferent details as they reflect on what they have been doing and where, and who they have met.ldquoWe remain extremely grateful for the support and co-operation of each of them, the information they provide ensures our investigation can be as thorough as possible.Here is the latest news from @NHSGrampian regarding Covid-  the Aberdeen cluster.Aberdonians please answer your phones even itrsquos a number you donrsquot know as it may be Test  Protect.

The captain of the nuclear-powered sub radioed for permission to attack.The defence secretary, following Cabinet agreement, later recalled that it was the easiest decision he had to make.At :, on May , the torpedo tubes were loaded with three unguided Mark VIII torpedoes with impact fuses and and -pound warheads. These missiles pre-dated the Second World War but were reliable for the close-range attack, unlike with the latest wire-guided Mark  Tigerfish torpedoes, which captain and crew found unreliable.At three minutes before pm the captain ordered the firing of the torpedoes.The first stuck the target near the bow, essentially blowing it off. The second detonated in the machine room and tore through the crewrsquos nearby mess area which was full of sailors changing sht. The blast killed  of its , crew.The side-effect,it can be so described, destroyed the shiprsquos electricity systems, knocking out the pumps and making it impossible to send out a distress call. The third torpedo missed entirely, struck a nearby ship but failed to explode.The cruiser which was now listing badly to port was a -year-old American-built warship that had survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.In , it had been sold to Argentina and renamed the ARA General Belgrano. It would not see out  and survive the Falklands War.When he was asked later about the sinking of the Belgrano, the Conquerorrsquos captain, Chris Wreford-Brown, responded wryly: ldquoThe Royal Navy spent  years preparing me for such an occasion. It would have been regarded as extremely drearyI had fouled it up.The Sun newspaper greeted the sinking of the Belgrano with surely the most infamously memorable headline of its controversial le ndash GOTCHA ndash although the text claimed the sinking of another Argentine ship.The Belgrano had been sunk outside the -mile maritime exclusion zone that Britain had imposed around the Falklands and, according to reports, had actually been heading for port.There had been a Peruvian peace proposal  hours earlier, which Britain would later acceptand in a live television interview on BBCrsquos Nationwide the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, denied that she had received it. The Belgrano was a threat to British ships, she said, justying the action.In the Green Room after the show, Thatcherrsquos husband Denis, drink in hand, lashed out at the producer saying that his we had been ldquostitched up by bloody BBC p**fs and Trots.The controversy over the sinking did not end with the war .And it simmered in the most unlikely place, inside the Civil Service in the Ministry of Defence.At the time, Clive Ponting was a -year-old senior official, an assistant secretary, earning pound, a year, more than pound, today. He was in charge of the MoDrsquos Defence Secretariat  and was heading for the very top.Thatcher had told the House of Commons the Belgrano was steaming towards the -mile exclusion zone imposed by Britain around the Falklands when she was torpedoed, with the loss of  of the shiprsquos company.However, Ponting had drafted two papers stating that the cruiser had altered course and was moving away from the zone.When his papers, which became known as the Crown Jewels, were withheld from the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Ponting, in July , sent the two documents in the post to the Labour MP for Linlithgow, Tam Dalyell. The documents revealed that the Belgrano had been sighted a day earlier than officially reported, and was steaming away from the Royal Navy task force, and outside the exclusion zone, when attacked and sunk.Dalyell had resigned from the shadow Cabinet over the reconquest of the Falklands and was as voluble opponent of Thatcherrsquos. He had spoken in Parliament against the action and was therefore an obvious destination for the ldquojewels. Dalyell realised they were political dynamite.He passed them to the select committee, whose chairman contacted the defence secretary Michael Heseltine, who then ordered a leak inquiry.The papers were soon traced to Ponting, who was interviewed by two MoD police officers, who told him they were not sure an offence had been committed. They suggested he quietly resign.However, ministers demanded his prosecution. It came in the wake the MoDrsquos embarrassment over the case of Sarah Tisdall, a junior civil servant jailed the year before for sending photocopies of documents concerning the deployment of US cruise missiles in Britain to . On August ,  ndash  years ago next week ndash Ponting was charged under Section  of the  Official Secrets Act.His defence, before a security-vetted jury, was that he had leaked, and to an MP, in the public interest. The judge, Mr Justice McCowan, was having none of it ndash he had considered halting the trial and giving the jury a direction to convict ndash and in his summing up he said ldquothe public interest is what the government of the day says it is.Ponting was convinced he was going to be jailed, so much so that he brought his toothbrush and the sayings of Buddha to court for the verdict. But when it came, which no doubt enraged the judge, he was found innocent. He immediately resigned from the Civil Service and weeks later published his first book, The Right To Know, then joining the politics and international relations department at Swansea University.The acquittal also enraged the Conservative-dominated Commons and, in , a new Official Secrets Act came into force, which removed the defence of acting in the public interest, on which Ponting had relied. Ponting was no archetypal rebel.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.A letter of apology was also issued by BBC Northern Ireland#s head of news, Adam Smyth, in response to the complaint.In the letter, Mr Smyth said the BBC#s editorial guidelines in this area have been reinforced with news teams.Newcastle was the scene of a major Covid- cluster in recent days.Three businesses in the town reported outbreaks of the virus among staff this week.One of the businesses Kent Amusements, located on the Central Promenade, announced on social media it was closing until further notice.A Covid- testing unit has been opened at St Mary#s Primary School in Newcastle.Local Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard welcomed the move.He said: I am encouraging anyone in the Newcastle area who has developed COVID- symptoms to avoid contact with others and to urgently get tested for the virus.

We can’t afford to wait and see.”It comes amid mounting concern about the virus in Northern Ireland.On Thursday the Department of Health reported  new cases — the highest daily total since May .Yesterday a further  cases were confirmed.The R number — the virus’s reproductive rate — is estimated to be around ., meaning it is spreading exponentially again.In England and Scotland, health officials have moved to tighten restrictions on towns and cities where cases have surged, including Aberdeen, Leicester and Manchester.And yesterday the Department of Health said similar measures could be taken here. A spokesperson: “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-. In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.”In Kildare, Laois and Offaly, residents will not be allowed to travel outside of their counties except for in limited circumstances, including travel to and from work. Restaurants, bars, cinemas and gyms will be closed.In Northern Ireland, the daily number of coronavirus cases is now around three times the level seen in early July. However, numbers remain well below those recorded earlier in the year. At the height of the crisis in April,  cases were confirmed on one day.Yesterday Prof Young said he did not necessarily expect a spike but added: “I will not be surprisedthe number of cases increase signicantly”.“I certainly hope we do not have to go back to the lockdown and we will do everything possible I’m sure to avoid that evenother measures need to be taken.”Meanwhile, figures published by Northern Ireland’s statistics agency now link  deaths to the virus.Nisra’s weekly bulletin showed there was one death here in the past week where Covid- is thought to have been a factor.Its figures are separate to those collated by the Department of Health, which count mainly hospital deaths.The department’s data is based on deaths where a patient recently tested positive for the virus.Belfast Most ReadBBC Newsline apologises for broadcasting interviewee#s #Covid conspiracy# claimPolice attacked during bonfire removal in west Belfast -  officers injured Coronavirus: Local lockdowns could be used for NI clustersArlene Foster denounces Taoiseach Micheal Martin#s #disappointing# comment on NILaw society investigating leading NI solicitors’ firm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But most of all we need the public to support our industry.Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industryhas set our six ways of coping in the event of a local lockdown.The organisation#s Northern Ireland director Angela McGowan it#s about building confidencenew temporary restrictions are implemented.Businesses know thatinfection rates spike in an area then new local lockdowns may well be required to protect public health, she said.Local lockdowns are how governments manage the risk of infection and reopening the economy safely, so we must get good at them. The local Executive will need to act fast on new information, so there may be limited notice, but we must aim for a #no surprises# approach as far as possible.

There are a two distinct political jurisdictions born out of the Good Friday Agreement - we have acknowledge the reality of that, Mr Martin said.

What happensEngland gets turned off Northern Ireland  We#ve got to be thinking all this through, he added.This prompted Mrs Foster to denounce the comments, remarking that the rest of the UK cannot sever its constitutional links with Northern Ireland, pointing out that a united Ireland can only be achieved with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as outlined in the Belfast Agreement.

The priest spoke of his compassion, referring to how he comforted families bereaved in the  Greysteel massacre.In a time in our world when often small mindedness and self-focus seems to be the driver, John never put anybody or any specic group first.

Ulster Unionist Party councillors on Belfast City Council Jim Rodgers and Sonia Copeland have criticised Sinn Fein Councillor Ronan McLaughlin over his comments that Roselawn cemetery is unwelcoming for Roman Catholics.There is not a grain of truth in this statement, the two councillors said on Friday.Last week, Belfast Sinn Fein councillor Ronan McLaughlin told a Belfast City Council meeting that the city#s nationalist and republican community believes that the Roselawn cemetery and crematorium is not a welcome place for them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRonan McLaughlin of Sinn Fein FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRonan McLaughlin of Sinn FeinCouncillor McLaughlin made the remarks as he requested an additional equality assessment into plans to locate Northern Ireland#s second crematorium in Roselawn, close to the existing one.A second facility for the site is planned, with an estimated cost in the region £m, and which it#s expected will take up to two years to build. The existing building - which is listed - will be refurbished inside and used by staff.At a meeting of the council#s strategic policy and resources committee meeting, Councillor McLaughlin said: What we have seen recently in Roselawn is the display of what can only be described as a hate banner that was very sectarian in nature.Me and my party colleagues have had people contacting us, families of recently deceased people, who are concerned about Roselawn.There is a perception within the Catholic, nationalist, republican community that Roselawn is not a welcome place for them.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At this stage people will be familiar with the motorcade to Stormont in protest over Lockwoods decision, he added. But he says, as signicant, was a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ where a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said concerns had been raised by constituents whose requests for their license renewals to be issued in Irish were not honoured. “The right to have your details printed in Irish on your licence is protected within the European Charter for Regional and Minority languages,” she said. “Following the commitment to an Irish Language Act within New Decade, New Approach, I would have hoped that the use of Irish on official documents would be encouraged within agencies, as opposed to prevented. googletag.cmd.push “I was contacted by a family who had applied for their licence renewals to reflect their fluency in the language, and to have their names and addresses in Irish on their Photographic licences, and was concerned that their demand had not been acted upon by DVA staff. “A driving licence, like any official ID, is often a source of pride and an opportunity to express ourselves. “It is therefore key that citizens have their identity expressed as they wish on theirlicence, not as another would interpret it.” The Department of Infrastructure has confirmed applicants may request their name in Irish on their license. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson said: “An applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence may, at any time, request that their name appears in traditional form. “Such a request does not constitute a change of name and the applicant or holder is not required to provide identity documentation bearing the name in Irish. “Where an applicant for, or holder of, a Northern Ireland driving licence requests that the address is displayed in Irish, such a request will be met provided the relevant council confirms that the street name has been legally adopted. “Currently this does not extend to other addresses.It was agreed in New Decade New Approach that the Executive Office would bring forward language legislation and appoint a Commissioner to protect and enhance use of the Irish language. “It is important that this legislation is brought forward as soon as possible, and I will seek to ensure that my department plays its role and fulfils its commitments.” Ms Sheerin welcomed the Department’s response and clarication. She said: “I am delighted that the minister has written to me to confirm that this was an error, and that the department understand it is a persons right to have their name printed in Irish. “Where their council has a street sign policy in place which has legally adopted their street or road into Irish, they are entitled to have their address displayed as such.” Ms Sheerin also confirmed the constituents had now received their licenses with their names printed in Irish.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A delivery van was hijacked at Rathlin Drive in the estate on Tuesday afternoon before being set on fire. It was one of three vehicles hijacked in Derry on Tuesday. Local politicians condemned the hijackings and said they had destroyed the livelihoods of the workers involved. Community workers today said there were widespread concerns about the attacks in Creggan this week. In a joint statement, Conal McFeely, Tony O’Doherty, Shauna Deery and Gerry Quinn of Creggan Neighbourhood Partnershipsaid there were also concerns about police activity in Creggan which included, they said, house raids, stop and search tactics and other disruption activity by the TSG   TIU . googletag.cmd.push “We, as the community, need to listen and to speak out, to ensure that everyone fully understands the negative consequences of such events and the social, economic and reputational damage to iniduals, families and the wider community,” the statement said. “Creggan has been fully compliant to public health guidance, and extremely resilient and considerate during the Covid lockdown – an exemplar in how a community should respond to a crisis. “According to current statistics, this area has among the lowest reported crime figures in the city and, contrary to the widely-reported, albeit ill-informed, perception, Creggan is in fact a very safe and caring community. googletag.cmd.push “The last number of weeks, however, have seen a number of serious incidents which we believe require further investigation. “CNP believe there is an underlying context to this week’s disturbances, which has gone largely unreported and hence has, again, led to a very one-sided picture of this area being portrayed.” The community workers said young people and families had told them that they are being deliberately targeted by highly aggressive, frightening and quasi-legal policing procedures tactics. “And it is incumbent on us, as a socially-just community, to take account of all available evidence, to establish a full and fair perspective of the situation. “CNP in no way condone or excuse the activities leading to the physical, mental and reputational damage done by, or to, any person or property in this community. “We are aware, however, that there is a specic context to recent events – this response did not happen out of nowhere. “And we also believe that there is a responsibility on all of us to examine that context and engage with young people and local residents – both to listen to their concerns and to ensure that they understand the extremely negative consequences of the destruction of community or private property, and the knock-on affects in relation to the traumatic impacts on affected iniduals and the denial of public services to the area. “There is a growing concern about the ‘cause and effect’ nature of ongoing police activity in the area and recent community disturbances. “Many within this community believe that current police actions only serve to undermine public confidence in policing and indeed the independence and effectiveness of the local and regional police oversight bodies which are supposed to hold police to account. “Our public representatives and church leaders should be concerned, and not be afraid to speak out, about how our area is being policed and is being impacted by the resulting destruction of community or private property.” The Creggan community workers said that following a process of mediation with relevant groupings, it has been established that there is no impediment to the resumption of all delivery and maintenance services in the area. “Tensions are high in the area at the moment – there is a great deal of hurt and frustration which needs to be acknowledged and the specic reasons for these sentiments need to be explored. “CNP believe there is a critical need for an independent review of the recent disturbances – and their context – and will engage inclusively with the entire community to ensure that any such process will be as fair and transparent as possible.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Photo: Press Eye PA WireThe scale of support required to help firms deal with the paperwork is testament to how serious the barriers to trade and business will become now that Northern Ireland is to be left behind as a colony of the EU, semi-detached from the rest of the nation.As for Mr Gove’s claims that this package underscores Westminster’s “absolute commitment” to Northern Ireland those who heard him and other members of the government loudly and repeatedly deny that an Irish Sea border would ever be accepted will understandably treat the comments with contempt.Yesterday’s announcement is bad news for everyone in Northern Ireland. Regardless of your stance on the constitutional question, the erection of a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain means you will be hit in the pocket in the months and years ahead.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It makes no economic sense. Far from yesterday’s announcement displaying a commitment to Northern Ireland it underscores a historic betrayal of this part of the United Kingdom.The fact that the DUP DAERA minister, despite his previous affirmations to the contrary, is now overseeing the imposition of the Irish Sea Border infrastructure at our ports, adds to the sense of betrayal that I as a unionist feel.The evaporation of opposition to the Betrayal Act by those in a position to take a stand, through the governmental positions they hold, is a great disappointment and disservice to future generations.Just last week we saw north southery turbocharged while the wedge of an Irish Sea border Is driven through the east west links. Arlene Foster declared her sanguinity to the Dublin government’s ‘shared island unit’ while the Republic’s Prime Minister made clear today its purpose is to anticipate a break-up of the UK. History, from a unionist perspective, will not judge kindly those at both a national and local level who facilitated and whitewashed the catastrophic consequences of the Betrayal Act.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles.

and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the
