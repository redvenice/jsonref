Compare the best rates across providers and save on costsWith the US economy performing relatively well and the Fed raising rates, the dollar has strengthened. It says only the Swiss franc and Swedish krona look overvalued against the dollar, at 19 per cent and six per cent respectively.The Norwegian krone now looks undervalued by five per cent, having looked overvalued by 18 per cent in January.However, this was due to McDonald\u0027s cutting the price of Big Macs by 14 per cent there rather than the dollar\u0027s strength against the krone, the index says.

With the US economy running hot, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and protectionist trade policies, this is a concern at the moment.Check our independent best-buy savings tables "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/16/4E4FCCD600000578-5959123-Nom_nom_nom_The_25_year_old_rapper_had_her_hair_tied_up_in_a_sca-a-21_1531753897603.jpg","title":"Cardi B spotted Atlanta hair salon hours gave birth baby Kulture","story":"Go for a logo with a Balenciaga bag like Cardi BShop it hereForget wearing your heart on your sleeve... this season it\u0026#39s all about rocking your favourite logo!From T-shirts, to accessories, to bags, going loud and proud with your designer of choice is the look du jour.Cardi B is the latest celeb to try the trend, spotted at the hair salon with a designer tote bag by cult fashion-pack favourite brand Balenicaga.If you\u0026#39re in the market for a new designer bag, then the perk of this one is the fact no-one will be left wondering if it\u0026#39s the real deal or not!

Just for the east side of the country. The south and central areas are likely to continue with the higher 20s.’Next week will welcome showers and possible thunderstorms for those in the south of England.When will the UK heatwave end?Although the UK will have a long period of sunny weather until August, bookies have predicted that the heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters the record books as the wettest ever.Forecaster Amy Hodgson of The Weather Channel said: ‘Increased cloud with outbreaks of light rain will affect Ireland and Scotland over the weekend, whilst England and Wales will be dry and mostly sunny.‘It will be a hot and humid weekend in a south-westerly flow, with maximum temperatures in the mid to high 20s across England and Wales, but cooler across Ireland and Scotland with highs in the high teens to low 20s.’          The heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters record books as the wettest everAlongside this, according to a Met Office forecaster, the weather will be ‘less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm. There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery.‘All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times.‘There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts. These bands of rain could occur at any time but become more likely later on in the period.The best of the fine weather and sunny conditions looks to be in the east and southeast of the UK. Temperatures will be close to average in the northwest, but with light winds it will still feel very warm at times across the south and east.’UK heatwave historyDuring the UK heatwave 2018, many parallels have been made with the hot weather that consumed the country during the summer of 1976. As reported in The Mirror, Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: ‘Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976.’However, the driest summer on record was in 1995, with only 64.7 ml of rain in June, July and August. The average for June this year was 35.4ml, which makes it one of the five warmest Junes in the UK since 1910.June 2018 was also one of the hottest for more than 300 years, bordering on the top 10 since records began 359 years ago.Take That tour: All you need to know about the 30th anniversary Greatest Hits tourGoogle and the United Nations Environment Programme to partner to monitor environmental changesWorld Emoji Day 2018: Everything you need to knowFortnite server crash sees players flood to PornhubEllen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Ellen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Bachelorette spoilers: Will Becca Kufrin \u0027pull an Arie\u0027 and break up with the winner?Miss Universe Great Britain\u0027s Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers revealed after becoming first black woman to hold the title Donald Trump is the first result if you Google Image search \u0027idiot\u0027 Who will win Love Island 2018?

Bolt (pictured) retired from athletics last year after he cemented his success as the fastest man in the world with eight Olympic gold medals and eleven world titlesIt is understood that Phelan, who worked closely with Sir Alex Ferguson for over 19 years, would be closely involved in Bolt\u0027s trial and potential season. Bolt retired from sprinting last year after he cemented himself as the fastest man on the world with eleven world titles.The eight-time Olympic gold medalist had grown up playing football and cricket before focusing on his athletic career.This would not be the first time Bolt has aimed for a professional career as he has already trialled at Borussia Dortmund in March and Stromsgodset last month.The German and Norwegian teams, respectively, did not offer Bolt a contract for the trials.  \u0027I want to try to get better, to work as hard as I can, play as much as I can.

If he can, let\u0027s light up the A-League and bring one of the biggest named athletes in sport to the Central Coast,\u0027 he said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/19/4E50918000000578-0-image-m-63_1531764786087.jpg","title":"Officials In policy shift US open meeting Taliban","story":"America is open to the possibility of direct talks with the Taliban in order to restart the stalled peace process in Afghanistan, officials say (a soldier patrols in Kabul, file image) In order to get the ball rolling again, American officials now say they would be willing to speak one-on-one with the Taliban.However, the goal of those talks would still be to get Taliban officials speaking with the Afghan government.  Afghan-to-Afghan negotiation remains the goal of any engagement with the militants, American officials said.The Taliban have refused to speak with the government despite Afghan President Ashraf Ghani declaring a unilateral ceasefire last month to mark the end of Ramadan.Britain refuses US request to extradite American \u0027terrorist\u0027...Share this articleMilitants had agreed to a three-day ceasefire and ignored calls by Ghani to extend it into a 10-day peace deal.Taliban attacks on government targets resumed on June 17 and while the Afghan government held out until the end of the month, Ghani gave the military permission to resume attacks at the start of July.  The unprecedented cease-fire had offered a rare glimpse of peace for Afghans during which militants fraternized with security force members.A Taliban official in the small Gulf Arab nation of Qatar told The Associated Press on Monday that no American official or intermediary has been in touch with them to start direct talks, and it had only heard of it in the media.           The Taliban has previously refused to negotiate with the government of Ashraf Ghani (pictured) and has instead demanded direct negotiations with WashingtonThe administration\u0027s willingness to hold direct talks with the Taliban was first reported by The New York Times on Sunday.The Taliban official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was authorized to speak to journalists, said, \u0027We wait for them to officially inform us.\u0027 But he added that if the U.S. is interested in talks, it should take steps to get Taliban leaders off a sanctions blacklist and support the formal opening of the Taliban office in Qatar where its political representatives reside. The official reiterated the Taliban\u0027s call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.Asked if the U.S. was willing to hold direct talks with the Taliban, the State Department said Monday, the United States \u0027is exploring all avenues to advance a peace process in close consultation with the Afghan government.\u0027The department added that \u0027any negotiations over the political future of Afghanistan will be between the Taliban and Afghan government.\u0027Last August, President Donald Trump launched an Afghanistan strategy that centered on boosting the capabilities of Afghan security forces and aiming - with help from Pakistan and other nations - to compel the militants to negotiate.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Afghanistan last week to reinforce its support for talks.\u0027The United States will support, facilitate, and participate in these peace discussions, but peace must be decided by the Afghans and settled among them. \u0027We expect that these peace talks will include a discussion of the role of international actors and forces,\u0027 Pompeo said after meeting Ghani in Kabul on July 9.The U.S. invaded Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and ousted the Taliban government that had hosted al-Qaida. It has about 15,000 troops in Afghanistan, mostly for training government forces.The conflict appears stalemated, with insurgents controlling or contesting more than 40 percent of the country. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Sunday that 1,692 civilians were killed in violence in the first six months of this year, the highest six-month death toll since the systematic documentation of civilian casualties started in 2009."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/10/4E4EA4E500000578-0-image-m-26_1531734011121.jpg","title":"Dr Bumbum goes runrun","story":"Lilian Calixto (right) travelled to Rio de Janeiro to undergo the procedure at the home of renowned surgeon to the stars Dr Denis Furtado (left)Married mother-of-two Ms Calixto, from Cuiaba, central Brazil, reportedly arrived at Furtado\u0027s apartment in the upmarket Barra da Tijuca district of Rio on Saturday night.It is believed she had booked to have PMMA acrylic fillers injected to increase the size of her buttocks, as well as a hormone implant to treat symptoms of the menopause.\u0027I\u0027m going to die.

She managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.The alleged incident was one of several unwanted advances made towards the woman by Ihsan between January and April last year after he rented the property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.The GP was subsequently asked to leave by the managers at the apartment block after the woman complained.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the housekeeper had been employed to clean various flats at the complex where Ihsan had taken out a lease on a serviced property.Lawyers for the General Medical Council Helena Duong told the Manchester hearing: \u0027She was responsible for cleaning his room and on a number of occasions, he was present when she was cleaning the room.\u0027On one incident in her statement she went to the room to collect her keys which she had left behind and Dr Ihsan opened the door with a towel around his waist.          Dr Mohammed Ihsan, 36, approached the woman whilst he was dressed only in a towel around his waist and told her: \u0027I\u0027m looking for some fun,\u0027 it is alleged\u0027After she retrieved her keys, he dropped his towel and exposed his bottom in her sight.

She subsequently told her manager who then rang police on her behalf. Another manager later got in contact with Ihsan and suggested he move out.In a statement Ms A said: \u0027I didn\u0027t want to tell my partner because I know he would go mad and would not let me go back into work.\u0027When asked how she did eventually tell him she replied: \u0027Yes I said to him how I got a bit upset at work and asked whether he remembered me telling him about that doctor. I said there was a bit of an incident again where he put his hands down the back of my trousers.\u0027Recalling one incident she said: \u0027I was situated with my back to the wardrobe. He bent over to open the wardrobe and his bottom touched mine. He did not say sorry for his bottom touching mine.\u0027Describing another she said: \u0027He came out and stood behind me and he was very close. I went a bit further up the door. He came up to me and locked the door so I pushed myself further up the door.\u0027She agreed with Miss Duong when she put it to Ms A: \u0027You say that the towel drops and Dr Ihsan exposes himself and then you say that he makes some other comments to you and then you say that you pushed him away against his bare chest.\u0027You then tell us about your phone ringing. You told him it was your boss calling.

But the soldiers mutinied and the little-loved Tsar abdicated in March.His departure brought the curtain down on the Romanov dynasty that had ruled Russia for 300 years.A fragile provisional government took over but was quickly overthrown by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\u0027s Marxist Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union was created. Nicholas sought asylum, including in Britain where King George V was his first cousin, but was rejected.           An image from the album shows how the Romanovs helped the wounded during the First World War, with medical vehicles bringing casualties in for treatment in 1915           Medical vehicles are lined up as they bring in soldiers wounded during the First World War in 1915 in another fascinating image from the newly released album          One of the images from 1918 shows the inside of Ipatiev house where the family was killed. In the early hours of July 17, 1918, Bolshevik police ordered the prisoners to the cellar of the house where they were being held.

Yurovski repeated his statement and, without hesitation, shouted: \u0027Fire!\u0027,\u0027 historian Robert Service recounts in \u0027The Last of the Tsars\u0027 (2017).Nicholas, his German-born wife Alexandra, their five children - aged from their early teens to early 20s - were killed, along with a maid, cook, valet and doctor. By some accounts it was a bloody and brutal scene.\u0027The first bullets did not bring death to the youngest ones and they were savagely killed with blows of bayonets and gun-butts and with shots at point-blank range,\u0027 says the Russian Orthodox Church, which regards the family as martyrs, on its website.The bodies were reportedly hastily buried in an unmarked grave on the outskirts of Yekaterinburg. The remains of Nicholas, his wife and three of their daughters - Anastasia, Olga and Tatiana - were tracked down by two amateur historians in 1979, although the discovery was only revealed in 1991, in the dying days of the Soviet Union.           Opulence: One of the images in the collection, from 1911, shows how a new palace was built in Livadia in Crimea that became the Romanovs’ summer residence.

A country-wide celebration was held for the entire year, which included religious ceremonies (pictured)          One of the key events in 1913 to mark the Tercentenary of the ruling Romanov Dynasty was a symbolic tour on the Volga river in May, when Nicholas II and his family followed the route of the first Romanov Tsar, Mikhail I, from Kostroma to Moscow          Hundreds of people lined the streets, including religious figures, for the many celebrations to mark the Tercentenary of the ruling Romanov Dynasty in 1913Exhumed and identified, they were buried in the imperial tomb in Saint Petersburg in July 1998 in a grandiose ceremony attended by president Boris Yeltsin.The execution was \u0027one of the most shameful pages in our history\u0027, the result of \u0027an irreconcilable ide in Russian society,\u0027 Yeltsin said.Amid popular legend that one of the children may have survived, several pretenders claimed later to be Anastasia, some seeking access to the royal fortune. They were always dismissed by the authorities.Bone fragments were found in 2007 that investigators and geneticists have said are from the two remaining children, heir Alexei and his sister Maria.But the powerful Orthodox Church doubts their identity and the remains lie in boxes in state archives, attempts to rebury them stalled. The Church in 2000 accorded the entire family the status of martyrs because of their faith.            The Romanovs made a visit the Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1909.

It nonetheless apportioned him some blame for approving the killings and not punishing the executors.There is \u0027no reliable document proving the instigation of Lenin\u0027 or his regional chief Yakov Sverdlov, a top investigator said in an AFP story at the time.However, \u0027when they heard that the whole family had been shot, they officially approved the shooting,\u0027 the investigator said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/19/4E35441800000578-5951733-image-a-54_1531507612445.jpg","title":"Reexamined Dare Stone solve mystery Lost Colony Roanoke","story":"The mystery of what happened to the Lost Colony of Roanoke has remained unsolved for the last 428 years, though a reexamination of a stone that was found in 1937 could be the key to explaining what happened to the 115 men, women and children. The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed. Pictured: Flour is applied to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text          \u0027Where do you put rocks?\u0027 Morrison says. \u0027We weren\u0027t crowing about them.

She managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.The alleged incident was one of several unwanted advances made towards the woman by Ihsan between January and April last year after he rented the property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.The GP was subsequently asked to leave by the managers at the apartment block after the woman complained.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the housekeeper had been employed to clean various flats at the complex where Ihsan had taken out a lease on a serviced property.Lawyers for the General Medical Council Helena Duong told the Manchester hearing: \u0027She was responsible for cleaning his room and on a number of occasions, he was present when she was cleaning the room.\u0027On one incident in her statement she went to the room to collect her keys which she had left behind and Dr Ihsan opened the door with a towel around his waist.

He bent over to open the wardrobe and his bottom touched mine. He did not say sorry for his bottom touching mine.\u0027Describing another she said: \u0027He came out and stood behind me and he was very close. I went a bit further up the door. He came up to me and locked the door so I pushed myself further up the door.\u0027She agreed with Miss Duong when she put it to Ms A: \u0027You say that the towel drops and Dr Ihsan exposes himself and then you say that he makes some other comments to you and then you say that you pushed him away against his bare chest.\u0027You then tell us about your phone ringing. You told him it was your boss calling. He replied that there were not any cameras in the room but you said that your boss would know that you were in there and you quickly unlocked the front door.\u0027In November last year Ihsan was suspended for nine months after being found guilty of misconduct.He quizzed a patient about her sex life during a routine appointment, and he told a second patient he was \u0027horny\u0027 and asked to see her bottom at his surgery in South Kirby, Wakefield.  At the time Dr Ihsan said he acknowledged the seriousness of his actions and was sorry for what had happened. Ihsan, from Huddersfield, denies sexually motivated misconduct.

The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed.

We weren\u0027t showing them off or anything, but I don\u0027t think they were actually hiding them. I think they were just done with them. There was no champion for them around anymore and they just sort of languished around, no further advancement on them at all.\u0027 Schrader is pictured examining the original Dare Stone          In 2016, Brenau brought the Dare Stone to the geology department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where they have the equipment needed to cut a small part of the stone and do mineral and chemical analyses, which was also featured on a History Channel program in March 2017          The Dare Stone sits near a saw before a sample is taken during the filming of the 2017 History Channel program at the University of North Carolina Asheville          During the 2016 analysis, they found that the stone is almost completely pure white vein quartz with amounts of gold, selenium and copper, which helped narrow down the possible location of the stone to an area in southern Virginia, about 60 miles upriver from the approximate location of where the stone was found in 1937          Their next step, Morrison says, is to determine how thick the layer of patina, or film produced from oxidation, is around the stone, to pinpoint when the carving actually happened. They are also trying to put together a comprehensive team to thoroughly study the stone      ¿Dare Stone¿ Highlighted in Second Two-hour History Channel Program - Brenau University"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/11/4E45796100000578-0-image-m-40_1531651515865.jpg","title":"New Mexican statue Virgin Mary WEEPING spewing tears OLIVE OIL","story":"    A sample of fluid was taken from the statue, located at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Hobbs, and sent for a chemical analysis          The church is investigating to determine whether the oil coming from the hallow statue happened because of natural causes\u0027Some of the witnesses claimed it smelled of roses, so something similar to the oil I bless and consecrate each year that we use for baptism, for confirmations and for ordination of the priests.\u0027The church is investigating to determine whether the oil coming from the hollow statue is being secreted naturally.Church leaders also looked into the possibility that something from the inside of the statue was causing the leak. \u0027We examined the interior of the hollow statue,\u0027 Cantú added. \u0027There\u0027s nothing on the interior that\u0027s not supposed to be there, except for cobwebs.

This retrospective perfectly captures his unhurried pursuit of a now vanished Manhattan‘I simply looked at the world, not prepared for anything,” Saul Leiter said towards the end of his life. That sense of unhurriedness, coupled with a painterly eye for colour and composition, is palpable in his evocative colour photographs of New York. There is also an attentiveness that speaks of his disinterest in anything other than making the seemingly mundane world around him seem luminously beautiful.By the time he was “discovered” in 2006 with the publication of a book, Early Colour, he was 82. He had been working quietly for almost 60 years, first in monochrome, as a photojournalist, then in the 1950s, turning to colour to capture the rhythm and stillness of the same few streets around his Manhattan apartment in the soft, deep tones of Kodachrome slide film.Leiter’s late recognition brought him the kind of attention he had long avoided. In Tomas Leach’s thoughtful documentary, In No Great Hurry: 13 Life Lessons With Saul Leiter, he emerges as a reluctant object of attention. “What makes them think I’m any good?” he asks. In a sublime retrospective at the Foto Colectania gallery in Barcelona, there are 130 answers to that question, almost every one a testament to his singular talent. In Search of Beauty, which is currently drawing hushed and reverent crowds to the newly relocated gallery in Passeig Picasso, is a well-nigh perfect overview of Leiter’s career. In many ways, it is the perfect space for his deeply crafted images: the gallery is in a converted saddler’s that retains an artisanal atmosphere, with its wood-panelled offices and library enclosing a simple square space.Curator Roger Szmulewicz has wisely chosen to lead with Leiter’s signature colour photographs of Manhattan. Arranged in a single line around the perimeter, each one is a study in form, colour and atmosphere. This is not the overcrowded, fast-paced New York later caught by the likes of Garry Winogrand or Joel Meyerowitz. Instead, what Leiter captures, and heightens, is the atmosphere of another, older Manhattan – an almost sedate place, sometimes suffused with warm summer light, sometimes blanketed by falling snow.Often he shoots through steamed windows or catches a passing reflection. His subjects are stilled in a moment of reverie, waiting at traffic lights or daydreaming in a stalled vehicle. Sometimes he shot at night or at twilight, just as the light was fading, so that people appear as ghostly silhouettes against the deep reds and greens of advertising billboards and neon shop signs. He isolates lone human figures in stark relief against snow or rain. Umbrellas are a recurring motif, their circular geometry irresistibly drawing the eye, like a splash of red or orange in an impressionist painting. He was constantly alert, too, to the typographical poetry of street signs and lettering stencilled on shop windows. It all adds up to an intimate portrait of a time, a place and its passing people.The son of an Orthodox rabbi who fled the constrictions of a traditional Jewish upbringing in Pittsburgh to try to become an artist in mid-1940s New York, Leiter never lost his painter’s eye for colour and composition. Some of his images approach the purely abstract: shadows against blurred orange lights a dark silhouette just identifiable against a blur of passing cars people and things partially obscured by shadowy objects in the foreground. The result is a strange hybrid of intimate observation and heightened atmosphere, the creation of a New York that is familiar and slightly unreal in the way that certain paintings of the city are unreal – Edward Hopper’s work springs to mind. Leiter was a photographer possessed of a painter’s sensibility. He even made a series of painted nudes, applying paint on top of his photographic portraits to often vibrant effect.It is hardly surprising then, that in the earlier black and white work, New York seems like another city – more ghostly and gritty, less dreamlike. Here, too, Leiter plays with form, homing in on silhouettes, catching shafts of geometric light as they fall on faces and torsos. To some degree, that painter’s eye informs every photograph. Even more revelatory are the series of recently discovered intimate portraits, many of them collected in the new Steidl photo book, In My Room. In the 1950s and into the early 60s, Leiter photographed the women he knew – including his longtime partner-muse, Soames Bantry, and several of her model friends – mostly in his New York studio.The portraits, in grainy black and white, are certainly erotic, but in an almost languorous way. He captures his subjects in motion or in repose, sometimes seemingly unaware of his gaze, sometimes returning it with a provocative or accepting look. The few full nudes are the most abstract images, shadows falling on skin, the prints grainy and high contrast. Again, many of the images were taken through doors or screens, giving the sense of glimpsed intimate snapshots – except his compositional skill is so consistently finely honed as to make the term seem almost insulting. There is a relaxed intimacy to them that speaks of thoughtful collaboration between photographer and subject.After such richness, the single wall of Leiter’s colour fashion photography seems almost superfluous. One can see he was too singular an artist to be at ease in such a commercial sphere, yet he succeeds in making portraits that, as he put it later, looked “like a photograph rather than a fashion photograph”. More interesting still is the small collection of ephemera, in the wood-panelled library next door, that includes family snapshots, a sketchbook and palette knives.Half a dozen quotes by Leiter are stencilled on the walls of the gallery. One reads: “There is a tremendous advantage of being unimportant.” Another reads: “In some secret place in my being was a desire to avoid success.” Both give you some idea of Leiter’s temperament and the ways it informed the unhurried pursuit of his art. The almost devotional hush in the gallery as people peer at these images is testimony to a life devoted to the quiet pursuit of a singular vision and the avoidance of such distractions as fame or even recognition. For Leiter, simply looking at the world was enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0fcef8f0945eab73876efd84d3a17c905779ea/0_128_5074_3044/master/5074.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43ee1b2f9deb027446c5011fe63b10c","title":"genetically modifying future children embryos nuffield council bioethics","story":"The Nuffield Council on Bioethics has taken what it clearly regards as a brave new step: it has openly endorsed the use of genome editing to engineer the traits of future children and generations. The council’s report, Genome editing and human reproduction: social and ethical issues, asserts that such a move could be “morally permissible” under certain circumstances. In effect, it argues that the creation of genetically modified human beings should proceed after a few bioethics-lite boxes are checked off.The report’s conclusion flies in the face of a widespread global agreement that heritable genetic modification should remain off-limits, a commitment reflected in the laws of many nations, a binding European treaty, several international declarations, and numerous public opinion surveys.Unfortunately, a number of scientists and bioethicists, especially in the United States, have recently reached conclusions similar to the Nuffield council’s. But their reasoning has been quite different. Until now, proponents of heritable genetic modification have typically argued that if it is shown to be safe, it should be allowed only as a medical matter, only to prevent the births of children with serious genetic diseases, only if no alternatives are available, and certainly not for enhancement or cosmetic purposes.The council’s report has now dispensed with those fig leaves. Its clarity about why it supports heritable genetic modification, and what’s at stake, may be its most important – though unintended – contribution to the controversy.The report recognises that heritable genetic modification cannot be understood as medicine: there is no sick person in need of treatment or cure. It doesn’t try to justify heritable genetic modification as a way of preventing the transmission of serious genetic disease, it acknowledges that this can be accomplished with existing reproductive procedures such as the embryo screening technique known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.These points are usually raised as part of the case that existing prohibitions on heritable genetic modification should be maintained and strengthened. After all, if the medical justification is tenuous at best, and if the technology isn’t needed to allow carriers of seriously deleterious genetic variants to have genetically related and unaffected children, why would anyone consider an irreversible experiment in manipulating embryonic genes?Then there is the societal perspective typically emphasised by opponents of heritable genetic modification: the deep concern that trying to define and enforce limits wouldn’t work that the line between “therapy” and “enhancement” is too blurry and subjective to enact as policy that we would soon find ourselves in a world in which parents pursued projects to improve their children at the one-cell stage. The Nuffield report admits that the classic distinction between “therapeutic” and “enhancement” uses of heritable genetic modification cannot be expected to hold, and it foresees that the technology could be harnessed to create “supersenses or superabilities” for genetically engineered offspring, and to satisfy parents’ “preferences” for children with “certain characteristics”.Again, it seems strange for supporters of heritable genetic modification to raise the prospect of a world in which the affluent purchase genetic upgrades for their children, and to acknowledge that if widely adopted, this powerful technology could “produce or exacerbate social ision, or marginalise or disadvantage groups in society”. In fact, avoiding that eventuality is one of two principles offered as a guide to the ethical use of heritable genome editing interventions.This makes it all the more striking that the report, several years in the making and almost 200 pages long, barely considers the social, commercial and competitive dynamics that would powerfully promote such an outcome, or how they could be mitigated. Though it substantively addresses discrimination against people with disabilities, it has almost nothing to say about vulnerabilities to injustice due to racism, sexism, socioeconomic status and other forms of inequality. Instead, it pleads that it is “beyond the scope of this report to reflect the range of futures that contain the various possible genomic technologies (or none)”.The bottom line is all too clear. Sadly, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics has given its blessing to an unneeded and societally dangerous biotechnology, one that could be leveraged by privileged elites seeking purported genetic improvements to ensure that their children are treated as superior to the rest of us. Haven’t we been down the path of biologically defined hierarchies before? In a world plagued with obscene inequalities, in a time of resurgent racism, is this the road we want to travel?There is still time to turn back. We can refuse to allow inequalities to be inscribed in our genomes. We can forgo a future in which class isions harden into genetic castes. We can instead affirm the widespread rejection of heritable genetic modification, and reclaim biotechnology as an instrument for fostering solidarity and serving the common good.• Marcy Darnovsky is executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society and co-editor, with Osagie K Obasogie, of Beyond Bioethics: Toward a New Biopolitics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da233e9012e20fe143ebe53bb1d95c1efa7330b/0_122_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bb7886c661e6393865bc8f1f12c672","title":"kylie jenner myth early success","story":"While the 20-year-old may soon be worth $1bn thanks to her cosmetics empire, the fetishisation of youthful entrepreneurs masks the lack of opportunity for most millennialsAs the world edges ever closer to apocalypse, it is important to take time out from the unrelenting hellscape that is the news to celebrate the occasional feelgood story. So, please have your handkerchiefs at the ready for the moving tale of a young woman who, against all odds, stared down adversity and achieved the sort of success of which a mere mortal could only dream.I speak of Kylie Jenner. Forbes estimated last week that the 20-year-old, who parlayed her reality TV show fame into a lucrative cosmetics empire, is worth $900m (£680m) and is on track to unseat Mark Zuckerberg as the “youngest self-made billionaire” in history.The Forbes article prompted a debate, mostly among losers lazy enough not to have been born into a megarich family, about what “self-made” means. We don’t need to rehash that debate, because we all have access to a dictionary. It is obvious that anyone with the wherewithal to plaster their famous name on lip kits, instead of frivolously squandering their familial fortune, is “self-made”. But enough snark about semantics. I want to talk about the cult of early success that has framed the conversation around Jenner’s fortune. Thanks to the pace of technological change, experience is no longer equated with age and a cultural expectation seems to have been set that bright young things should succeed from the get-go. As Forbes put it in the introduction to its 2014 30 Under 30 list: “Never before has youth been such an advantage. These founders and funders … aren’t waiting for a proper bump up the career ladder. Their goals are way bigger – and perfectly suited to the dynamic, entrepreneurial and impatient digital world they grew up in.”While it is great that our impatient digital world has lowered the age barrier to success, it has also perpetuated unreasonable expectations. Increasingly, if you have not “made it” by 30, you are seen as being over the hill. Forget getting funding for your startup idea, for example. “The cutoff in investors’ heads is 32,” said Paul Graham, a prominent venture capitalist,in a 2013 New York Times interview. “After 32, they start to be a little sceptical.” Which is only reasonable. As a fresh-faced Zuckerberg told an audience at a 2007 tech event, “young people are just smarter”.The problem with the myth of the entrepreneurial wunderkind is that it is, well, a myth. Experience and time (plus inherited wealth and luck) are still important factors in success. Earlier this year, researchers from MIT, Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and the US Census Bureau analysed data from companies started between 2007 and 2015. They found that the average age of people who founded the best-performing startups was 45. “If you had two identical ideas, one proposed by a very young person, one proposed by a middle-aged person, and that’s the only thing you have to go on, you would be better off – if you wanted to predict success – betting on a middle-aged person,” one of the lead researchers said.Another problem with fetishising early success is that amplifying super-successful young outliers helps gloss over the inconvenient fact that most millennials are far worse off than the generation before them. Insecure jobs, low wages and unaffordable housing mean it is increasingly difficult for your hard work to pay off, no matter how enterprising you are. Unless, of course, you are Kylie Jenner.WeWork, one of the world’s most valuable startups, has given meat the chop. Last week, the office-space provider informed its 6,000 employees that they will no longer be able to expense meals that include poultry, pork or red meat. There also won’t be any meat at staff events paid for by the company.The company’s co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, explained in an email to employees that this decision was being made for the greater good. “New research indicates that avoiding meat is one of the biggest things an inidual can do to reduce their personal environmental impact.” WeWork claims the policy will save 16.7bn gallons of water and 15.5m animals by 2023.WeWork is not the first company to try to enforce a meat-free environment. The founder of Juicero, the startup that went bust last year after its $699 wifi juice machine failed to catch on, allegedly chastised employees who had milk in their coffee (which he referred to as “cow pus”). Former employees have said that sometimes he did not allow them to expense work meals at non-vegan restaurants.Not everyone agrees with WeWork’s decision. The TUC criticised the new policy, saying that, while employees should be encouraged to make healthy choices, “they should not be left out of pocket if they choose to eat meat”. I think this is right. Nevertheless, large employers should be doing more to reduce meat consumption. Companies would do well to commit to increasing the number of vegetarian options at their events and in their cafeterias and reducing the amount of meat on the menu. Environmentally speaking, this would do a lot more good than our current obsession with banning straws.Let it be said that I never pass up a good opportunity for procrastination – even if needles are involved. Last week, the co-working space from which I occasionally work was, for some reason, offering vitamin B12 injections. I immediately signed myself up. I have, you see, the trifecta of characteristics that mark out B12-deficient people: I am lazy, a vegetarian and a hypochondriac. I reckoned a $30 injection would be an easier way of getting a burst of energy than tedious things such as diet and exercise. Reader, I was wrong. All I got from being stabbed in the arm with a needle was a small puncture wound."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baae4148a9a3dd4bb0d55dfd1209dcf4a8e51e58/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77baa878fe62b24d9e1d9245fe8d8e83","title":"ministers vote leave sacked electoral commission brexit undemocratic","story":"Those who persuaded the British people to vote for Brexit have now given up on a glorious future for global Britain. These arguments lie in tatters, buried beneath the government’s own studies into the impacts of Brexit showing it will be disastrous for the economy under any scenario. Instead, they are resorting to the “will of the people” mantra. Take Priti Patel’s recent tweet in which she says: “This is no longer an argument about whether Brexit was a good idea but is about democracy \u0026amp standing by the democratic decision made by the people.” In other words, no matter how bad the consequences for all of us, we have to go ahead with Brexit because democracy demands it.But upholding democracy is a selective affair for Brexiteers. The leave campaign has wasted no time in engaging in some mudslinging at the Electoral Commission, the body responsible for regulating our democracy. The commission’s investigation into Vote Leave found the campaign group broke the law by coordinating with sister campaign, BeLeave. Vote Leave has been fined £61,000 and both campaigns have been referred to the police. Yet the response from Vote Leave officials is to accuse the Electoral Commission of “false accusations” and being motivated by a political agenda, “unfounded claims and conspiracy theories”. It is worth reminding ourselves at this point that a host of senior government ministers sat on the Vote Leave campaign committee. These included Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Steve Baker and Chris Grayling, as well as the defender of democracy herself, Priti Patel.It is also worth noting the strong overlap between Vote Leave members and the odious European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, that is currently holding Theresa May hostage over her Brexit plans. In spite of the shocking weakness of our constitution that Brexit has exposed, we need the prime minister to demonstrate her stalwart defence of the rule of law by sacking cabinet ministers who were on the Vote Leave committee, namely Fox, Gove, Grayling and Raab. She should also recall that we are signatories to the Venice commission which states that campaign overspending is adequate grounds for annulling an election result. The foundations of our democratic systems are being undermined and it is May’s duty to defend them.Of course, today’s news of Vote Leave breaching electoral law is just the latest in a series of scandals to dog the leave campaigns. Leave.EU, the campaign supported by Nigel Farage and funded by Arron Banks, has also been found to have breached electoral law and fined. Its chief executive has been referred to the police. And then of course there is the whole question of micro-targeting and psychological manipulation techniques and the scandals around AIQ and Cambridge Analytica and the ways in which they were linked to the leave campaigns. The democratic mandate for Brexit has been undermined.Even if this mandate were strong and stable there would still be reason to question whether we press ahead with Brexit when so much has changed both within our country and across the world. Not least, a US president who is so easily manipulated at the hands of authoritarian tyrants. His failure to denounce Russian meddling in the US presidential election sets him against American law enforcers, defence officials and intelligence agencies, all of whom believe that Russia did interfere in the 2016 presidential elections. There is also the fact that Brexit serves Trump’s agenda of destabilising both UK and US democracies and Putin’s agenda of undermining the EU, which is why there are substantiated claims of Russian interference in the referendum campaign.So there are good grounds for considering the vote to leave the EU now lacks legitimacy. It is quite clear that the mandate for Brexit lies buried beneath countless occurrences of cheating, voter manipulation and electoral law-breaking.It is rare I would quote David Davis on anything, but on democracy he is spot on: “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.” This helps explain the growing chorus from all shades of the political spectrum for a people’s vote. The idea is also proving increasingly popular with the public.The Brexiteers are using arguments about democracy to try and force through something that will have profoundly negative impacts on the UK economy, society and the environment for generations to come. True democracy acknowledges that we make mistakes and provides opportunities to think again. Not only does this enhance rather than diminish our democracy, it may be necessary to save it.• Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for the South West of England and Green party speaker on Brexit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4389e52ecfff03c5cb17fc3d48cf223a88c34c42/0_219_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48a98fba36987a3b203b54d562d8c57b","title":"the guardian view on childrens books a restricted view of a wide world","story":"The report welcomes the promise of publishers, from established mainstream names to new independents to do better in addressing all forms of\u0026nbspersity.

We have cut leakage by half since the 1990s and are working hard to do even more,” a spokesperson said. The company met its leakage targets for 2016-17.The government was recently told by its infrastructure advisers to set a target for firms to halve leakage by 2050. The National Infrastructure Commission pointed out that reductions had largely stalled over the past decade and households needed to be encouraged to conserve more.The average use per person nationally is 141 litres per day, down from 150 litres in 2000, but still well behind Europe’s best-performers, the Belgians and the Danes, who use about 115 litres per day.One of United Utilities’ customers, the fracking firm Cuadrilla, has said residents would not be left short at its Lancashire operations, at a site between Blackpool and Preston. The water industry has warned shale firms they could face a shortage of water supplies in some areas.Cuadrilla said that fracking the two wells at Preston New Road, which is now expected to take place in late August or early September, would use up to 32,500 litres of water.A company spokesperson said: “It is highly unlikely that our operations would be affected by a water shortage, however estimates of predicted water demands have been supplied to United Utilities to allow them to assess their existing systems and any impacts on their wider network.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0956fa5bc28b5b01ca75bf3c1dab5179936d299/395_231_2756_1653/master/2756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646f9beb62cae21743bd1e71c878f4e1","title":"swan upping on the thames counting the queens birds in pictures","story":"This week marks the annual stocktake of the crown’s swans on the River Thames, known as swan upping.

Her 90th birthday speech is broadcast on Beyoncé’s Lemonade (you’ll know the bit even if you haven’t ever listened to the album). “I was served lemons,” she says, “but I made lemonade.”Two years on from those immortal words #whenlifegivesyoulemons has been used more than 160,000 times on Instagram, and spawned a thousand memes. The lemon emoji, meanwhile, has almost three million hashtags. Beyoncé was – as ever – early on the trend. Keen to make her album a 360 experience, fans could buy a baseball cap with a lemon on it for her 2017 tour, and it’s still available online. The lemon has since blossomed. Forget florals or palm fronds, fruits are the print to wear in 2018, and lemons are the pick of the bunch.You’ll find them on swimsuits at Matchesfashion and dresses at Asos. Lemon earrings are a thing at Accessorize, Jacquemus and boutique brands including Wolf \u0026amp Moon. They add zing to any outfit (they will also start conversations, so be warned – don’t wear if you are not keen for a chat at the bus stop). Lemons on T-shirts work, too – Ganni’s Murphy, which features a lemon, was an influencer favourite. It is sold out but you can find similar versions at Topshop and Missguided (FYI early adopters: Ganni has moved on to the banana). Celebrities have also taken to impersonating the fruit – the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex have worn shift dresses the colour of limoncello over the past week, a confident hit of serotonin for public engagements.If summer 2017 was tropical – pineapples and palms – this year has shifted. The alpha lemon to have printed on your dress – or artfully arranged on a bleached wood table on your social media post – is the Sorrento lemon, native to Italy. It hails from the Amalfi Coast, and comes unwaxed with organic-looking nobbles and bobbles and, ideally, a couple of leaves still attached (smooth GM-style fruits aren’t really reading the room).There’s a sort of timeless, universal appeal to the lemon print in the summer, one that feels instant, friendly and inclusive rather than in-the-know like, say, slogan or band T-shirts. They have been an everyday motif in art for centuries – in paintings from 17th-century Dutch still lives, to Picasso’s abstractions in the 1930s, Roy Lichtenstein’s pop lemons and even the 1989 Stone Roses album, a John Squire take on a Jackson Pollock.It makes sense, perhaps, that when it comes to designers, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana really own the lemon trend. They are geographically closest to the Amalfi Coast, after all. The Italian duo produced a collection based on the mercato ortofrutticolo – that’s Italian for farmer’s market, but you knew that – including tomatoes, courgette flowers and chillies in 2012. Lemons have emerged as a favourite though. A whole collection appeared in 2016. Last year, they released a jewellery campaign shot in a lemon orchard. As with most things with the Italian label, the vibes here are sex kitten off-duty – Sophia Loren cooking up spaghetti al limone, or Brigitte Bardot visiting Picasso at his studio in 1956.

Hedges received an Oscar nomination for his breakout performance in Manchester by the Sea and has since appeared in Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His onscreen parents in the film are played by Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman.Edgerton, most recently seen opposite Jennifer Lawrence in Red Sparrow, also appears in front of the camera as the head of the program.“I’m obsessed with cults and prisons, and I felt like I was going to get this glimpse into a world I’d heard about,” Edgerton said of the film earlier this year. “You leave Garrard’s story feeling like the true conversion that is at the heart of the movie is the conversion of his ideas.”It’s the second film this year to tackle the issue of gay conversion therapy, following on from Appropriate Behaviour director Desiree Akhavan’s comedy drama The Miseducation of Cameron Post, which won the Grand Jury prize at January’s Sundance film festival.Boy Erased is released in US cinemas on 2 November and is expected to premiere at the fall festival circuit, with an Oscar campaign expected to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67220c682c272c1baa8a1b448efc5a5eafdaf152/664_767_1803_1082/master/1803.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be23e1371b7f4fb96a550e17fb0461fe","title":"spectator retracts harvey weinstein confession interview","story":"Interviewer says he may have misrepresented conversation with movie producerThe Spectator has formally retracted quotes it attributed to Harvey Weinstein, in which the disgraced former film mogul allegedly admitted to offering acting jobs in exchange for sex, in addition to deleting an unrelated description of Weinstein attempting to hit on women at a Christmas party.The interview, by regular columnist and friend of Weinstein’s Taki Theodoracopulos, was live for several days after it was called into question after its publication on Friday. In the piece, the film producer responded to multiple accusations of sexual assault that could result in him being sent to prison.The piece ran with the headline: “Harvey Weinstein: ‘I offered acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so does everyone – they still do’” and the subheading: “The disgraced movie producer reached out to Taki with a ‘world exclusive’ about Rose McGowan and Asia Argento”, making reference to two of the film producer’s accusers. The magazine stated that Weinstein complained he had been born “poor, ugly, Jewish and had to fight all my life to get somewhere”. “You got lotsa girls, no girl looked at me until I made it big in Hollywood,” the original Spectator piece quoted him as telling Theodoracopulos. “Yes, I did offer them acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone. But I never, ever forced myself on a single woman.”The claims that Weinstein had admitted he exchanged employment for sex were widely reported around the world but were soon denied by the film producer’s personal lawyer, who claimed he was present for the interview.Theodoracopulos soon said he may have misinterpreted Weinstein but the piece initially remained unchanged over the weekend, prompting doubt over whether the magazine stood by the reporting. However, it has now been updated to carry the headline: “My chat with Harvey Weinstein”, the most controversial quotes have been deleted, and it carries an “update” from the author.“A section of this article, in which I may have misrepresented Harvey’s conversation with me in New York last month, has been removed,” said Theodoracopulos in the revised version. “It was my mistake. We were discussing Hollywood and I may have misunderstood certain things about the methods of that place. I hope I have not damaged his case.”Theodoracopulos did not only remove quotes from Weinstein but also deleted a supplementary paragraph discussing the film producer’s approach to women: “I’ve seen Harvey in action during my annual Christmas party, the one I throw every year in New York with Michael Mailer. He hits on every young woman but in a naive way. ‘Will you give me your address and I’ll make you a star,’ is the theme of the pickup. Some say yes, some say no. His reaction was always the same. Smile and laugh and hit on the next one.”It is unclear how Theodoracopulos misquoted Weinstein or why the separate commentary on the producer’s behaviour at Christmas parties was also deleted, since it was not relating to the recent interview with him.Tweets and URLs relating to the original version of the piece have since been deleted or redirected.Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, declined to comment on the retraction, citing the fact his magazine preferred to let its columnists speak for themselves and pointing out that the interview had been posted as a blog on the magazine’s US website. Theodoracopulos, 81, is the offspring of a Greek shipping tycoon and has written the Spectator’s “High Life” column for more than four decades, regularly attracting controversy for his extreme rightwing views. In May, one of his columns regarding the army of Nazi Germany was published under the headline: “In praise of the Wehrmacht”. It was swiftly changed to “The other side of D-Day”. He has also written in defence of the violent neo-fascist Greek party Golden Dawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841e361bc1b22733151b3dd0be5f8c2cbb46caac/1_0_5507_3306/master/5507.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f23ba47bc80b401a19c07a26a3f81e2a","title":"the world cup colour chart a photographic journey","story":"Looking back at the highs and lows of Russia 2018 via a rainbow of imagery, from Gareth Southgate to France lifting the trophy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb041c191609e9acbbdd0f726715168348d6948/1046_295_927_556/master/927.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=8249b604ff6481886645392e10c09e5d","title":"princess diana landmine legacy angola huambo","story":"21 years on, the Angolan province Diana visited is within months of being declared clear of unexploded ordnance.

By comparison, the entertainment group Disney – which s film, theme parks, broadcasters ESPN and ABC and is spending more than $70bn to try to buy 21st Century Fox to fight the Netflix threat – is valued at $164bn.Even after four consecutive quarters of subscriber growth that comfortably beat forecasts, a single quarter miss for a company that needs to remain in constant high-growth mode has investors worrying about whether the Netflix peak has arrived.“This was always going to cause jitters among investors from a company that’s spent so heavily on content in order to boost its subscriber numbers,” said Joshua Owen, a senior trader at Ayondo Markets. “The question for investors is whether this is a blip or something more structural within the video streaming landscape.”The Netflix juggernaut relies on maintaining rapid global growth to continue paying for the content that is its lifeblood – $8bn on 700 original TV shows and 80 movies this year alone. If the slowdown in subscribers persists, the company’s already pressurised business model could break.Netflix is on track to make $1bn in profits this year. But the company continues to spend much more than it makes and competition against rivals such as Amazon and Apple is intensifying, forcing budgets ever higher for the best content and talent to win new subscribers.Netflix expects a negative free cash flow of between $3bn to $4bn this year, meaning the amount its spends on content, marketing and other costs in 2018 will exceed what it earns from subscriber revenue ($16bn) by at least $3bn. In April, the company issued its fifth bond in three years to help finance its activities, adding $1.9bn in fresh debt. Its debt mountain has surged from $300m in March 2016 to $6.5bn. And it has committed to spending $17bn to making and licensing TV and film content over the next few years.The California-based business that started out as a DVD rental outfit two decades ago has in recent years been viewed as a digital startup, making it hot stock with investors, which has, for the most part, kept it insulated from negative market sentiment and scrutiny.“The question is whether Netflix is generating enough profit and cashflow to support its monster valuation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2914ff5095e988b4767a690147c42ba877d6a83/82_108_3918_3078/master/3918.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e0b03d91d16313f7c73bf6ceae86f0dc 1480w","title":"how can the brexit stalemate be broken","story":"From ‘keep buggering on’ to a second referendum, it may be the ticking clock of the article 50 deadline that decidesIt was obvious from the morning of 9 June 2017, when Theresa May woke up to find the electorate had stripped her of her majority, that crafting a Brexit that could win support in parliament as well as in Brussels would be a formidable challenge.Over the ensuing 12 months or so, the prime minister has been masterful in postponing the inevitable moment of reckoning within her party – but the row about how closely Britain should cleave to the EU after March 2019 is now being fought in Westminster.Since the Chequers agreement shifted the government’s position significantly in a soft Brexit direction, it has been the Eurosceptic hardliners who have been most angry.But after the government decided to accept a series of amendments tabled by the European Research Group (ERG), led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, on Monday, it was Tory remainers who were enraged, and acted on their anger by opposing the changes.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.It was tight, but the government won by a whisker on Monday night, allowing its customs bill to move to the House of Lords. But May looks increasingly boxed in by rebels on both sides of her riven party.So how can the deadlock be broken? The first and perhaps still the most probable possibility for May is the approach Winston Churchill called KBO (“keep buggering on”).Discussions in Brussels will continue over the summer, key leavers including Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom are still onside, and some analysts believe it will do no harm for May to have to abandon aspects of the Chequers deal that the EU27 would always be likely to reject – including the complex “facilitated customs arrangement”.According to Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, the ERG has “scuppered a plan that could never have worked: calm down everyone”.He describes the Chequers agreement as a “holding position”, adding: “They thought Brussels would kill it, which is difficult. Jacob Rees-Mogg has killed it instead.” Menon argues that there is no “third way” between customs union membership and a much looser relationship, as David Davis and Boris Johnson advocate.Paradoxically, May’s other weapon is the article 50 deadline of March next year. A good proportion of MPs in both the Conservatives – though not many of the ERG – and Labour are convinced that leaving the EU with no deal would be a disaster. So as time runs out, it will become less and less practical for MPs to try to send May back to the drawing board.The deadline also makes it less tempting for the hardliners to throw May overboard, by firing off 48 letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, and trigger a vote of no confidence in an attempt to replace her. Rather than blow the summer on a leadership contest, the ERG are expected to keep up the pressure for their preferred Canada-style trade deal, using every PR tactic available.“Key to all of this is the ticking clock caused by article 50,” says Philip Cowley, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “Without this she’s finished now. With it, she can play a game of chicken with the other parties and some of her MPs.”If May survives that long, the real moment of reckoning will come when she and her new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, come back to the Commons with whatever deal they have been able to strike in October, or as now seems increasingly likely, December.The longest-serving health secretary - having held the role for almost six years - becomes foreign secretary after Boris Johnson\u0027s resignation.The former culture secretary replaces Hunt as health secretary.The former attorney general takes on Hancock’s old job as culture secretary.The Devon MP is promoted to be attorney general and will attend cabinet.The former housing minister is promoted to Brexit secretary after the resignation of David Davis.Goes to the backbenches after kicking off the ministerial reshuffle with his resignation as Brexit secretary over Theresa May\u0027s negotiation plans.The gaffe-prone and controversial foreign secretary joins Davis on the backbenches after also quitting his role.It is still possible that enough Labour MPs are alarmed about a no-deal scenario, or wary of appearing to “block Brexit”, that they could offset the ERG sceptics and allow it to pass – though whether either party would hold together in that eventuality is a moot point.If parliament failed to back the deal, May would find herself in an unprecedented constitutional bind. As the former cabinet minister Justine Greening’s intervention this week illustrated, the prime minister will face mounting pressure to resolve the impasse by throwing the decision back to the public.A referendum would take time to trigger, probably necessitating an extension of article 50, which would require the approval of every one of the EU27. It may also be no less isive than the 2016 referendum that smashed up a decades-long political consensus.Another option – albeit a desperate one – to break the stalemate would be to call a general election. That is more difficult than it was before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, but as 2017 showed, by no means impossible. And Labour would jump at the chance.Cowley says: “Labour has a four- or five-point lead in some polls. That’s as nothing compared to what I think you’d see if we had a general election fought with the Conservative party in the state they’re in at the moment, because they would just fall in on themselves.”Rather than resolve the complex challenge of Brexit by delivering a decisive majority for one of the two main parties, though, a general election may just underline how polarised the country has become since the summer of 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f323d933739df449163102a018f22ee362ed8da6/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=290406f9382166ae917880b97e91a643","title":"may faces brexit defeat as labour backs customs union amendment","story":"Amendment would force UK to join customs union if no agreement on trade is reachedTheresa May faces a damaging Commons defeat, as Labour confirmed it would back an amendment tabled by rebel Tory MPs seeking to ensure Britain remains in a customs union after Brexit.The prime minister’s Brexit plans could be thrown into further disarray with two more pro-EU government ministers understood to be considering quitting their roles in order to back the move on Tuesday.Tory remainers Nicky Morgan and Stephen Hammond have tabled an amendment to the trade bill under which Britain would be forced to join a customs union with the EU if no agreement were reached on frictionless trade by 21 January 2019.The pro-European group believes it has at least 10 Tory MPs prepared to support its plans in the vote on Tuesday night, and possibly more, with the ministers among those considering joining the rebels.Labour also confirmed it would vote against the plan to bring forward the summer recess to Thursday this week, putting Tory MPs in the invidious position of having to defend voting for an early break to their constituents.It would also mean that there would be almost no time for Tory MPs to hold a confidence vote in the prime minister if one was called.Leavers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg forced the government on Monday to back four amendments to Brexit legislation, including one intended to scupper May’s plans for a new customs deal. The concession infuriated Tory remainers.May was on Tuesday morning debating her next move with her cabinet at Downing Street after denials that the changes killed her Chequers plan, which faces a precarious path through the Commons.A senior Labour source said: “We saw yesterday there is no majority for May’s Chequers’ agreement. But there is a majority for a customs union. Today parliament has the chance to change the course of the Brexit negotiations, protect jobs and the economy. Fingers crossed the Lib Dems turn up.”The Brexiters defeated the most controversial amendments by just three votes on Monday night. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, and his predecessor Tim Farron were both criticised for missing the vote.Hammond told the : “Our new clause supports keeping Chequers on the road and personally I think that’s very important because it’s the best chance for a negotiation and therefore I hope the government accepts new clause 18 as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b42ea3484aa0b00fcaefee1db017c6cf87fd0cf/0_33_2336_1401/master/2336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a524389a8d47c618d0cf5c85e98ad4","title":"religious education needs overhaul to reflect uk says report","story":"Ex-education secretary says assemblies, syllabus and admissions policy need changeReligious education in schools is outdated and should be replaced with a new subject: religion, belief and values, and the right of parents to withdraw their children from classes should be scrapped, according to the former Labour education secretary Charles Clarke.Significant shifts in the UK since the Education Act 1944 mean changes to the way religion and belief is taught in schools to reflect modern Britain are long overdue, Clarke and his co-author Linda Woodhead, a professor in the department of politics, philosophy and religion at Lancaster University, say in a pamphlet published on Tuesday.In the 1940s, Britain was a predominantly Christian country. Now a majority of people say they have no religion, and there are parts of the country where people of other religions form a significant proportion of the population.A new nationally determined syllabus called religion, belief and values should replace religious education and be obligatory in all state-funded schools. At the moment, each education authority sets its own RE syllabus.Faith schools could provide additional teaching if desired. Parents should no longer have the right to withdraw children from the syllabus. “Religion, belief and values should be a proper educational subject like any other,” Clarke told the .Daily collective worship of “a broadly Christian character”, which is a legal requirement under the 1944 act, should be replaced with a requirement for all state-funded schools to hold a “regular assembly or act of collective worship in keeping with the values and ethos of the school and reflecting the ersity and character of the school community”, the pamphlet says.An estimated one in three state schools flout the current statutory requirement. “The answer is not to insist on enforcement of an inadequate law, but to change the requirement in order to reflect society today,” said Clarke.Clarke and Woodhead propose changes to the admissions criteria of faith schools to broaden their intake. The children of families which follow a particular faith should continue to be given priority for admission to schools of that religion, but the proportion admitted on faith criteria should be reduced.“Where admission on the basis of faith is taking place, care is needed to look at the overall effect on society and integration. There is no reason at all that faith schools cannot continue to maintain a distinctive faith ethos and values – this does not depend on selection criteria,” says the pamphlet.There are nearly 7,000 faith schools in England and Wales out of more than 24,000 schools in total. The Church of England runs 4,700 schools, which are open to children of all faiths and no faith on the basis that they serve the local population rather than being faith schools for the faithful.The pamphlet, A New Settlement Revised: Religion and Belief in Schools, follows an earlier set of proposals by the same authors published in 2015. In the past three years they have consulted more than 100 public figures and experts on the issues.“The law has become a barrier to schools’ ability to help their children understand their own situation and the world in which they are growing up,” said Clarke.Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said the report was timid and reinforced the status quo: “Far too many concessions are made to vested interests of religious organisations for this to be a report we can be enthusiastic about.”He said it was disappointing that Clarke and Woodhead had rowed back on their previous recommendation to scrap the requirement for religious worship in schools, and that the report supported faith schools.“In an increasingly erse, increasingly fractured, and increasingly irreligious society, it is as clear as ever that a ‘new settlement’ is needed to end the religious ides entrenched by the current education system,” said Copson.The independent commission on religious education, set up to review RE teaching in schools, is to make its final recommendations by the end of 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3799c3b8a9d845d09431a19596e41ff9f0ffcdf7/0_179_1361_817/master/1361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4269f1b2157c68197bea386923143654","title":"vote leave broke electoral law and british democracy is shaken","story":"The record is not encouraging over whether senior Tory Brexiters will be held to accountVote Leave has been fined £61,000 after being found guilty of breaking electoral law during the Brexit campaign. Two people have been referred to the police. But with this initial investigation concluded, Britain faces a difficult period of soul searching over what to do about this evidence of extensive wrongdoing.A democracy is only as strong as the elections that set its course. If they can be bought or subverted, then confidence in democracy and the legitimacy of the governments it installs, seeps away.But astonishingly, the details that have been gradually revealed, of illegal activity by both the official Vote Leave and the unofficial Leave.EU campaigns in the run-up to the Brexit vote, appear to have no immediate consequences.Most British elections are guaranteed by law. If evidence of serious cheating is uncovered they can be scrutinised and overturned in an “election court”, formed from high court judges. However, because the Brexit referendum was only an advisory vote there are no legal channels to challenge the result. Only parliament can investigate the result, declare it void or demand a re-run.Nor have the powerful politicians who fronted the flawed Vote Leave campaign faced direct censure, even as the country is rocked by the tumultuous fallout from a vote that is now known to be flawed.The Electoral Commission’s report established that BeLeave was operating as an arm of Vote Leave, which had won official status and the taxpayer money that entailed, partly by recruiting Conservative party luminaries. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was co-chair and the former foreign minister Boris Johnson was a figurehead for the campaign. But the report names only Darren Grimes, an inexperienced student at the time of the poll, and the previously obscure Vote Leave official David Halsall.Both Gove and Johnson had once been quick to dismiss critics of the Vote Leave campaign. In March Johnson described the Observer’s report on the campaign group’s coordination with BeLeave as “ludicrous” and said Vote Leave won “fair and square”. Yet both men have been conspicuously silent since the Election Commission report was released – along with other senior government or Conservative figures who sat on the Vote Leave committee. These include Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith, the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, and the former international development secretary Priti Patel.It is unclear whether the British media will try to hold Gove, Johnson and other senior Vote Leave figures to account over the cheating where the Electoral Commission was not able to do so. The record so far has not been encouraging.Editors at the BBC must be questioning – or should now be questioning – why they gave the Vote Leave CEO, Matthew Elliott, virtually free rein to attack the watchdog and present his version of the report days before its official release. His account differed significantly from the published report.Too often over the two years since the referendum any efforts to question or investigate the Brexit campaigns have been dismissed as undemocratic sabotage, the work of bitter losers.In fact, exposing fraud is a profoundly democratic enterprise, an act of commitment to ensuring that votes are respected. And yet journalists, lawyers and researchers digging into these questions began with very little political support.The Electoral Commission’s findings on Vote Leave – after it was forced to reopen an investigation that previously cleared the campaign group – have been a vindication of its work. Yet this was only one fight, over one aspect of a campaign still shadowed by other serious questions about the legality of campaigns and funding, and several ongoing investigations. The original source of more than £400,000 donated to the Democratic Unionist party’s Brexit campaign remains obscure, and the government has fought efforts to uncover details about the cash, officially provided by a small thinktank.The Electoral Commission has been looking into whether the Brexit donor Arron Banks’s Better for the Country was the “true source of donations” to the leave campaigns. The Sunday Times has also reported that the National Crime Agency has been investigating Banks’s alleged Russian links. Separately, the Information Commissioner’s Office is conducting an inquiry into potential data sharing between groups, including Brexit campaigns. The politan police have an inquiry into Liz Bilney, the CEO of Leave.EU, after the Electoral Commission ruled that Banks’s campaign had exceeded its spending limits.The Electoral Commission has also put out an urgent plea for stronger laws and greater resources to protect British democracy.Only months before the UK is due to leave the EU, with huge political and economic upheaval, it is reasonable to expect that part of the response to this report must focus on whether the decision to do so was legitimate.Yet, in some ways, to argue about whether illegal spending by Vote Leave, Leave.EU – or possibly others – was enough to swing this hard-fought referendum is to sidestep more profound concerns about the implications of those actions.The people who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign currently face little more than a rap over the knuckles for cheating. But their actions have been described by Gavin Millar QC as being of a “scale and seriousness” not known in the modern era, and which has potentially reshaped Britain’s future.The barrister and election expert Adam Wagner spelled it out: “What is the point of having strict rules over elections and referendums if there are no consequences for them being broken?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43e10c4a6743736fb96963afcfb3e94db699d577/165_207_817_490/master/817.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ebc7af8f453c9f0163c522a1f24039d","title":"astronomers discover 12 new moons orbiting jupiter","story":"A head-on collision between two Jovian moons would create a crash so large it would be visible from earthOne of a dozen new moons discovered around Jupiter is circling the planet on a suicide orbit that will inevitably lead to its violent destruction, astronomers say.Researchers in the US stumbled upon the new moons while hunting for a mysterious ninth planet that is postulated to lurk far beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most distant planet in the solar system.The team first glimpsed the moons in March last year from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, but needed more than a year to confirm that the bodies were locked in orbit around the gas giant. “It was a long process,” said Scott Sheppard, who led the effort at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, was hardly short of moons before the latest findings. The fresh haul of natural satellites brings the total number of Jovian moons to 79, more than are known to circle any other planet in our cosmic neighbourhood.Nine of the new moons belong to an outer group that orbit Jupiter in retrograde, meaning they travel in the opposite direction to the planet’s spin. They are thought to be the remnants of larger parent bodies that were broken apart in collisions with asteroids, comets and other moons. Each takes about two years to circle the planet.Two more of the moons are in a group that circle much closer to the planet in prograde orbits which travel in the same direction as Jupiter’s spin. Most likely to be pieces of a once larger moon that was broken up in orbit, they take nearly a year to complete a lap around Jupiter. Which direction the moons swing around the planet depends on how they were first captured by Jupiter’s gravitational field.Astronomers describe the twelfth new Jovian moon as an “oddball”. Less than a kilometre wide, the tiny body circles Jupiter on a prograde orbit but at a distance that means it crosses the path of other moons hurtling towards it. Scientists have named the new moon Valetudo after the Roman god Jupiter’s great-granddaughter, the goddess of health and hygiene. But given the impending violence, it may be more than coincidence that Vale Tudo, which translates from Portuguese as “anything goes”, is an early form of full-contact mixed martial arts. “Valetudo is like driving down the highway on the wrong side of the road,” said Sheppard. “It is moving prograde while all the other objects at a similar distance from Jupiter are moving retrograde. Thus head-on collisions are likely.”Sheppard, whose report appears in the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Electronic Circular, suspects that Valetudo is the final remnant of a once much larger moon that has been ground to dust by collisions in the past. Which raises the question of how long the tiny moon has left. “Collisions don’t happen all that frequently, every billion years or so,” said Sheppard. “If one did happen, we would be able to detect it from Earth, but it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d24a7e65b688a3f0685d2417b2df42a9ab8ac10/157_34_2471_1482/master/2471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4a5b32e22e5e23c1c85ac7d7d0e3b92","title":"tiger woods the open 2018 golf carnoustie","story":"Tiger Woods believes the Open Championship provides his best opportunity to claim a 15th major. A decade has passed since Woods last won any of golf’s marquee events – in that instance, the US Open – with subsequent struggles largely linked to injury.Speaking at Carnoustie on Tuesday, ahead of his 20th Open appearance, Woods initially smiled when asked whether this tournament offers his biggest major chance. “Not to be smart, but it is the next major I’m playing,” said the 42-year-old, before taking matters more seriously.“You get to places like Augusta National where it’s just a big ballpark and the golf course outgrows you, unfortunately. That’s just the way it goes. But links-style golf course, you can roll the ball. I hit a three-iron that went to 330 yards out here. Even if I get\u0026nbspa little bit older, I can still chase some wood or long club down there and hit the ball the same distance.“So distance becomes a moot point\u0026nbspon a links-style course. But creativity plays such an important role, and you’ve got guys like Tom playing late in his career, doing well. There’s a reason why he won five of these – very creative and hit all the shots.”Woods, a three-times Open winner, hasn’t featured in golf’s oldest major since 2015. His last and fourth back surgery had triggered inner doubts over whether he would return to a competitive environment.“There were definitely points in time that I certainly thought I’d never play in this championship again,” he admitted. “It’s great seeing it on TV, but it’s even better in person. I remember how it feels to come down to the last\u0026nbsphole with a chance to win it. And knowing that I may never have that opportunity again, there were some times in there where I just didn’t feel very good.“But now to have the opportunity to come back to Carnoustie to play here in Scotland again, I’ve said this\u0026nbspbefore throughout this year, it’s been a blessing. There were some times where I didn’t think I’d ever be able to do this again, and – lo and behold – here I am playing my third major of the year. I’ve progressed throughout the year and had some nice little momentum things, building blocks, which is positive.“Each tournament I keep coming back to, I keep feeling a little bit better because I’m starting to play some golf again. My feels are much better than they were at the beginning of the year and I feel like I have a better understanding of my game and my body and my swing.“That’s just going to come with a little bit more experience and I think that I’ve made a few adjustments. I’ve changed putters. I’ve tweaked my swing a little bit and everything’s gotten just a little bit better. I’ve put myself up there in contention a couple times. I just need to play some cleaner golf and who knows?”Course strategy has been at the forefront of early Open week discussion. Rory McIlroy has been candid about the fact he plans to use a series of drivers from tees, a policy not\u0026nbsplikely to be followed by Woods. In 2006 Woods famously won the Open at Hoylake – where scorched conditions were similar to Carnoustie now – while using his driver only once in four rounds.“There’s not a lot of opportunities to hit the driver just because the ball is going to be rolling 80 yards,” Woods said. “It’s just hard to keep the ball in\u0026nbspplay. Even hitting sometimes four\u0026nbspand five irons, they’ve been running 50, 60 yards.”Woods has a special affiliation with Carnoustie, having visited for the first time as an amateur for the 1995 Scottish Open. He recalls that experience well. “It was one of the cooler things, just standing on that range and hitting the ball to the 100-yard sign. I was hitting nine-irons and four-irons and five-irons, just having a blast trying to hit the sign.“I hadn’t been able to do that before. I had never played links golf. This was my first time. I remember my dad on the range with me saying: ‘Are you ever going to hit the ball past the 100 yard sign?” And I said: ‘No, I’m just enjoying this. Are you kidding me? This is the best.’ So I spent probably about close to two hours on the range just hitting balls before I even went and played because I thought it was just the best, seeing the ball bounce and being creative and using my mind.“I grew up in Southern California where it’s kikuyu grass nothing rolls. So everything’s vertical. So to come here and I remember going down No 2, I was about probably close to 120 yards out and bringing out my putter and putting it – I’d never done that before. That was one of the cooler moments. It stuck with me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8c3753262aba4a78b2c1aaa69cbf3ef65d0a45/0_233_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed9e508b8f77583a65289281cb7563b","title":"tour de france stage 10","story":"Greg Van Avermaet extended his lead in the yellow jersey with a superb ride as Julian Alaphilippe won stage 10 of the Tour de France.Van Avermaet was expected to surrender the race lead he has held since the stage three team time trial as the race moved into the Alps, but the Olympic champion defied predictions as he joined a breakaway and stayed away on the road to Le Grand-Bornand.The BMC rider crossed the line at the end of the 158.5km stage from Annecy fourth on the stage but around a minute and a half ahead of the main group of contenders, which included Team Sky’s Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas, plus Adam Yates of Mitchelton-Scott.Alaphilippe, 26, delivered his first career Tour stage win after moving off the front of the break at the summit of the Col de Romme, 28.5km from home.The Quick-Step Floors rider gradually pulled away as he turned a bid for the climbers’ polka-dot jersey into a first French stage win of this Tour.After his BMC team-mate Richie Porte crashed out of the Tour on Sunday, Van Avermaet started the second week with no agenda but to stay in yellow as long as he could, and put in a ride to honour the jersey here.He joined an 18-strong break that had moved seven minutes clear by the time they crested the summit of the Montee du plateau des Glieres, heading on to the gravel roads over the plateau made famous by the French resistance in second world war.Sky were pacing the peloton behind but after slowing the pace to wait for Froome – who suffered a puncture on the gravel – they could not fully reel in the break.The provisional general classification showed Van Avermaet’s lead over Thomas growing to two minutes and 22 seconds, with Movistar’s Alejandro Valverde up to third, three minutes and 10 seconds down.Jeremy Whittle’s stage report will appear here shortly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ce2f191b549a0fc708d730e05a3afb4f96ce9f/0_169_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa54d8c8840cd24397d337d2bcc4bb0","title":"womens super league kicks off the spin cricket","story":"With eight new teams set to step in, grounds like Bristol may soon be stripped of top-class women’s T20 actionIt was about this time last year that there was a seismic shift in cricket in this country.

And yet, and yet … there is trouble ahead.As things stand, this is the KSL’s penultimate year. After 2019, there will be no more high-class T20 domestic cricket for women in the UK. The six existing teams will be thrown up in the air and eight new women’s teams will come into existence, alongside the new men’s teams in the ECB’s proposed city-based 100-ball competition. A format that no other country in the world plays, and that currently doesn’t exist.There has been more than considerable disquiet from women players – who will have no way of practising for international T20 cricket – from fans and from domestic administrators, who have thrown the weight of their club’s efforts and resources behind the KSL.Will Brown is chief executive of Gloucestershire CCC – joint-home of Western Storm, the current KSL champions. He was pressing the flesh in a marquee at the Cheltenham festival – where next week Western Storm will play for the first time.Brown, who arrived at Gloucestershire five years ago, is a huge advocate for the women’s game. His trepidation about the proposed changes is palpable. Should Western Storm disappear, should there be no more T20 top-class women’s cricket at Bristol, Brown’s feelings are clear.“We’d be devastated. We’ve committed and worked hard for the women’s game because we believe in it. It would be pretty devastating if we have been backing women’s cricket for a length of time and it is taken away from us.“We want to see the women’s and girls game grow across the region for many reasons – firstly, it is bloody good cricket and we want to be part of it. Secondly, for social wellbeing and for health reasons – if people walk away from watching a cricket game and feel inspired to go and play tennis or have a long walk, that doesn’t matter to me – we’ve still inspired. And also research shows that women usually are in charge of what the family do and how they spend their money.“We’ve spent a lot of time promoting and working for the game. We’ve invested money in having satellite winter bases and branded them Little Stormers. We’ve sold a lot of tickets and we’ve been able to get a sponsor and we’ve reinvested that money.”The interest is actually quantifiable in tweets. When the Western Storm Twitter account announced that Indian opener Smriti Mandhana was going to join the club in June – the first Indian to play in the KSL – there were more retweets and more likes than any other tweet in the club’s history … including when the men’s team won the 2015 Royal London Cup .But, should nothing change – and there has been talk of a possible Women’s T20 domestic competition from 2020 – Western Storm is on its last legs. And as the West of England franchise has gone to Cardiff there will be no 100-ball games at Bristol or Taunton.Brown is nervous. “I know that there are discussions going on but it is a very unnerving time for us. We are big supporters of the 100 – we recognise the need for another tournament, but I’d like to see a remodelling of the women’s game altogether – the 100 can be whatever it is, an entry-level product, a marketing-led product – but we need to make sure that the infrastructure is underpinned properly. How far can we go to modelling the men’s game – with a T20, 50-over and Championship competition? It will cost money – but if you want results, you have to invest it properly.”Meanwhile the ECB has announced trial 100-ball matches this September, at Trent Bridge for the men, and at Loughborough for the women.

Perhaps he does fancy a hundred after all. 41st over: England 239-2 (Root 86, Morgan 85) Kumar contines, and Morgan tries to keep everyone awake by attempting a big yahoo that produces only a Harrow cut. Root, in no such hurry, picks up a couple of singles. At this stage, India were 199-6.40th over: England 236-2 (Root 84, Morgan 84) Only three off the over from Thakur. Has anyone got anything to say?39th over: England 233-2 (Root 82, Morgan 83) Morgan sneaks ahead of Root, not that it will bother either of them. There’s unlikely to be time for a hundred, but they’ve both played well enough to deserve one. Only 24 needed now. Get them off one over!38th over: England 229-2 (Root 81, Morgan 80) Root picks Kuldeep’s googly and plays it quite beautifully, opening the face to glide it for three, off middle and off. Morgan, sensing that Kuldeep might be feeling crestfallen, rubs it in with a six to long-on.And here’s Tom Adam. “I am listening to TMS in the background (so sorry darling, it’s not you, it’s me) and the crowd sounds on the effects mikes are just as if we are playing away. So Root smacks a glorious boundary … and there is utter crowd silence. India go up for a dodgy LBW appeal … and the crowd bays for blood. I find this rather disconcerting. There’s something very odd about an English crowd watching England in England and cheering the opposition.” We’re not applying the Tebbit test, though, are we? Fans can cheer for whoever they want, and the vibrant support for India has been part of the fun of this series. 37th over: England 219-2 (Root 78, Morgan 73) Back comes Bhuvi Kumar, as Kohli fiddles with the stable door and the horse heads off into the distance. That’s drinks, with England needing only 38 off 13 overs, at a rate fractionally below three. I’m not sure they could mess this up if they were managed by Sam Allardyce.And here’s Ian Copestake. “Can cricket be used to explain Brexit, or used to cure the isions?” he wonders. “Do Brexiters despair watching English Indian fans at Headingley (and elsewhere)? I think I have answered my own questions. Carry on.”36th over: England 213-2 (Root 75, Morgan 70) Another decent over from Kuldeep, but decency is not enough. It’s all over bar the presentation.35th over: England 210-2 (Root 74, Morgan 69) Reprieved by the no-ball, Root celebrates with a lofted on-drive for four to leave Chahal nursing some wounded pride and figures of 10-0-41-0.It’s a no-ball. Got to feel for Chahal there – it would have been out.Mid-35th over: England 200-2 (Root 68, Morgan 69) Morgan thumps the first ball of Chahal’s last over for four to deep square, only to be beaten by a beauty that turns like something out of a song by Duckworth-Lewis. Then there’s a review for a stumping against Root... 34th over: England 196-2 (Root 68, Morgan 64) A better over from Kuldeep, who has answered the commentators’ plea and dropped his pace below 50. His series average, once in single figures, has ballooned to 15. 33rd over: England 193-2 (Root 67, Morgan 62) A few more singles off Chahal, who has kept the boundaries down, to just two off his nine overs, without providing the cutting edge that India were crying out for.“Brexit metaphors?” snorts Ravi Nair. “Brexit is going as well as an eggless flourless cake being cooked by focussed sunlight in an Antarctic winter snowstorm.”32nd over: England 188-2 (Root 65, Morgan 59) Kuldeep returns too, but he has gone from a magician to something manageable. England’s two captains take four off the over, which is now marginally more than they need.31st over: England 184-2 (Root 62, Morgan 58) Chahal commands respect, as he has all afternoon, without finding the breakthrough. In the absence of a decent contest, we need a new topic of conversation. How do you feel Brexit is going, then?30th over: England 181-2 (Root 60, Morgan 57) Morgan plays a pull for four off Thakur, who is then a touch unlucky as he persuades Root to edge a leg-glance and Dhoni misses a half-chance. That looks like that, but Kohli is trying spin again.29th over: England 175-2 (Root 59, Morgan 52) Root drives Pandya, loosely but not dangerously, to third man, to bring up the hundred partnership off 119 balls. It’s the second game in a row that Morgan and Root have done that. Root is heading for Man of the Series, but Morgan would be just as good a choice, after that brave decision to bat first at Lord’s.28th over: England 170-2 (Root 58, Morgan 50) Morgan, noticing that there’s no slip for poor old Thakur, plays a dinky deflection for four. A couple of singles later, he plays a more full-blooded shot outside off to reach fifty off 58 balls. Come on India, do something.27th over: England 165-2 (Root 57, Morgan 43) Back comes Pandya, who doesn’t concede a boundary. The trouble is, it’s all about wickets now. Only a classic English collapse will do, and there’s no sign of one – at the risk of setting off what was known in the press box during the 2005 Ashes as the Fate-Tempt-o-meter. 26th over: England 159-2 (Root 55, Morgan 40) Thakur continues, for reasons I can’t explain, and Morgan helps himself to a cut that is more of a shredding.25th over: England 152-2 (Root 54, Morgan 35) Root, spotting Kuldeep’s length early again, takes a big confident stride and cover-drives for four to bring up yet another fifty, his 41st in 116 ODIs (including the 12 hundreds). Morgan, not to be outdone, whacks a straight four with a shot that’s straight off the hockey field, all eye and wrist and self-belief.24th over: England 143-2 (Root 49, Morgan 31) Kohli, in desperation, goes back to seam in the form of Thakur. He concedes a few singles and when he tries a bouncer, it’s given as a wide, which rather sums up India’s day. They need to manufacture a wicket, by hook or by crook: then they’re down to Ben Stokes, who is well out of form.23rd over: England 138-2 (Root 47, Morgan 29) Kuldeep returns, and after a couple of dots Root plays a classy sweep, all along the ground and fine enough to beat short fine leg.“Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon, Nick Parish. “This is a slightly different riff – obviously this is a terrible cover but it firmly crosses over into ‘so bad it’s good’ territory. After all, who wouldn’t want to hear Lemmy singing about how hard it is to be a woman on this cover of Stand By Your Man?” Who indeed. 22nd over: England 134-2 (Root 43, Morgan 29) Chahal keeps it tight again. He’s conceded only 21 off seven overs, but he hasn’t been able to give Kohli the one thing he craves: a wicket.21st over: England 131-2 (Root 41, Morgan 28) Morgan, facing Raina again, is like a man returning to the hotel buffet. He gives himself room outside off to play a lofted cover drive, and follows it up with something more orthodox, and just as clinical, in the same direction.20th over: England 121-2 (Root 40, Morgan 19) A tidier over from Chahal, but it will take more than tidiness to turn this round. 19th over: England 119-2 (Root 39, Morgan 18) Kohli turns to his third spinner, Raina – the option Morgan didn’t go for with Root. Raina drops too short and after Root misses out, Morgan thumps him to the square-leg fence. That’s drinks, with England nearly half-way to a big win.18th over: England 112-2 (Root 38, Morgan 12) Chahal half-deceives Morgan, twice, but fortune is favouring England after their bold start.“Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon, Brian Withington, where on earth have you been? “Talking of Iceland and cover versions, you would need to travel a very long way indeed to find a better cover of anything than this collaboration between Todmobile and Jon Anderson. Like a Vince cover drive on a sunny afternoon - sublime.”17th over: England 112-2 (Root 38, Morgan 12) More of the same. Kohli is trying to make something happen, but it’s just not working: the spin twins have none for 38 off eight overs.16th over: England 108-2 (Root 35, Morgan 11) Root plays an uppish tuck, not unlike the one that did for Bairstow, but he evades the man at midwicket. He’s motoring along at a run a ball, right back in form.15th over: England 103-2 (Root 31, Morgan 10) The Indians have been guilty of a few misfields and another one brings Root two overthrows, to turn a single into three. Morgan feels relaxed enough to pull out the reverse sweep, which brings another three, and that’s the hundred up, off 88 balls. England are well on top, but they still have a wobble in them. 14th over: England 96-2 (Root 27, Morgan 7) Root, using his feet like a dancer, spies a low full toss from Chahal and sweeps it for four. That’s five overs of spin that England have survived already, and they’ve taken 22 off them, which is all they need.13th over: England 91-2 (Root 22, Morgan 7) Root is continuing with the masterclass in footwork that he began at Lord’s. He goes right forward to cover-drive Kuldeep for four, then right back to work him to midwicket’s right.12th over: England 85-2 (Root 17, Morgan 6) Chahal has another shout for LBW against Morgan, but his leg-break is doing a bit too much. But he gets a moral victory, and a row of five dots before Morgan pushes up to long-on.11th over: England 84-2 (Root 17, Morgan 5) Kohli, spotting that England only need four and a half an over, goes for spin at both ends. Root seizes on a short one from Kuldeep, goes right back and somehow pulls it for four without hitting his wicket. Meanwhile Kimberley Thonger is getting ever keen on the idea of an Icelandic tour. “Combining the Iceland and cover version themes, I vouchsafe the proposed touring side team song could be I’ve Got A Luvverly Bunch Of Coconuts in a Björk style, accompanied by Sigur Rós on the marimba.”10th over: England 78-2 (Root 12, Morgan 4) Chahal’s first over has it all: the run-out, a strong shout for LBW as Morgan misses a big leg-break (off-break to him), and then a cracking four as Morgan latches onto a long hop. “Indian curry,” says a banner, “make England worry.”It was tight, but not tight enough to save Vince, who was undone by some smart work from Dhoni, grabbing a throw and flattening the stumps in one motion. So Dhoni redeems himself, and poor old Vince, who hesitated fatally after Root’s call, is left to rue yet another elegant 20-odd.An appeal for run out against Vince, which looks very tight.9th over: England 74-1 (Vince 27, Root 12) Root pulls Thakur for an imperious four, then takes a single and tells Vince that Thakur has resorted to cutters. Kohli is so grumpy that he’s off the field, presumably discussing what the hell he can do next. It looks straightforward from here: either the Indian spinners rip through England, or the series is lost. It’s all down to Kuldeep and Chahal.8th over: England 67-1 (Vince 26, Root 5) Vince at his Vinceyest, standing up straight and creaming an off-drive, before going back to whip to long leg. Kumar has now gone for eight fours off four overs, and to add insult to insult, Dhoni is standing up to him.“My brain has been trying to take the intersection of cricket and cover versions to a new level,” says Peter Salmon, “by thinking about cricketers who are cover versions of earlier cricketers.” Nice. “For instance it seems that it is the law that you can’t talk about Josh Hazlewood without mentioning Glenn McGrath. When James Vince came into the side he was always shackled to Michael Vaughan. Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed. Any others?”7th over: England 57-1 (Vince 17, Root 5) Root at his Rootiest, going up on his toes to subject a perfectly respectable ball from Thakur to his back-foot caress for four. That brings the fifty up off 38 balls, and it’s followed by four leg byes as Dhoni adds a bit of incompetence to his intransigence. Has he lost it, do you think? 6th over: England 49-1 (Vince 17, Root 1) Joe Root nearly perishes to a comedy run-out – Vince’s revenge, perhaps, for being made to bat at three in Australia. Then Vince has a near-miss too, playing a Harrow cut for four. A better over from Kumar, who has changed ends in a bid to shake off the rust.5th over: England 43-1 (Vince 12, Root 0) So Kohli was rushed into his first bowling change, but it worked, as Shardul Thakur nabbed the big wicket. Game on. John Starbuck’s mention of possible tour of Iceland gets Kimberley Thonger going. “If there’s a requirement for a short portly military medium right arm over with Devon Malcolm tendencies in the batting department, I’m your man,” he says, irresistibly. “Available weekends until 18th December when I’m assisting SWMBO on a Hapsburg historical research venture in Segovia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47062c542a3a1c992b3d0394e956df6dbab98014/0_200_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfef49dbf0037abf17f7bfe35e82cd09","title":"tour de france 2018 stage 10 takes race into the alps live","story":"Julian Alaphilippe surged away to take a superb solo victory as the race reached the AlpsRight, that’s it from me! Thanks for your company and be sure to head back here for stage 11 tomorrow where this faces the peloton:And, in case you missed it, here’s our report on La Course earlier:Here’s our snap race report:Here’s the final kilometre of a fine ride:Here’s Egan Bernal: “I felt good. I can work for the team. Froome and Thomas felt good in the mountains.”Next over the line is the GC group, of around 15 riders, containing all of the biggest names. Of the GC outsiders, Mollema, Zakarin, Van Garderen, Majka and Jungels are the ones to lose time.Calmejane is next over the line, 2min 23sec down on Alaphilippe.Tears for Alaphilippe as he’s surrounded by his team. Meanwhile, 1min 30sec down, Taaramae and Izagirre cross the line. And right on their heels are Van Avermaet and Pauwels. Van Avermaet extends his lead in yellow. Wow.The Frenchman crosses the line. What a superb ride that was – he looked a winner from the first few kilometres.Alaphilippe goes under the Flamme Rouge. One kilometre to go.Yep, as I rather suspected, Van Avermaet still has plenty of time on the GC group – over two minutes. He’s going to extend his lead.Alaphilippe enters beautiful Le Grand-Bornand with just 3km to go to glory.The time data is slightly all over the place again, but it appears the peloton are closing in on Van Avermaet. He should still have enough to hold on to yellow.As we saw in La Course earlier, the final 500m or so of this stage bring a sting in the tail. Alaphilippe, though, isn’t leading by 20 seconds – he has close to two minutes now. With 7km to go, barring something incredibly unfortunate, this is going to be a wonderful maiden victory in the Tour for the French rider.Dan Martin attacks from the GC group, scuppering what was going to be quite a good “Pressure on Julian (Alaphillipe)” Blur reference (as my musical references are very much on point. The Irishman leads them over the top but only a few metres from the bunch. Jungels begins to fall of the back of the peloton as Sky look to turn the screw on the front. Kwiatkowski rolls off the front of the Sky train, leaving Poels to set the pace. The crowds are out in force at the top of the Colombiere as Alaphilippe crests the col. He has 14.7km to the finish line, almost all downhill.There’s around 22 riders in the Froome group heading up the mountain. All the chief contenders are there – Valverde, Majka, Fuglsang, Yates, Landa, Nibali, Roglic etc and so forth – with Uran and Zakarin clinging on at the back.Van Avermaet still has a 3min 40sec lead over the peloton, with 2km to the summit. He looks set to hold onto yellow, for one more day at least. What a ride. Chapeau.Alaphilippe’s lead is up over a minute now, with Taaramae falling back. He has 3km to the summit. And still a near-six-minute gap on the peloton.We’ve just had one of my perennial favourite sights on a Tour de France – a French directeur sportif leaning out of the window of a car to scream at a French rider who is away at the front of the race. Alaphillipe was on the receiving end from the Quickstep team car. Always makes me think of this:The peloton hit the bottom of the climb. Will anyone put in a meaningful attack? Alaphilippe hits the bottom of the final Col. He has over five minutes on Froome and the GC contenders, over a minute on Van Avermaet and co, and 26 seconds on Rein Taaramae.Van Avermaet, along with Gesink, Calmejane and Izagirre reach the summit around 45 seconds behind Alaphillipe.Team Sky still have six riders on the front of the peloton as they sweep up the stragglers from the earlier break. Alaphilippe, meanwhile, has dropped Taaramae and is riding himself into polka dots.Indeed Alaphilippe has dropped his young countryman and reached Taaramae.Gaudu and Alaphilippe are the pair hunting down Taaramae.Taaramae has 40 seconds on the chasers, where Alaphilippe and a couple of cohorts are beginning to drop the estimable Greg van Avermaet.Taaramae has just 23 seconds on the yellow jersey group. Meanwhile, Barguil has been swept up by the peloton and might end up being spat out the back. Barguil has spoke about deliberately losing time in order to go for stage wins … but at 2min 37sec down he could ride himself into yellow in he makes this attack work. He’s a long, long way from the finish line though and has more than five minutes to make up on Taaramae and co at the front of the race.The pace is shredding the back of the pack – by the time we get to the summit of the Col de Romme we’ll have a very select group at the front of the race. Warren Barguil attacks from the peloton. No reaction from the bunch as yet.Astana, Movistar and Team Sky are prominent on the front of the group. Meanwhile, Taaramae has made his move stick and has a few seconds on the rest of the leaders.Taaramae jumps off the front, completing the old one-two from Direct Energie. Meanwhile, five and a half minutes down the road, the peloton have reached the foot of the climb.Attacks from the front. Calmejane – again – steps up the pace. He has a Direct Energie teammate in the break, in the shape of Rein Taaramae. Impey is the next to drop off the back.The early slopes of this climb are the steepest and the break is quickly labouring. Gilbert immediately falls off the back.The break hit the foot of the climb with an advantage of just over six minutes – very much a will-they-won’t-they lead.Here are the two final climbs of the day, followed by 13km downhill and a little ramp to the finish (as Anna van der Breggen discovered to her cost earlier):Before we hit the penultimate climb of the day, take a minute to read up on the extraordinary finale to La Course earlier. Here’s Jeremy Whittle’s report:Sagan at last gets swept up into the peloton, along with his teammate Lukas Postlburger, the Austrian national road race champion. The pair wave at the Sky train as it trundles past.Sign up now! Up now sign! Now sign up! Sign up now!There’s just over 55km to go – given the terrain ahead that means about 90 minutes of racing is still ahead. The breakaway group still have over seven minutes. The first haymaker of the finishing double-punch, the Col de Romme, starts with around 37km to go.Ah, I miss Tour Tommy V.Froome’s issues have slowed an already not-exactly-flying peloton further so that gap to the break has grown once more. There’s enough buffer now for someone to stay away. If his legs are there, it strikes me as a stage for Tony Gallopin, though he has 17 rivals in that lead group. Bardet is being paced back to the peloton after a mechanicalcomfort break. This wide, flat valley road is a good time to sort out any minor “inconveniences”. Another mechanical for Chris Froome on the valley road this time. It’s not a major problem for him, though, and he’ll quickly be back in the line.And as I type that, it drops below seven minutes – clearly some issue with the time gap data.There’s a stiff ramp here – the Col des Fleuries. It’s not categorised but it’s still tough. The lead for the break is close to eight minutes now.Van Avermaet’s grip on the yellow jersey is tightening too – he’s still in the lead group. Of the other riders up front, Calmejane is just over 5min behind on GC, as is Serge Pauwels. There’s a chance for the 14-man breakaway here – the lead is over seven minutes now. Froome is safely back in the peloton, having bagged a wheel from Jonathan Castroviejo.Why always him? If one rider was to puncture on this gravel section – and it does seem to be only one – Chris Froome would be your first guess.Team Sky and the peloton hit the gravel path now. On the way up, by the by, the leaders were jumped by a mountain biker:Also well worth mentioning is the fact that the top of this mountain is home to the national museum to the French Resistance. More than 100 resistance fighters were killed by the Wehrmacht on these hills during a battle in the second world war.The uphill section of the gravel is a little more lumpy but I’ve seen cycle paths in the UK that are much, much worse. (Though that may say more about the UK’s cycle paths than it does about the road at the top of the Glières.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6f66197712174023653613ec15feb1f5580579/0_57_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35804c6618b07a64d50711fbf9979cee","title":"always go slightly too far what makes ambush tv work who is america","story":"Sacha Baron Cohen’s Who Is America? follows a long line of TV troublemakers who fooled guests into self-sabotage, but his scattergun approach risks missing the markIf you’re going to pull TV pranks, it helps if you’re punching up. And you can’t set your sights much higher than the president of the US. Furthermore, if you’re going to prank any US administration, it may as well be the leadership grouping centred around the uniquely unstable cocktail of ego, malevolence, incompetence and absurdity that is Donald Trump. Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, Who Is America?, may not make it as far as the big man, but his ambition is clear. He did get as far as Sarah Palin who, hilariously, has complained that Baron Cohen “duped her”.Baron Cohen and Trump have previous. Somehow, Trump not only survived but prospered after his 2003 encounter with his character Ali G, who tried to pitch him a glove designed for wearing while eating ice-cream. This encounter has only acquired resonance in retrospect. Ali G’s various provocations rarely carried much in the way of moral weight. For nostalgic lefties of a certain age, there’s still a great deal of pleasure to be derived from watching him being gently schooled by a magnificently earnest Tony Benn (“Is it called the welfare state because it’s well fair?”). But, in fact, most of Ali G’s work was just gloriously daft. With Candid Camera having launched way back in 1948, the ambush prank show has deep roots. But variations on the format went into overdrive in the 1990s, a decade that, surely not coincidentally, saw celebrity culture spiral out of control. The form ided into three distinct strains. There were celebrity botherers, such as Paul Kaye’s berserk red carpet wraith Dennis Pennis. There were the old-school public pranksters, still taking their cue from the decidedly trad likes of Game for a Laugh. And then there were the worthy likes of Mark Thomas, who used pranks to punctuate and enliven admirable but often slightly dry activism. Then Chris Morris changed everything. In 1997, Brass Eye redefined the notion of TV celebrity pranking and rendered it almost obsolete. Brass Eye was ludicrous, hilarious and satirically deadly. The true colours of many public figures were revealed – they only fell for Morris if they were gullible (David Amess), careless (Bruno Brookes), desperate (Wolf from Gladiators) or all three (too many to mention). Brass Eye was one of those very rare TV programmes to actually cause a change in media law. An amendment informally known as the Brass Eye clause – which allowed interviewees to be misled for the purposes of entertainment – was incorporated into the broadcasting code. Artistically, Brass Eye opened up a space into which dozens of imitators duly leapt. Many were dismal, but Baron Cohen instantly stood out, for his immersion in character, his eye for the absurd and his sheer nerve. So, what makes a prankster work? What separates Ali G from Trigger Happy TV? Often, it’s intangible: you either warm to them or you don’t. But there are a few ground rules. For a start, the softer the targets, the funnier, swifter and more generous the prankster has to be. Humiliating unwitting and undeserving members of the public is rarely a good look. For example, Billy Eichner’s periodically inspired Billy on the Street works because his marks are usually laughing, too. Second, understand your shelf life. Pranksters are TV’s fireflies. Like a punk anthem in human form, Dennis Pennis was obnoxious, brutally effective, frill-free and over in a flash. Baron Cohen effects regular and complete metamorphoses. Morris has simply moved on. Also, the stakes have to be reasonably high. Baron Cohen’s Borat singing what he claimed to be “the Kazakhstan national anthem” in front of a horde of furious rednecks at a rodeo in Texas definitely qualifies. The rag-week japesters of Revolting trying to make a point about the Daily Mail by harassing bewildered BBC employees during their lunch breaks definitely does not.Finally – and perhaps most importantly – always go slightly too far. Morris did not only attempt to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers. He attempted to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers wearing a nappy and a massive red balloon on his head. It’s here that Baron Cohen usually wins and, it appears, has won again. Who is America? has been billed as “the most dangerous show in the history of television”. Normally, this would sound hyperbolic. But, in this case, who knows? Like it or not, in satirical terms, the Trump White House (and its many bottom-feeding minions who Baron Cohen seems to have duped) represents the biggest of big game. If Baron Cohen is going to top this, Vladimir Putin had better keep his eyes peeled for an unfamiliar Ukrainian diplomat with an unplaceable accent and a slight air of mischief. Go on, Sacha, we dare you.

It will be written and co-executive-produced by Caroline Dries, best known as the executive producer of The Vampire Diaries. Dries has also worked with the network on shows such as Melrose Place and Smallville, another DC Comics property.The lead character, who will be introduced this December at the CW’s annual DC Comics crossover event, is described as a woman “armed with a passion for social justice and flair for speaking her mind”.Kate Kane is an out lesbian who has arrived in Gotham to handle a citywide resurgence in crime. “But don’t call her a hero yet,” reads the show’s synopsis. “In a city desperate for a savior, Kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham’s symbol of hope.”Originally introduced in the 1950s as a love interest for Batman to dispel rumors of homosexuality, Batwoman has since been the highest-profile openly gay character from any DC comic. In 2006, Batwoman was reintroduced as a lesbian of Jewish descent while Renee Montoya, a former Gotham police detective, was revealed as a love interest. At the time, Dan Didio, co-publisher of DC Comics, said Kane was written as a lesbian because “we wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase”.DC Comics have been at the forefront of LGBT visibility in comics, recently featuring the first gay superhero couple with Midnighter and Apollo and introducing The Ray as a gay man in the The Ray Rebirth. Supergirl, which airs on the CW, revealed in 2016 that the titular character’s sister Alex Danvers is a lesbian, and appears to be casting a transgender character in its new season. But other comic universes, like Marvel, have trailed when it comes to issues of queer representation. In last year’s big-screen version of Thor: Ragnarok, Tessa Thompson played Valkyrie, Marvel’s first ever openly bisexual character. But the actor later revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone that a scene confirming Valkyrie’s sexuality was cut from the film. If Batwoman is picked up for series, Kate Kane will become the first ever LGBT lead of a live-action superhero show. Moreover, December’s crossover event, which will feature the casts of Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Supergirl, will mark Batwoman’s first live-action appearance ever.

About 160,000 civilians have fled towards the Golan Heights, the region annexed by Israel from Syria.Syrian government forces have launched a brutal bombardment of the region around Quneitra in an effort to force the surrender of rebel groups that still control territory in the region.Israel has said it will not allow any refugees to cross the border, despite urgent calls by humanitarian agencies saying their safety is at risk. They are trapped between the Israeli border and advancing regime forces with little shelter from the harsh summer weather.The intensity of the bombardment was such that dozens sought refuge in Israel despite the country’s status as an archenemy of Syria. Israel has allowed a limited number of civilians as well as fighters entry into the country since 2013 for treatment from injuries - one report in 2017 said Israel had treated over 3,000 Syrians including 600 children since 2013. The regions of Deraa and Quneitra had long been considered areas of strategic importance where Israel hoped to limit the advance of Assad-aligned Iranian militias. But the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated last week that Israel would accept Syrian government control of the region.Reuters said the civilians retreated after being urged to do so by Israeli border guards.The Assad regime is expected to establish control over southern Syria in the coming days as it seeks a military victory over rebels in a seven-year civil war that was sparked by protesters demonstrating against the government torture of civilians in southern Syria.Last week the government hoisted its flag on rebel-controlled parts of Deraa, a symbolic victory in the birthplace of the uprising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c821b34aaf650dd67f6a94d537c96aabb6e3f49/0_334_4760_2858/master/4760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7844981a054c32ba3ae8bc0f2116f803","title":"hong kong moves to ban citys first pro independence party","story":"Hong Kong National party must explain why it should not be barred, in escalation of push to silence dissent against ChinaHong Kong is taking unprecedented steps to ban a pro-independence party, in the government’s strongest action yet against the movement pushing for separation from China.Police on Tuesday delivered documents to the Hong Kong National party founder, Andy Chan Ho-tin, detailing their recommendations to the city’s secretary of security that the group halt operations.The development marks the first time since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 that it has sought to outlaw a political organisation.A letter addressed to Chan said security officials believed the party should be shut down “in the interests of national security or public safety, public order or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”, according to photos of the documents posted on the group’s Facebook page.In a press conference, the Hong Kong security secretary, John Lee, said if the party was banned, anyone who attends meetings or gives money to the group could be punished with a fine of HKD$50,000 ($6,400) and two years in jail.“In Hong Kong we have freedom of association, but that right is not without restriction,” he said, according to Hong Kong Free Press.Chan, 27, a former Occupy Central activist who participated in a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2014, had already been barred from running in legislative elections in 2016. The party, started in 2016, calls for “an independent and free Republic of Hong Kong”.Chan has until 7 August to explain in writing why the party should not be banned, according to the documents. According to some, under the city’s mini-constitution, independence is a violation of the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong has operated since its return to China from British control.Under the system, Hong Kong is meant to operate under a “high degree of autonomy” with its own laws, courts, and freedoms. Critics say those freedoms are being erased.The potential ban comes at a time when authorities are putting more pressure on pro-democracy groups, calling any support of independence illegal, a challenge to the Chinese communist party, and a threat to national security. Candidates advocating a range of views, from calling for more self-determination for Hong Kong to all-out independence, have been banned from running or arrested.“The authorities must stop using vague laws to intimidate people who hold different political views. The attempt to ban the Hong Kong National party raises alarm bells as to what the government will look to curtail next in the name of national security,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International.The Hong Kong National party said on its Facebook page: “Today we Hong Kongers stand in opposition to our enemies, these Chinese colonisers and their puppets in the current Hong Kong government, and it is this antagonism that defines our movement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b2db556d1c1e73454fa3cb2dac476ba31ad5b6/0_143_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6588ad95b1868d12fb9d18c03d90d110","title":"india inspection missionaries of charity homes mother teresa","story":"India orders examination of all institutions run by her charity after claims against two staffIndia has ordered the immediate inspection of all childcare homes run by the Missionaries of Charity, the Catholic congregation established by Mother Teresa, after employees at one shelter were accused of selling babies for adoption.The inspections were announced by the ministry for women and childhood development after a Missionaries of Charity home in Jharkhand state was shut this month following the arrest of a nun and a social worker employed there.Sister Konsalia Balsa and social worker Anima Indwar were accused of having already sold three babies from the home, which provides shelter for pregnant, unmarried women. They were accused of trying to sell a fourth baby, a two-month old boy born in March, for about £1,325. The parents, a couple from Uttar Pradesh state, were told the proposed adoption was legitimate and that the money was for hospital expenses.The Missionaries of Charity, established in 1950 by Mother Teresa – now Saint Teresa of Calcutta – declined to comment on the inspections but earlier said the congregation was appalled by the baby-trafficking claims.“We are completely shocked by what has happened in our home in Ranchi,” a statement from the order said. “It should have never happened. It is against our moral convictions. We are carefully looking into the matter.”Police say Balsa has confessed to her role in the trafficking case but the bishop of Ranchi, the Jharkhand state capital, said this week the confession was extracted under pressure and accused the police of “treating the whole of Mother Teresa’s organisation as a criminal gang”.Political leaders in West Bengal state, where the order is based, have also claimed the case is part of an anti-Christian agenda pushed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, which has a Hindu nationalist ideology.The Missionaries of Charity stopped facilitating adoptions in India in 2015 after government reforms that removed obstacles for single, orced or separated people to adopt children.India has more than 230,000 children in official and unofficial shelters, according to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, but estimates of the number of orphans in the country are as high as 30 million.Despite a waiting list of about 15,000 parents, only 2,671 adoptions took place between the beginning of 2016 and March this year because the process is notoriously slow, requiring a clearance from a court that can take up to four years to be delivered in India’s overburdened legal system. The result is a thriving and lucrative hidden market in babies.Officials admit they do not know the size of the market. In February last year, police in West Bengal arrested the heads of an adoption centre who they accused of selling at least 17 children to couples in Europe, the US and Asia.

He warned that future administrations might use it to stifle religious or rightwing groups.“A variety of opinions should be heard in schools to expose and open children up to different views,” he said.The bill is one of two debated this week in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, that have been criticised as draconian and anti-democratic.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, had hoped to pass another draft law that caused an uproar due to a line in the text that appeared to legalise racially segregated communities, which could allow for Jewish-only towns.It has since been reported that the Nation-State bill, which has not passed but would hold constitution-like status and has been compared to apartheid, has been amended to read that the state will instead “encourage and promote” Jewish settlements.Israel’s government and its parliamentary allies have waged a fierce campaign against domestic and international NGOs that criticise its policies.The Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy has targeted NGOs that work in the occupied Palestinian territories and humanitarian groups. In May, it published a report accusing the EU of providing millions to NGOs that it claimed had “ties to terror and boycotts against Israel”.The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, replied with a terse letter this month to its minister, Gilad Erdan, saying the allegations were “unfounded and unacceptable”.A copy of the letter, seen by the  and dated 5 July, said EU funding is not used to support activities linked to boycotts against Israel and “certainly not to finance terrorism”. To conflate the boycott issue with terrorism, she wrote, creates an “unacceptable confusion in the public eye”.She added: “Vague and unsubstantiated accusations serve only to contribute to disinformation campaigns.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568259.1531846144!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brian o driscoll strikes right note in ni with lambeg drum turn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Duke of Sussex (left) chats to former Leinster and Ireland rugby star Brian O’Driscoll at a summer party in the British ambassador’s Glencairn House  residence during the recent royal visit. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA A visit by former captain of the Irish rugby team Brian O’Driscoll to an Orange march has been praised for “making a difference” to north south relations.The former Irish and British Lions captain visited the Loughgall, Co Armagh, parade and played the Lambeg drum at the July 12th parade.Unionist Senator Ian Marshall characterised O’Driscoll’s attendance at the parade as the “most striking and important” incident last week.The Taoiseach’s nominee had paid tribute to Minister of State Brendan Griffin who attended the Belfast Orange parade and said it was a “huge gesture”.He also said it was of “huge significance” that Tánaiste Simon Coveney had visited Derry after the violence and trouble that erupted there.He also welcomed the presence of Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in Derry “to try and deal with the issues and try and calm and try and calm the situation down”.“And it was a clear indication that actually these gestures as much as some people think them as being just token gestures, they make a difference.”Meanwhile, other Senators called for Sinn Féin to review its policy of abstentionism in the wake of the votes at Westminster when MPs voted by a majority of three for an amendment to a customs Bill, making it unlawful for the North to be part of a separate customs union from the rest of the UK.Fianna Fáil Senator Gerry Horkan said that Sinn Féin might want to attend Westminster on occasion “because if the party’s seven MPs had been present yesterday, the vote could have been overturned”.But Sinn Féin Seanad group leader Rose Conway-Walsh said “the people choose to vote for abstentionist MPs and the people also chose to vote against Brexit. And both mandates need to be respected.”The Mayo Senator said if members of the House felt so strongly about it “they should certainly put themselves before the people and seek a mandate from the people in the North”.She said “Sinn Féin will continue to do everything it can to ensure the rights of Irish citizens in the North are protected and that jobs and enterprises are protected”.But Labour Seanad leader Ivana Bacik said it was “a bit rich” for Sinn Féin to say to say that it will do everything it possibly can to ensure the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland are protected when it will not take up its seats at Westminster”.Sinn Féin’s Máire Devine said Senators should “give it over. It’s a record that needs to stop.”Ms Devine said “Senators should open their ears, go to the North, listen to what people want and not sit here on their cosy fence and decide what they will try to attack Sinn Féin with”.Seanad leader Jerry Buttimer said Sinn Féin changed its abstentionist policy towards the Dáil and “they should take it as a criticism that we now have no voice representing nationalists or moderate unionists in the House of Commons”.Sinn Féin Senator Paul Gavan asked him “why doesn’t Fine Gael end its own policy of abstentionism” and organise in the North?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567114.1531768142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"5 500 year old passage tomb at dowth is find of a lifetime","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Clíodhna Ní  Lionáin, Devenish’s lead archaeologist at the passage tomb site at Dowth Hall, Co Meath. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA 5,500-year-old passage tomb uncovered at Dowth Hall in the heart of the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage site in Co Meath is “the most significant megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years”, archaeologists believe.The ancient burial chamber, believed to be about 40m in diameter and half the size of nearby Newgrange, was discovered during archaeological investigations by the agri-technology company Devenish and UCD school of archaeology.Brú na Bóinne is the area within the bend of the river Boyne that contains one of the world’s most important prehistoric landscapes. Dowth Hall and lands were acquired by Devenish in 2013.To date, two burial chambers have been discovered within the western part of the main passage tomb, over which a large stone cairn was raised.Archaeologists working on the site since May last year say the six kerbstones identified so far would have formed part of a ring of stones that followed the cairn perimeter.One kerbstone is heavily decorated with Neolithic carvings and represents “one of the most impressive discoveries of megalithic art in Ireland for decades”, the archaeologists said.Devenish’s lead architect for the project, Dr Clíodhna Ní Lionáin, said that for the archaeologists involved in the discovery, it was “very exciting” and “truly the find of a lifetime”.She said the the team was working on the theory that the tomb could have been one of the earliest ones constructed in the area. “It’s a bit smaller than the more well-known monuments like Newgrange and Knowth. It’s around half the size of Newgrange but we think it might have been slightly earlier,” she said.“But of course we need to do further investigation and try to find material that we can date fairly precisely to be sure of that theory.”Dr Ní Lionáin said the people who built the tombs would probably have been “the children or grandchildren or great grandchildren of some of the first farmers in Ireland”.“In terms of designing these monuments, they were really good architects, engineers and also astronomers, because we often get alignments on various different solstices. And we can also see from what the art we have here they were amazing artists as well. Even though we don’t know what this art means, everyone who comes here is struck by this art.”Dr Steve Davis, of the UCD school of archaeology, said it was “the most significant” megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years.He said the spate of archaeological discoveries in Brú na Bóinne in recent weeks “highlights what a globally significant place this is”. A number of other significant archaeological sites were discovered at Brú na Bóinne just last Friday during a Government-commissioned aerial survey of the heritage site.A planning application to renovate Dowth Hall, one of the most important protected structures in the Brú na Bóinne area, was lodged by Dr Owen Brennan, executive chairman of Devenish, and his wife, Prof Alice Stanton, in 2016.The 18th-century house on the 430-acre estate will become the Brennan family home and they have said it will also be used as a venue for “stimulating discussion on sustainable agriculture and promoting human and environmental health”.Dr Brennan said Devenish had invested in the farm at Dowth because of its fertile soil, its location beside the Boyne and its beautiful landscape.“It is hugely valuable, and indeed core to our company’s science-based ethos, that we preserve and protect this major heritage site for future generations.”Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan visited the site on Monday and said that “to know that this historic site will be preserved for future generations to see, understand and cherish is positive in every respect”.Dowth Hall and its lands will be open to the public on occasions throughout the year, including during Heritage Week, which runs from August 18th to 26th."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000167700946_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY0XMnE4berkpvWhc-fw2CHnYvmhjopjBo5wANh2lLAw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"turning fan around can help sleep better heatwave","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe unusual method of pointing a fan out of a window can help you keep cool in a heatwave digitalservices@telegraphAs Britain continues to bask in blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine, cryophiles with a penchant for cooler climes have been exchanging tips on how to stay cool during the heatwave.They range from the bizarre, like eating chilli and painting your roof white, to practical tips likes wearing light clothes and keeping your curtains closed during the day.One particularly unconventional method championed by a New Zealand-based eco-warrior involves pointing an electric fan outside of your open bedroom window to keep cool at night.  Nelson Lebo, an eco design adviser for Palmerston North city council in the South Pacific nation’s North Island, explains the clever fan trick works by blowing the warm air stagnating inside your property outwards, while pulling cooler air in.He explained the fan should be set up just after sunset, when the temperature outside becomes cooler than inside your home.Mr Lebo, who is originally from the US, said he learnt the trick from his grandmother who used it in New Jersey during the Seventies.“Everyone knows about cross ventilation,” he told The , “but it only works when the wind is blowing and then it works best when there is a direct route for the wind to blow through a home.“What the fan does is, it forces cross ventilation, even when the wind is not blowing. A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Barack Obama attacks \u0026#39strongman politics\u0026#39, saying world at crossroads between Mandela vision and \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 timesScientists develop early warning system to predict dengue outbreakLet Romanov family rest in peace together, says Princess on 100th anniversary of the murders which shocked the worldParents should not be allowed to opt children out of RE classes, former Education Secretary saysTour de Yorkshire routes could see cyclists banned after angry motorists complain they hog roadsSkills minister: I would advise my own children to \u0026#39leave it a year\u0026#39 before taking T-LevelsMissing Scottish climber found by drone in HimalayasLas Vegas police bodycam footage shows officer fire through windscreen in dramatic car chaseCopper internet cables will be \u0026#39switched off\u0026#39 to improve broadbandSyrians waving white flags turned away from Israeli border as they flee regime offensiveHow popular is Donald Trump?

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers. In Afghanistan, you have no shortage of really interesting issues to cover.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Barack Obama attacks \u0026#39strongman politics\u0026#39, saying world at crossroads between Mandela vision and \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 timesScientists develop early warning system to predict dengue outbreakLet Romanov family rest in peace together, says Princess on 100th anniversary of the murders which shocked the worldParents should not be allowed to opt children out of RE classes, former Education Secretary saysTour de Yorkshire routes could see cyclists banned after angry motorists complain they hog roadsSkills minister: I would advise my own children to \u0026#39leave it a year\u0026#39 before taking T-LevelsMissing Scottish climber found by drone in HimalayasLas Vegas police bodycam footage shows officer fire through windscreen in dramatic car chaseCopper internet cables will be \u0026#39switched off\u0026#39 to improve broadbandSyrians waving white flags turned away from Israeli border as they flee regime offensiveHow popular is Donald Trump?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

Throughout most of prehistory, food gathering and processing appears to have been carried out in order to ensure that food consumption was safe and provided more energy than it cost people to make. It was essentially carried out to produce a net energy gain.But now, archaeologists have discovered the world’s oldest bread – that was cooked and probably eaten in what appears to have been some sort of ultra-early ceremonial or religious complex.The discovery – at an archaeological site known as Shubayqa 1 in what is now desert in northeast Jordan – is particularly significant because wild cereal bread does not produce a net nutritional gain.It would have almost certainly cost the prehistoric people at Shubayqa 1\u0026nbspmore energy to make than they would have gained by consuming it.It is therefore likely that it was among the very first special\u0026nbspfoods to be made not primarily for nutrition – but mainly for cultural and potentially social or ideological reasons.The bread – made 3,500 years before the birth of agriculture –\u0026nbspis from an area and a time associated with the world’s oldest monumental stone buildings (constructed between 15,500 and 14,000 years ago).The buildings – which were not typical of the majority of houses of that era – were probably constructed for communal ceremonies and rituals (perhaps including feasting associated with celebrating or commemorating the dead). The rare stone-built complexes normally have human burials adjacent to or beneath them.The particular building that the bread was discovered in was around eight metres in diameter – and had a well-made stone-paved interior.In the building’s hearth, the archaeologists found evidence of food consumption (given the probable purpose of the building, potentially communal feasting).The food debris includes gazelle, water fowl and hare bones, wild mustard seeds, charred tubers and fragments of at least three different types of unleavened flatbread. It is therefore likely that any special communal meals celebrated there involved feasting on meat and roasted tubers wrapped in or eaten with flat bread in much the same way that people still often consume food in the Middle East and South Asia today.It is also conceivable that this probably ritualised early conception of bread in the Middle East 14,400 years ago represents the genesis of the long-standing religious importance of bread consumption in (or originally associated with) that region.In Judaism, ritually important bread was kept in a portable House of God (a sophisticated tent known as the Tabernacle) before the first great stone temple was built in Jerusalem – and of course special bread is still eaten every Friday evening throughout the Jewish world and a type of unleavened flatbread (called matzo) is still eaten by Jews at Passover.In Catholicism, unleavened communion bread is regarded as part of the body of Jesus – and in Lebanese Arab Christian tradition, a special bread called qurban is still used in ceremonies to commemorate the dead.At least three or four different types of flatbread have been discovered at Shubayqa 1.\u0026nbspA total of 254 fragments were found in the hearth of which 100 were analysed. Of these, only 24 yielded data on their composition. Of that sample, 75 per cent\u0026nbspwere made purely of wild wheat (probably wild Einkorn), 12.5 per cent\u0026nbsppurely from wild barley and 12.5 per cent\u0026nbspfrom a mixture of wild wheat and the tubers of a species of the large bull-rush-like plant, sedge.However, because lots of mustard seeds were also found in the hearth (and it is known from much later Middle Eastern evidence that such seeds were used in bread-making), it is conceivable that some of the other bread fragments at the site were made from wheat (or barley) mixed with mustard seeds.It is likely that barley was the most common wild grass available in the Shubayqa area at that time, and yet the early bread makers at the site appear to have chosen quite deliberately, in the main, to gather wheat. That may be a very significant choice – because wild wheat seeds have much more gluten in them than wild barley and would therefore have made bread dough with a greater degree of plasticity, thus allowing the making of much thinner flatbreads. The bread fragments discovered suggest that they were successfully making flatbreads which were just 5-7 millimetres thick.The entire process of bread-making was (and indeed still sometimes is) nutritionally relatively uneconomic. Harvesting wild cereals, separating the seeds, grinding them, making the dough, flattening the dough and cooking it was an energy and time consuming activity which would not, on consumption, have produced a net energy gain for the people of Shubayqa 1.The Shubayqa discovery may well therefore represent a profound change in human eating practice – away from the purely nutritionally utilitarian and towards a more culturally, socially and perhaps ideologically determined culinary tradition that is the norm throughout most of the world today.The site has been excavated by a team headed by Dr Tobias Richter of the University of Copenhagen. However, the analysis and identification of the bread was carried out by Lara Gonzalez Carretero of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology and Dr Amaia Arranz Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen.The Institute of Archaeology’s Prof Dorian Fuller, a leading expert on prehistoric cereals, said: “This discovery demonstrates that food became something that was valued for more than just calories. It reveals that people over 14,000 years ago had begun to consume food for social, cultural and potentially ideological reasons.”The discovery is also very important because it predates the first agriculture by some 3,500 years. All the cereals being harvested at Shubayqa 14,400 years ago were wild varieties, almost certainly growing in wild stands.The discovery suggests that bread-making probably in the end helped motivate people to start cultivating and domesticating cereals – a development that ultimately led to the birth of agriculture. That is the opposite to what academics had previously thought. Up till now, prehistorians had believed that agriculture led to the invention of bread. The new discovery suggests that the truth is likely to have been the other way round.“The production of a bread-based cuisine was one of the motivations behind people developing agriculture in the Middle East. It is from the Middle East that agriculture and bread spread to Europe and North Africa,” said Professor Fuller.In the 15th millennium BC bread was almost certainly a totally new food, although the relatively rare harvesting of wild cereals for toasting and possible use in porridge form had occurred, perhaps intermittently, since around 23,000 years ago in the Middle East and in China.“Shabayqa 1 is important not just because it has the earliest evidence for bread but also because it has some of the earliest stone buildings in the world,” said the director of the excavation, Dr Tobias Richter, associate professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at Copenhagen University.The discovery of the world’s oldest bread at the Shubayqa 1 site\u0026nbspis being published\u0026nbspin the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u0026nbspThe prehistoric bread discovered at Shubayqa 1 is some 5,000 years older than the previously oldest known bread, also from the Middle East.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But there is a greater mystery at the heart of the idea, too.Though scientists know an incredible amount about that expansion,\u0026nbspand have studied in fascinating detail the rate at which it is happening,\u0026nbspit is still not clear how quickly that expansion is happening. And that is not because we do not know enough – rather because the vast amount we do know does not seem to agree.In fact, as scientists get more precise measurements of that rate, known as the\u0026nbspHubble constant, they become more confused. And recent ultra-precise measurements have suggested that some mysterious, new and undiscovered physics might be at work in the universe.Repeated findings from measurements using technology such as the Hubble Space Telescope have found strange discrepancies in the speed of expansion. Repeated findings have discovered that the universe appears to be expanding faster now than it was just after the big bang.The strange discrepancy looks like a mistake. But it becomes more clear as the results become more precise that it is in fact not a bug but a feature of the universe, as\u0026nbspNobel Laureate Adam Riess\u0026nbsphas put it.The discrepancy – which relies on work done by\u0026nbspLemaître\u0026nbspdecades ago – is something like measuring the height of\u0026nbspa child when it is three years old, then meeting the same child again when it is older and finding that it is far more tall than you would ever expected it to be.A whole host of explanations for this strange effect have been proposed. Almost all of them rely on the 95 per cent of the universe that remains dark and mysterious to us – the parts of the cosmos that we know through theory that are there, but which we have never directly seen.The strange effect could be the consequence of dark energy, which scientists already think is powering the expansion of the universe. It might be that dark energy is pushing galaxies apart with more strength, suggesting that the Hubble constant, so important to\u0026nbspLemaître\u0027s work, is not really a constant at all but changes through time.Or it could be caused by a mysterious\u0026nbspsubatomic particle, travelling through the universe at the speed of light, but which we have not yet seen. Yet another suggestion is that dark matter could interact with normal matter in ways we didn\u0027t understand before.Scientists don\u0027t know which of these is the case – or if the explanation is something else entirely. But it does appear that there is something very strange and as yet undiscovered happening in the universe, acting as it expands.Whatever it is will sheds new light on the expansion of the universe\u0026nbsp– an already stunning discovery when it was first proposed by\u0026nbspLemaître, and one that becomes all the more awe-inspiring as we learn more about it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Scientists expect there are probably around 100 different objects in total.All of the new moons around Jupiter are less than two miles wide. That accounts for why they had been left undiscovered until now, when scientists found them using incredibly sensitive telescopes.The team behind the discovery also found the most distant known object in our solar system – and suggested there might be a mysterious planet, a\u0026nbspPlanet X or Planet Nine, hiding out in the depths of our solar system. The new discovery was made almost by accident as researchers were hunting for more evidence of that world beyond Pluto.“Jupiter just happened to be in the sky near the search fields where we were looking for extremely distant solar system objects, so we were serendipitously able to look for new moons around Jupiter while at the same time looking for planets at the fringes of our solar system,” said Sheppard.Finding how the objects came to be formed and orbit around Jupiter could shed light on the formation of our own solar system. For instance, the new moons are so small that they would be influenced by any gas and dust around the planet – the fact they have managed to survive suggests they formed after the\u0026nbsprotating disk\u0026nbspof gas and dust that surrounded the sun formed into planets.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So much nicer than the aggressive-sounding ‘Allahu Akhbar.’\u0026nbspOr is that just my cultural upbringing?”Richard Dawkins complains people keep thinking he’s Stephen HawkingRichard Dawkins hits back at allegations he is IslamophobicRichard Dawkins asks police to arrest him for blasphemyThe Arabic phrase “Allahu Akbar” is used at the beginning of the “azaan”, or call to prayer, and means “God is greatest.When asked to clarify his comments, Mr Dawkins told The Independent the call to prayer could be\u0026nbsp“very beautiful… but also, ‘Allahu Akhbar’ is the last thing you hear before the suicide bomb goes off”.Some responded to Mr Dawkins’s post by saying his tweet “smacks of intolerance” and calling it “prejudiced”, while one person branded the author of The God Delusion\u0026nbspa “tedious old racist”.“The bells of Winchester sound glorious, as does the call to prayer by a muizzen. The only aggressive, unpleasant sound is this prejudiced tweet as I read the words in my head,” one said.“Turns out The God Delusion\u0026nbspwas just the collective insistence that Richard Dawkins was a philosopher and not just a tedious old racist,” another added.One Twitter user said: “As a number of people said at the time The God Delusion was published, Dawkins’ atheism is intellectually flawed and often simply a vehicle for a suburban conservatism that is run through with a dangerous and aggressive Islamophobia that he passes off as a neutral ‘reason’.”Another tweet said: “Sorry Richard. This smacks of intolerance. You should know better.”Others said Mr Dawkins was ignorant about the Muslim call to prayer and told him to listen to it more closely.“Sir, I don’t think it’s your cultural upbringing. I think you genuinely have no clue what the azaan is or how it sounds. Fine to me if you don’t like it but to qualify this as sounding ‘aggressive’\u0026nbspis just really, really silly,” one said.Another added: “I have the same relationship with it as you have with the ‘Bells of Winchester’ but what you suggested here is ignorant and flat out wrong. As an atheist, you should stop this ironic dance of hate on the lines between religions.”Another said: “As a Christian from a mixed Christian-Muslim country, it *is* your cultural upbringing. And it only sounds aggressive because you never bothered to learn more than English in your life.”Last year, Mr Dawkins defended himself from accusations of “Islamophobia” after a US radio station, KPFA Radio in Berkeley,\u0026nbspcancelled his appearance.In an open letter to the organisers, he insisted he had “never used abusive speech against Islam”.Instead, he said his remarks had been directed at Islamism, a term used to cover both political Islam and Islamic fundamentalism.When asked to respond to critics who accused him of intolerance, Mr Dawkins\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Independent: “Church bells are beautiful. The muezzin’s call to prayer can also be very beautiful if recited in a good voice.“But also, ‘Allahu Akhbar’\u0026nbspis the last thing you hear before the suicide bomb goes off.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

CCTV footage shows the attack and moment he was left for dead.The tragic death that triggered the #JusticeJunior campaign has inspired New York State Senator Luis Sepúlveda and Assemblyman Victor Pichardo to propose Safe Havens for Endangered Children legislations, also called \u0027Junior\u0027s Law\u0027.Speaking alongside some of Junior’s family members outside at a press conference at the bodega where he sought help, Mr Sepulveda said more needed to be done to protect children in danger.We want to make sure that any business owner or their employees who encounter a situation involving a minor who has been abused or may be in danger has a duty to try to help,” he said. Community businesses should be safe havens for our youth. They should promptly notify police.”\u0026nbspHe added that another measure of the bill would ensure that small businesses to have first aid kits on hand “to help those who are injured to save lives”.The proposed bill has the support of Junior’s father Lissandro Guzman, who said in a statement: I feel very content and with all my heart I hope the bill that carries my son\u0027s name gets passed so it can prevent situations like this from happening again and so we can create more security for our beloved children.”If passed, businesses that fails to “provide a safe refuge for a child who had physical injury inflicted upon him or is in imminent danger of such injury until authorities arrive,” would face penalties.In the wake of Junior’s murder much of the anger was directed at the bodega, where he had sought refuge from the gang members. Surveillance footage from inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery store showed the moment he rushed\u0026nbspinto the store and jumped over the counter.Store owner Modesto Cruz said at the time that he tried to help the teen by letting him hide behind the counter, but the gang threatened him.World news in picturesHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

Free\u0026rsquos Will Travers told the country which has become the last great bastion of Africa\u0026rsquos vanishing elephants to \u0026ldquoreject the blood-lust of those who revel in the killing of wild animals.Conservationists fear that Botswana\u0026rsquos elephant herds, numbering up to 230,000 animals, will be targeted by trophy hunters as the country struggles with their mounting crop damage, creating rising tensions among its farming communities.A four-year moratorium on hunting elephants is now being questioned by the country\u0026rsquos politicians and its incumbent president Mokgweetsi Masisi is said to have signalled his support to lifting the hunting ban.Botswana has become a safe haven for elephant herds from neighbouring, strife-torn Angola and Namibia where the animals were used as target practice and their tusks sold for weapons.The Born Free president today urged Botswana to maintain its compassionate conservation agenda and reject the return of hunters.Mr Travers OBE said: \u0026ldquoTrophy hunting is highly controversial and is widely condemned as being inhumane and elitist, failing to deliver either the community or conservation idend that its proponents claim.Botswana\u0026rsquos parliament has now passed a motion to review the ban on elephant hunting                Animal News: More than 100 elephant tusks seized in war on ivory trade                Elephants in the firing line as Botswana moves to lift hunting ban\u0026ldquoBotswana has bravely broken with the \u0027use it or lose it\u0027 mantra of neighbouring countries and has now aligned itself with a more progressive and compassionate conservation agenda that resonates with the great majority of people worldwide.\u0026ldquoBorn Free urges the President and the government of Botswana to resist the siren voices of those who kill iconic animals for fun and who are now on the margins of society.\u0026ldquoBotswana has an opportunity to show independent, resolute, international leadership and to continue on an enlightened conservation course that rejects the blood-lust of those who revel in the killing of wild animals and who deprive the rest of the world of their majesty and wonder.While conservationists say Botswana has around 130,000 elephants \u0026ndash around a third of the entire African population \u0026ndash the Botswana government says the figure are almost twice that number.The human population is estimated at 2.25 million.Legal protection and the presence of a military task force has defended the herds from poachers, while also seeing Botswana enhance its reputation as one the best places to enjoy wildlife safaris.Every day 100 elephants are poached in Africa for their tusksAs elephant numbers increase so has the conflict between the animals and small-scale farmers.Maize crop yields in the Chobe district have plunged by as much as 72 per cent as the herds raid fields.Botswana\u0026rsquos parliament has now passed a motion to review the ban on elephant hunting imposed by former president Ian Khama, introduced in 2014 after surveys warned of declining wildlife populations.Public meetings are being arranged to discuss the controversial issue.Konstantinos Markus, a member of parliament from the wildlife-rich northwestern part of Botswana, explained the impact elephants are having on people\u0026rsquos lives.He said: \u0026ldquoCommunities have become very hostile and negative towards wildlife.\u0026ldquoThis harvest loss leaves the community with fewer options to take care of their households while perceptions of local communities towards wildlife conservation have changed since the hunting ban.Some of the world\u0026rsquos greatest wildlife photographers have come together to give a remarkably candid view of our most cherished and elusive birds and mammals at ease in their remote haunts                    Sam Hobson1 of 12The elusive wolverine has witnessed a sharp drop in numbersMike Chase, a scientist with conservation group Elephants Without Borders explained how reintroducing trophy hunting would have little impact on the elephant numbers or crop destruction.He said: \u0026ldquoHunting occurs in the dry season and targets large bulls, while elephant crop raiding coincides with the rainy season and the perpetrators tend to be young bulls or family herds.\u0026ldquoThe variation in the timing, space use, age and sex of problem elephants suggest hunting will have a limited effect on solving human-elephant conflict.This autumn sees Britain hosting a global summit on wildlife crime with the plight of elephants expected to feature high on the agenda.Every day 100 elephants are poached in Africa for their tusks, with a pound of illegal ivory worth around \u0026pound1,000 on the black markets of the Far East."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Remainers-are-calling-for-Kate-Hoey-to-be-axed-990054.jpg","title":"brexit news kate hoey labour party betrayal

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay.

The first ever officially identified British meteotsunami hit the Cornish coastline in June 2011.British researchers first became aware of the meteotsunami after people walking across St Michaels Mount causeway suddenly found themselves standing in water.Andrew Sibley, of the Met Office, said: The updrafts and downdrafts within a thunderstorm can create small and short-lived pressure changes, leading to initially small sea waves.These waves can then be amplified dramatically by resonance between the speed of the thunderstorm system and the speed of the wave if they are in phase.The speed of the sea wave is related to the sea depth. Such waves can also be funneled by coastal bays, estuaries and inlets.Professor David Tappin of the British Geological Survey added: Most tsunamis are geological, where you have a vertical movement on the seabed which can be caused by an earthquake, like in Japan in 2011, or a landslide.Meteotsunamis, however, are created by weather. You need a small, rapid change in atmospheric pressure of just a few millibars, if you get one of these then it can change the sea surface elevation by a few centimetres.In the deep ocean this would not be noticeable but when it enters shallow water whilst the weather system is moving at the same speed then the sea level increases by several metres."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420905377-e1531774409462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit card is already on the table for theresa may the widely misunderstood wto","story":"In particular, by tying us into EU regulatory standards on goods, it would make it difficult to secure Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including the United States.Nevertheless, you could argue that this minimal Brexit is better than nothing, and some Leavers have. But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

Basel 1A’ is a literary text and is more valuable.She added: We can now say that it’s a medical text that describes the phenomenon of ‘hysterical apnea’, (therefore) we assume that it is either a text from the Roman physician Galen or an unknown commentary of work”.Hysterical apnea, better known today as hysteria suffocation, had been previously mentioned by Galen in other texts.His extraordinary claim theorised that women could suffer hysterical apnea if they stopped having sexual intercourse, an affliction clearly not recognised by modern doctors.Despite this, Galen is remembered as one of greatest scholars of antiquity, particularly in modern medicine.Galen’s belief was very similar to that of Hippocrates, “The Father of Medicine”, who was the first to coin the term hysteria.Hippocrates unusual theory believed that hysteria came from a female uterus that was deprived of moisture, which should have been received through intercourse.He called this condition the wandering womb, which if unhappy as a result of this would float around the upper abdomen triggering “stiff breathing and sharp pains in the heart”, according to the text of his ‘Diseases of Women”.Galen advanced this theory further. Whilst he disagreed that the womb wandered, he believed that the hysteria was caused by the retention of an apparent female seed, which would turn poisonous if not released through regular intercourse.His recommendation to curing this was the hastening of marriage, with the implication that regular sex would cure women of hysteria.This theory has of course been debunked by modern medicine. It was not until Sigmund Freud in the 19th Century determined that hysteria was not exclusive to women but could also affect men, and was determined by upbringing, education and social interaction.In time, the focus on hysteria being a condition determined by sexual intercourse disintegrated within Western society. It was not until 1980 that hysteria was no longer diagnosed as a mental disorder."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421066404.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"londoner moves welsh woodland hobbit house ebay","story":"Kris Harbour owned two properties and enjoyed a bustling social life but decided to quit his job as a lift engineer in the heart of the capital three years ago.The 31-year-old said the daily commute and financial strain of living in London left him feeling tired and unfulfilled.He sold his house and buy-to-let flat to close his £400,000 mortgages and used the money he gained to buy a 18.5 acre plot of land in South Wales he found on eBay.After around 18 months of building the £4,000 building from natural materials, Kris says he is happier than hes ever been.He said: My family thought it was probably a little bit crazy. n the surface of everything I was doing quite well.

No sympathy, I mean he didn\u0027t check something. Distance I\u0027m thinking.\" At this point in our interview, Cruise himself bounds into the room and enthusiastically kisses his co-star on the cheek.Ferguson is suitably surprised, shouting: \"Oh my God! F****** H***\", before laughing it off.However, back in the world of the film, while she admits there was \"a lot of male and testosterone around\", she says that behind the scenes \"there\u0027s a lot of goddamn women which is fantastic\".Ferguson adds that, \"while filming, I never feel like a woman in a man\u0027s world here, I feel like a human being surrounded by other human beings and I think that is what I\u0027m after when it comes to equality\".She said the women in the film add depth of character, not - in her own words - \"just adding boobs to the film\". Simon Pegg, who stars as tech side-kick Benji Dunn to Cruise\u0027s superspy Ethan Hunt, says that working with the Hollywood star can be nail-biting - apart from Cruise\u0027s giggling on set (\"when he goes, he really goes\") .Pegg recalled the previous M:I films, saying: \"It\u0027s always stressful. On this film in particular.\"On Ghost Protocol when he did Burj Khalifa stunt [in the film Cruise scales the world\u0027s tallest building in Dubai] there was a sense of like, \u0027Ooh, this is exciting\u0027.\"And then on the A400 plane that he hung onto in Rogue Nation it was more of a quiet kind of, \u0027Are you sure you want to do this?\u0027\"And on this one, there were multiple times when I flat out just said, \u0027Are you genuinely going to this, because this isn\u0027t entirely safe\u0027.\"And he was just so dedicated to bringing it. And giving the audience the sense of authenticity that you don\u0027t get from films where it\u0027s all done in special effects.\"We just had to lump it. You can\u0027t say no to him. It\u0027s difficult. You try and tell him not to do something and he\u0027ll just do it anyway. He\u0027s a very naughty boy.\"When asked about the MeToo movement, Pegg, who has previously lent his support to the HeForShe gender equality campaign, thinks now is a time for change.\"It happens everywhere and in every facet of industry - marketing, retail, leisure, charity - it\u0027s happening to women, not just to actresses\".\"Yes, we\u0027re going to have to re-educate ourselves in terms of how we interact. Yes we\u0027re going to have to re-define our normalities, but that doesn\u0027t make us the victim. The victims are the women, and that has to be remembered.\"Directing the franchise for a second time, Christopher McQuarrie says he likes to \"create characters for women where they\u0027re not just serving the protagonist\" - a rule he says he carried through his career, right back to the first film he directed (The Way Of The Gun with Juliette Lewis).He also says that as a man who has \"always had respect for equality\" the MeToo movement hasn\u0027t caused him to change anything I his working world.But one thing that did impact the filming schedule was Cruise\u0027s ankle break.\"That was something we weren\u0027t expecting, he said. \"It changed the film in ways we didn\u0027t quite expect, but all for the better.\"Did McQuarrie ever think Cruise may be out for good?\"No, I\u0027ve been through enough things with Tom - there have been other injuries and setbacks - I knew that was going to be fine.\"What we always like to say is, \u0027Disaster is the opportunity to excel\u0027. When something goes wrong in a movie it just forces everyone to come together and be more creative to solve the problem. There\u0027s always a solution.\"And the end result was even bigger than expected: \"This time we focused on character, story and emotion, but I don\u0027t think we knew how big and crazy the film really was until we put it all together.\"One scene, involving Cruise performing a high-altitude low-open (\"halo\") skydive jump from over 25,000ft, took over a month to film.McQuarrie explains: \"The halo sequence is about three minutes long and it took us a month to shoot it.\"\"And then three months of visual effects work on top of that, with hundreds of people working on it, so in terms of screen time, that\u0027s probably the most work that went into any minute of the film.\"And he said that the 55-year-old superstar doing all his own stunts was a mixed blessing.\"It\u0027s great for me, and it\u0027s a challenge for me at the same time. You always have to find ways to put the camera in a place to show that it\u0027s Tom doing it, and that\u0027s always a challenge.\"Henry Cavill, aka Superman, joins the Mission: Impossible cast in the role of August Warren - a CIA agent determined to take down Ethan Hunt at all costs.Despite his own superhero credentials, he was impressed by Cruise.\"All the usual stuff you hear about Tom, charming, professional, always on time, kind. That\u0027s all by-the-by. When I met him, I was like, \u0027Okay, good, this is all true\u0027. What got me was that I\u0027m not easily impressed by people, I\u0027m just not.

Last night the Prime Minister narrowly avoided a defeat by adopting a series of amendments put forward by the hardline Brexiteers. But two of those amendments passed with just three votes as Remainer Tories voted against the Government in anger at the PM\u0027s capitulation to Leave MPs. And Defence Minister Guto Bebb quit his frontbench role to join the Remain rebels. Tuesday\u0027s vote is on the trade bill, which is focused on converting trade deals between the EU and third countries into bilateral deals with Britain. It is a technical bill and was not originally intended to define new trade policy. But it has become the latest battleground for both sides to flex their muscles. And tonight it looks like the Remainers will be in the lead as Tory MPs set to vote against the Government to express their anger at May\u0027s caving in to the Brexiteers. And if Labour decides to vote with with them then Mrs May could be dealt another stinging blow.  Less than two weeks ago the Prime Minister managed to briefly silence critics when she secured a tentative agreement on a Brexit plan at Chequers.   But the unhappy truce quickly unravelled and Brexiteers lined up to criticise the plan which would see the UK maintain the closest possible trade ties with the EU.  Brexit Secretary David Davis dramatically resigned over the PM\u0027s deal followed by Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. Last night Theresa May\u0027s majority was slashed to just three as pro-European Tories protested about the Prime Minister’s concessions by voting against her. The first of those amendments, which would prevent the UK collecting duties for the EU unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements passed with 305 votes in favour, and 302 against.   Theresa May narrowly avoids Commons Brexit humiliation by just 3 votes after caving in to Brexiteers  But it has pleased very few, deepening those divisions in her Conservative Party that have so far hampered progress in talks with the EU, and triggering a bitter war of words between its Brexit-supporting and pro-EU factions. We can\u0027t please everybody. We have to have a compromise position that enables the country to get an agreement with the European Union, trade minister Liam Fox told BBC radio. It\u0027s up now to the EU 27 to determine what sort of relationship they have with us. Tory Remainer Heidi Allen said she wished the prime minister had faced down the amendments.

Even amid the many better-documented battles, moments of tactical ingenuity and individual acts of heroism, Operation Sherwood is astonishing - a high-wire act for the brave men involved that could have resulted in them being captured and executed at any given moment. The plan was terrifying in its simplicity to hide 500 downed bomber pilots under the noses of the Nazis in a forest in occupied Europe - just yards from a German base. But in the circumstances, Operation Sherwood was neccesary. In 1944, as preparations were being made for D-Day, the British Directorate of Military Intelligence Section 9 - aka MI9 - were trying to work out how they could best protect the lives of bomber pilots on the run in France.  A young officer at the British intelligence agency came up with an audacious project to hide them in plain sight - in Freteval Forest, some 100 miles south west of Paris. The Allied airmen would have to survive on meagre rations, have barely any communication with the outside world and they had to live in almost total silence to avoid being discovered. Nobody knew how long they would need to be there but it would likely be months. If it worked they would be liberated after D-Day. However, if it failed, they’d be executed on the spot as spies. The amazing story is told in ‘The Hidden Army’, the first book to be written about the miracle of Operation Sherwood.  It reveals how the mission nearly came to a catastrophic end after only a few weeks when the British and American servicemen hiding in the forest almost came to blows. As tensions rose, the friction between these Transatlantic cousins, who were supposed to be on the same side, threatened to jeopardise the very security of the operation. While the Americans viewed the Brits as lazy, drunken layabouts, the Brits saw the Yanks as arrogant, trouble-making and cocky. Operation Sherwood was the brainchild of Airey Neave, a young MI9 officer and the first Englishman to escape successfully from Colditz.  Once Neave had persuaded his bosses that the plan was achievable he sent two Belgian agents into occupied France to prepare the forest camp. Local Resistance members would provide additional food and offer a level of protection for the men while supplies would be parachuted in by the RAF. Basic tents were put up, straw mattresses laid out, rudimentary table and chairs made and holes dug for toilets. A natural spring would give the men their water supply. On D-Day itself, as Allied forces landed on the Normandy beaches, the first thirty Allied airmen entered the forest camp.  They were soon joined by dozens more, each day bringing a new contingent into the camp. They had been discreetly brought from their Paris hideouts by train, accompanied by guides from the French Resistance, then taken the last few miles across fields or through country lanes. It was a perilous journey but, remarkably, only one American and his female guide was ever caught, and despite interrogation at the hands of the Gestapo they never revealed the existence of the camp. Today, only one veteran of Operation Sherwood is still alive. 94-year-old Ray Worrall remembers it like it was yesterday and is in no doubt how extraordinary the whole plan was. “It’s been described as a miracle,” he says. “I think it probably was.” But the miracle very nearly turned to disaster.  By late-July 1944 there were over 100 British, American, Canadian and Australians already in the forest. But under the summer sun, with rations low, having to sleep five to a tent, only being able to talk in whispers and the constant threat of discovery by the Germans hanging over them, tensions began to rise, particularly between the British and the Americans and the two nationalities threatened to come to blows with the risk the commotion would lead to the discovery of the camp by the Nazis.  To the British, who had been at war longer and suffered accordingly, the Americans were becoming big-headed, cocksure and impossible to live with. “There was a lot of American airmen in the forest,” remembers Worrall, “and they knew better than anyone they were going to win the war. You know how the Americans talk. It was getting peoples’ backs up terribly.” Violent confrontation was becoming a very real possibility, although with little in the form of radio contact, MI9 appeared totally unaware of the situation brewing. Quickly cliques began forming in the camp with the Americans being far from impressed by what they saw of their British colleagues. One of the downed America pilots recalled that “discipline did not seem very good amongst the British and there was a lot of bitching going on.  The ranking British officers tried hard but did not seem able to control their men. A lot of them were drunk every night on calvados or cognac. Nobody did any work if they could help it.” Failed parachute drops didn’t help the situation with rations low and their supply of cigarettes running out also. Cliff Hallett, one of the British aircrew in the forest, remembers the frosty atmosphere well: “The English had had enough of the showing off of their transatlantic cousins. As far as they were concerned everything in America was twice as big, twice as good, twice as nice as in England. They naively stated that in actual fact only they could win the war. They did not want to hear that they had not wanted to know about events in Europe until Pearl Harbour.” With matters coming to a head something had to be done before violence broke out and the camps’ location revealed to the enemy. The man put in charge of the camp, Flight Lieutenant Pete Berry, who before the war was a tobacconist in Piccadilly, had only one option. His decision was to build another camp within the forest solely for American use. It would separate the two nationalities and diffuse the potentially dangerous situation brewing. The Americans were all for it and within days they had moved to another area of the forest and had not only set up camp but had also constructed their own rudimentary golf course in the trees. Over the coming weeks the atmosphere within the forest became bearable again, although the threat of discovery was a constant shadow hanging over the men.

Victoria Derbyshire\u0027s BBC show had political commentator Alex Spence appear to discuss whether Brexit negotiations were being dragged out and taking too long.   Defending the lengthy and complex process of triggering Article 50 , Spence said:   Forty years we\u0027ve been intertwined with the European Union and you’re not going to disentangle that overnight. I always personally thought it would take many many years to sort out. Fair enough. But it was at this point that Victoria made a rather embarrassing blunder.

He continued: And then the actual process by which we have to leave the EU under Article 50, that’s two years and you have to go through that. So, it feels to all of us like it’s taking a long time but it was always going to take this long. Victoria then said: You say \u0027we\u0027. You\u0027re originally from Australia. This forced Spence to respond, rather awkwardly, and say he was actually from New Zealand...  It\u0027s a mistake many of us make.

The drowned village as it is known by locals, has become an attraction for those walking past what once was a vast body of water. With water levels still decreasing, more of the hidden village has potential to emerge. The ruins of a wall can be spotted as the water in Burrator Reservoir, on Dartmoor, Devon dips to just 48.5 per cent capacity. Landmarks including Essworthy Farm, Darke\u0027s leat and Sheepstor Bridge were submerged when the valley was flooded in 1898. Historians are hopeful that with the consistent hot weather they will make an appearance.  Parts of the 15th century Longstone Manor were also sunk when the reservoir was expanded in 1929. According to ghost hunters in the area, on quiet nights the church bells can be heard chiming. This time last year the water source was at about 85 per cent. Locals said it had been fascinating seeing the estate ruins emerge.  Alex Hillman, from Plymouth said: It\u0027s amazing to see all of the things that are not usually revealed. It\u0027s fascinating. I\u0027ve never seen the water this low before. Parts of it we were walking on we’ve never walked on before.

The ban comes despite recent rainfall as the heatwave looks set to continue until at least the end of the month. Water services director Martin Padley said: “Reservoir levels are still lower than we would expect at this time of year. “It is not a decision we have taken lightly.”  United Utilities has seven million customers in the North West. It will apply to all residential customers except in Carlisle and the north Eden Valley, where supplies remain reasonable. Bosses hope it will reduce water usage by 5-10%, or 100 million litres per day. A hosepipe ban also remains in place in Northern Ireland despite significant rainfall on Sunday.  Despite 17mm falling in the vilalge of Portglenone, Co. Antrim within a 24-hour period, daily water usage remains more than 60 million litres (11.3%) above what is normally required during the July holidays. NI Water said: Demand on our plants normally drops over the holiday period to around 530m litres a day, but over July 13 and 14 this year our plants were producing approximately 590m litres each day. There was an initial drop in demand after the hosepipe ban was introduced in June. However, with another warm spell on the way the ban will remain in place for the foreseeable future.  The temporary ban makes it illegal for people to uses hosepipes or sprinklers. It also means people are not allowed to fill paddling or swimming pools, hose their lawn or clean cars, paths or patios with a hose. However, householders are still allowed to use a watering can to water their plants and a bucket and sponge to wash their cars. Thames Water told The Express said that running a hosepipe for an hour would use, on average, the same amount of water used by a family of four in an entire day. Those who breach the hosepipe ban could face a fine of \u0026pound1,000. In an effort to conserve water, people have been asked to use recycled water from bath tubs or from buckets outside which capture any rainfall in their gardens or to wash their cars. As the heat wave continues, people are also being encouraged to have showers rather than baths.  At the end of June, Southern Water asked customers to make sure their showers last no longer than four minutes. As part of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, utility companies can now limit any or all activities for as long as they think necessary. Other water firms in England and Wales say they have no plans to follow suit. Severn Trent Water, which serves the Midlands and mid-Wales, said reservoirs were in a “healthy position”. South Staffs Water, which supplies a million customers in the Midlands, had “no issues”. Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water, Wessex Water, Welsh Water and Thames Water all said reservoir levels were where they should be.

Last week eagle-eyed fashion fans poured over her four fabulous outfits during their whirlwind tour of Ireland. Today they can\u0027t help but admire her pink trench coat dress by House of Nonie. The \u0026pound623 sleeveless dress has captured the attention of many, and not just because she looks gorgeous in it. Meghan\u0027s dress is gaining attention because it\u0027s the latest in a string of blush coloured outfits the Duchess has worn since marrying Prince Harry. In fact, it is the fifth time she\u0027s worn pink.  She has previously worn similar shades to events such as Trooping the Colour, Prince Charles\u0027 70th birthday party, the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards and to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Experts have highlighted the shift in her wardrobe, pointing out how before becoming a Duchess, Meghan opted for darker, bolder colours. However she has noticeably started wearing more neutral, softer tones - and there\u0027s an interesting reason why.   Colour psychologist, Karen Haller, told MailOnline that the colour is calming.  She said: The number of high profile engagements Meghan has had since officially becoming a member of the royal family would no doubt be quite nerve wracking. As the softer end of the pink spectrum is physically soothing, it\u0027s the perfect antidote to calming those nerves and easing the pulse rate.  Karen added that the colour could also reflect Meghan\u0027s feelings for Harry. Soft pinks communicate the nurturing, compassionate, caring side of love, she said. I\u0027m not at all surprised she is feeling this way given the body language between her and Prince Harry - and she is reflecting this in picking the softer pinks.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex looked relaxed and happy together as they met friends and family of the anti-apartheid campaigner today - the day before what would have been his 100th birthday. Among them was Mandela\u0027s grand-daughter Zamaswazi Dlamini-Mandela, who said it was a huge honour to meet the couple, describing them as a shining example for the youth of today and tomorrow. She also praised them for standing by causes putting their name where their mouth is and don’t just talk about it. Meghan was seen chatting with Zamaswazi before her and Harry toured the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition at London\u0027s Southbank Centre and also listened to a performance by the Ubynye Choir, which left the Duchess with goosebumps.  Afterwards Ms Dlamini-Mandela hailed the event as hugely significant in educating the next generation, warning that we must never repeat the mistakes of the past.  Meghan looked effortlessly cool in a blush pink trench dress (\u0026pound620) from House of Nonie - a new number by Canadian ethical brand, which was founded by Nina Kharey in Calgary in 2008.   Meghan teamed it with nude pointed court shoes by Dior and Mulberry\u0027s Clifton shoulder bag (\u0026pound600) in the rosewater hue, which she carried like a clutch bag.  During their visit they spoke to 92-year-old Andrew Mlangeni, who spent 26 years on Robben Island alongside Mandela, who spent 27 years there before his release in 1990.  He said that being faced with the collection of artifacts and pictures “brought back so many memories. Mlangeni had stood on trial accused of sabotage against the then apartheid government in 1938. He praised Harry and Meghan’s visit saying: “To me, it’s an indication of the importance. I am hopeful that we will do more to teach the young generation about the history and especially of our struggle in South Africa, where we come from and where we are at present. This exhibition I think will help in showing the younger people.”  The couple then met Paul and Adelaide Joseph - Anti-Apartheid activists and close friends of Mr Mandela and his wife Winnie Mandela. As they toured the exhibition the couple took a moment to look at a huge pickaxe similar to one that Mandela would have been forced to use when carrying out manual labour at Robben Island - which Prince Harry visited in 2015. They were also seen looking at the Robben Island Bible - which was actually a copy of Shakespeare plays disguised as a Bible.  During the visit they were treated to a special performance by the Ubunye Choir, brought together by the South African Diaspora Ubunye Trust. They also met Thembi Tambo, the South Africa High Commissioner to the UK and daughter of anti-apartheid politician Oliver Tambo, who was a close colleague of Mandela\u0027s. After that their Royal Highnesses listened to speeches by Lord Peter Hain, Chair of The Nelson Mandela Centenary Committee, and Elaine Bedell, Chief Executive of Southbank Centre. Leading former anti-apartheid campaigner Lord Peter told how the Queen had a particularly strong personal relationship with Mandela, when he paid a state visit in 1996. He said: “It was a terrific occasion you could see how close they were, very different from the one last week I might add - but that\u0027s by the way.  And during his 90th birthday party celebrated here in London, Her Majesty the Queen phoned Nelson Mandela in the middle of his party and he was handed the phone and said \u0027Hello Elizabeth, how\u0027s the duke?\u0027 After which his wife Graca Machel scolded him saying \u0027you cannot refer to Her Majesty the Queen on first name terms\u0027 to which he replied \u0027But she calls me Nelson\u0027. Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, who was a guest at the exhibition said: Harry and Meghan are undoubtedly great advocates for important and just causes and you can tell them care passionately about freedoms and justice for all. They are part of an exciting generation of young royals, who demonstrate openness and kindness and are fantastic ambassadors for their family and the country.  Curator Debo Amon, Literature Programmer at the Southbank Centre, said: “It’s wonderful to see it come together. It’s an exhibition that really highlights both his (Mandela) life and the anti apartheid movement. “It shows both the freedom struggle and also speaks to the joint heritage of South Africa and the UK in terms of the anti apartheid movement and what ordinary people did to contribute and help.” They then officially opened the exhibition that will launch two days ahead of Southbank Centre\u0027s Africa Utopia festival which will run from July 19 to 22. After meeting the royal couple today, Mandela\u0027s granddaughter Ms Dlamini-Mandela said: “Today’s event is hugely significant - not only because we are here to celebrate the life of a great man in history, but also because we are able to educate the next generation, that we must never repeat the mistakes of the past.  “The visit of their royal highnesses Harry and Meghan is a great honour. Their support for justice and fairness in the world makes them a shining example for the youth of today and tomorrow. “I hope by being here today they can be huge advocates for the exhibition so that as many people as possible can learn about what my grandfather was about. “The thing I admire most about them is that they are activists and they go out of their way to put their name behind causes that are important to them. “They are young people who want to go out and really make a difference and stand out for certain things that are really important, and highlight certain causes that they are passionate about. “For me, I think it’s very admirable that they stand by causes and they put their name where their mouth is. They don’t just talk about it, you see them actually taking part and we are honoured that this is another one of the amazing projects that they like to support. “They are from a family that has a legacy themselves but by supporting Nelson Mandela’s legacy it will have a huge effect throughout the world.  “Our families have a great history and a shared legacy together and it’s important as us young people to make sure we carry that legacy forward.” Harry and Meghan looked happy and relaxed as they made their way to the Southbank Centre earlier today, where they were welcomed by Lord Peter and Mrs Bedell. Their visit marks the first time the exhibition will be shown in the UK after successful runs in various forms around the world, including six weeks at the Paris Town Hall in 2013. The specially curated films and photography has been heralded for providing a fascinating insight into Mandela’s journey from young anti-apartheid campaigner to becoming the inspiration for an international movement against South Africa’s violent and oppressive system. It is based around six themes - Character, Comrade, Leader, Prisoner, Negotiator, Statesman - all made up of information and photo panels, along with films and archive items from different periods of Mandela\u0027s life.

William Powner bullied, blackmailed and intimidated his nine victims, some as young as 12, so they felt forced to engage in sexual activity and send him pictures and videos of the intimate acts. Powner, of Fitzwaller Road, Woolston, Warrington, was just 13 when he began committing his cyber sex crime.  He was 17 upon his conviction and 18 when he was sentenced today. Powner, who was recently diagnosed with autism and Asperger\u0027s syndrome, avoided an immediate jail term.  He was made the subject of a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order that means his behaviour will be monitored by the authorities, the Liverpool Echo reported.  The sex pest used Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to snare his victims, with police estimating he was in touch with up to 85 separate children, Chester Crown Court heard. Describing some of the abuse, prosecutor Simon Parry said: The suspect [Powner] with his [computer] camera pane deactivated, will tell the victims that he is a female teenager. The suspect will engage in conversation and quickly turn it sexual. Requests are made for exposed chest and face shots, then footage of the victims’ penis and in return and only when this has been done will she return the ‘favour’ and show her face and body. There are many little comments of confidence, flattery and it can be seen that this is being done to ‘hook the victim in’. Once the victim had shown their genitalia or performed a sex act on camera, Mr Parry said, Powner turned nasty.  He would tell his victim the footage was recorded and he knew where they lived, and that if they did not do what he said the footage would be shared with teachers, parents, bullies, and friends. Mr Parry added: In a number of the files, the suspect coerces the victim to stand naked in the room, open their bedroom door and to call their mum up so he can watch it happen. The victims’ body language is completely revealing that he is now acting under extreme duress due to the threats. In another, the victim is made to carry his device downstairs, and whilst still naked, go outside into the back garden. Powner, who had no previous convictions, was also found to have a collection of indecent images of children, with 110 of the most serious Category A movie and photos, 137 in Category B and 73 in Category C.

Popular Charlie Dunne was enjoying a day out at Croyde Bay beach with friends and family - a day after celebrating the end of his A-Level exams and finishing Aylesbury Grammar School. But whilst on the beach, the former Tesco employee, who made headlines earlier this year when he found a rare Cadbury\u0027s Creme Egg, suffered a catastrophic injury and went into cardiac arrest that left him fighting for his life. The 18-year-old, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, was initially airlifted to North Devon District Hospital before being transferred to another in Plymouth. Two days later on the evening of July 11 his parents made the impossible decision to turn his life support off, as  reported yesterday.  A report from the opening of his inquest in Plymouth stated: “Charlie had arrived at Croyde Bay to join his family for a holiday. He quickly changed and joined his sister and family and friends to go bodyboarding. “He was in ankle deep water in a calm sea. He was holding his bodyboard with both hands when he fell. It is not known what caused Charlie to fall. “His sister and a lifeguard went to his aid.” The report added: “There are no suspicious circumstances. A full inquest will be held at a later date to establish the cause of his death.  The day before the tragic incident on July 9, Charlie had been partying with pals at a Leavers\u0027 Ball to mark the end of his exams and finishing Aylesbury Grammar School. He had ambitions to go to university and study the craft of watchmaking. The inquisitive young man and talented rugby player also made headlines earlier this year when he found a rare white Cadbury\u0027s Creme Egg - and bagged \u0026pound200 from it. He was on his way to a night out in Oxford with friends when he stopped the taxi and nipped into a nearby Co-Op for a snack. He told of how he wanted to save the money or \u0027put it towards a party holiday\u0027 to the likes of Magaluf or Ayia Napa before he started uni.  Charlie\u0027s former headmaster, Mark Sturgeon, broke the devastating news to students and parents this week and confirmed counselling is being offered. In a statement Mr Sturgeon said: It is with great sadness that we have to share with you the news that Charlie Dunne, one of our Year 13 students in Denson House, has died after suffering a terrible accident on a beach in North Devon, whilst on holiday. Charlie had recently completed his A levels. He attended the Leavers’ Ball on Sunday 8 July and then travelled to North Devon for a holiday with family and some friends. Whilst on the beach Charlie suffered a terrible accident that left him with a catastrophic injury to his vertebrae causing spinal injury and cardiac arrest. His family took the impossible decision to turn off the life support that had been assisting Charlie since the accident.  Charlie died on Wednesday evening 11 July 2018. Charlie was registered as an organ donor and we know there were three people waiting to receive major organs from him. There is some comfort in him living on in others and potentially transforming their lives. He added: Charlie was lively, inquisitive, friendly and helpful young man. He was always smiling, always happy and was well known across the whole school. His impact on Denson House, on the rugby squad and his friends cannot be underestimated and our thoughts and support are with the family and the whole Aylesburian community.

Pictures show the devastation caused by the searing rays of sun which were magnified on the decorative glass item and set fire to the curtains.  Now a new warning has been issued by firefighters to never leave ornaments in the window during a heatwave .  The fire ripped through the bungalow in Bognor Regis and was so fierce windows and glass ornaments exploded. The terrified OAP raised the alarm by pressing her lifeline button, which alerted the emergency services after spotting the fire while outside pottering in the garden. All of the pensioner\u0027s belongings were destroyed, except the board game Monopoly.  She said: It was the scariest situation that I have ever been in, the fire started and grew so quickly, within minutes the house was full of smoke with glass exploding and smoke everywhere. My whole house is fire and smoke damaged and at the present time, we are unable to live in the property. This week, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service warned others to remove the decorative items off windowsills in the hot weather to prevent another blaze. A spokesman said: On arrival, the crew were faced with a well-developed fire in the front of the property and requested assistance from a further two fire engines.

The shopper complained to the store on Facebook after turning up to the store in Bury, Greater Manchester, on Sunday afternoon and discover it had shut early.  In a post she told Tesco: I am absolutely dumbfounded that such a large chain like Tesco would allow the manager of a large Tesco in Bury to close your branch an hour early on a Sunday because of.....FOOTBALL. The staff on the doors were obviously enjoying turning potential customers away and many were complaining.  She added: We are not all into football and many people work on Sunday and depend on that extra hour that Tesco opens to do their shopping. I can\u0027t imagine how much money you lost today but the manager obviously thought the world cup final was worth it. A very good job the local Asda branch did not have a football fanatic manager. Facebook users flocked to the post to criticise the woman for ratting the branch out. One responded: Snitches get stitches. Another commented: Dumbfounded! Get a grip ya boot. Another added: First World problems. And another said: I\u0027m just glad I don\u0027t bloody work in one! An extra hour for the football isn\u0027t going to kill anyone.

Pet owner Sue Guy-Spratt was in her back garden having a barbecue at the time with her partner, her - children Leo, 12, Jasmine, 11, and Willow, three - as well as some friends. Neighbour Nikki Allen’s daughter Lyla, 10, and a woman who was dropping Lyla home after a playdate witnessed the cat\u0027s death.  The women and two girls knocked on her door while trying to find out who 18-year-old Bonnie belonged to.     Ms Guy-Spratt said: “Nikki asked if I owned a cat and I said I had a dark one so she replied, ‘okay, I don’t think it’s yours’.     “I breathed a sigh of relief but then I added she was a tortoiseshell and the colour drained from her face. She then explained what had happened and my heart broke.”      Mrs Allen told her that the driver had stopped his van in front of Bonnie and then got out of his cab and attempted to shoo her off the road.     The Henley Standard reports that the man didn\u0027t apologise and said: I just thought it was a bit of roadkill.  Ms Guy-Spratt, from Goring, Berkshire, said: “He’d approached her as she was lying down in this boiling hot weather and she wouldn’t have moved because she’d have thought he was going to stroke her.   “I’ve seen several neighbours get very frustrated with Bonnie in the past because she’s pretty stubborn but they would just pick her up and plonk her back into my front garden.”     When the cat refused to budge, the driver got back in the van and drove straight over her, causing severe head injuries.     Bonnie suffered a violent fit before she died beneath a parked car while the driver continued his delivery.    Ms Guy-Spratt said she asked her partner to go and identify Bonnie.  “I just couldn’t cope,” she said. “I stood by the door and watched him walk over, then he looked back and said it was Bonnie.     “I burst into tears and he came back to comfort me. He was pretty upset himself as she had horrific head injuries.”     Her partner went to remonstrate with the driver who was unloading shopping at a neighbour’s house but claims he was met with indifference.    Ms Guy-Spratt said: “He told him the least he could do was come over and apologise.   “By then I was back in the kitchen in pieces and [the driver] walked in with this big smirk on his face, shrugged and said, ‘I just thought it was a bit of roadkill’.     “I just screamed at him to get out of my house and called him a horrible little man.     “He must have watched her fitting while he unpacked the shopping and did absolutely nothing.     “It’s such an utterly vile thing to do and I can’t understand how anyone could be so dismissive of a living being, especially with children watching.”     Ms Guy-Spratt, who had owned Bonnie for 15 years since her former partner bought her from the Oxfordshire Animal Sanctuary at Stadhampton, reported the incident to the police but they said they could not help.     She also contacted the RSPCA, which has said it will investigate.    She said Tesco had apologised and offered her \u0026pound250 for a new pet.  The company also said the driver was being retrained and it would amend its driver training programme to include dealing with animals.

Some of these encounters - such as Robert Mugabe, Bashar al-Assad - have been divisive to say the least. Last week, Her Majesty once again had to shake hands with another controversial figure - Donald Trump. While our famously private Queen has to remain diplomatic and smilingly neutral at all times, she\u0027s still got her own subtle, shady ways of communicating her feelings.  And as Britain\u0027s longest-reigning monarch, she has this down to a fine art - you just have to know where to look for the signs. Luckily, thanks to brains behind Her Majesty\u0027s Jewllery Vault , eagle-eyed twitter user Julie spotted how the Queen (possibly) sent some powerful yet subtle messages to Trump during his visit using her brooches.  And these weren\u0027t I think you\u0027re great, Donny messages, either. No. The Queen of Shade? First, it\u0027s important to to realise the significance of brooches for the Queen. According to Julie, she gets them frequently as gifts and when she chooses to wear one on an official engagement, there is always a significance to the choice of brooch. While this can be a thoughtful or historically significant gesture, it can also be used to show, for example, disdain.  Julie explains: A head of state gives her a brooch? If they visit, she\u0027ll wear it or something else she\u0027d been given by them as a gift. (This goes for other kinds of jewelry too.) To her it\u0027s almost like royal orders. She continues: That said, she wore three brooches while she and Trump were both in town. The day he arrived, the day of the banquet, and the day she actually met him for tea. Possible snub number one? Arrival day was the one that got the most attention. That day, she wore the brooch the Obamas gave her on their last visit to England. Hmm, interesting. Now, this is potentially significant and a snub for the following reasons.   It was purchased out-of-pocket by Michelle and Barack Obama and given to her as a personal gift. According to Julie they chose a very modest pin made of very modest materials. The message is \u0027Here is a gift of something you like, with only sentimental value because it\u0027s for friendship not state visits.\u0027 The Queen has been given jewellery from the US over the years. But she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.  Possible snub number two? The next day the Queen had an audience with the King and Queen of Belgium, for which she chose to wear a brooch gifted to her by Canada.    Julie goes on: You know, who Trump\u0027s been screaming about and insulting. The commonwealth country and one of the UK\u0027s greatest allies. Them. Coincidence? Maybe. But let\u0027s move on to the next brooch. Possible snub number three? On the day of her tea with Trump and Melania, the Queen chose a brooch she inherited from her mother.  Jewel watchers nearly died, because it is the brooch worn in the famous \u0027Three Queens in Mourning\u0027 photo, worn by the Queen Mum, Julie writes. QE rolled up to tea with the Trumps wearing the brooch her mother wore to her father\u0027s STATE FUNERAL. We know the Queen will use her handbag to send subtle messages.

It was good because we had four bedrooms there. \u0027\u0027The children would sleep in double beds and top and tail in bunk beds as well. It was okay and they were comfortable until they got bigger. “Ken was ever so good you know getting the washing up together and I would be downstairs in the kitchen with the children peeling the potatoes for the dinner.”  Daughter Tracey Stokes, 54, said of her upbringing: “We all had jobs to do. Dad would always be ‘one up all up-do your jobs. “Dad would get all the get the children up on Sunday and they would get in the washroom. \u0027\u0027The cleanest children would go in the bath first, so the girls would go in first and the boys afterwards. “There was always moaning from one or the other complaining that they did not want to get in the bath with one of the others because they picked their nose or something.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eerie remains disneys river country","story":"NewsEerie remains of Disney\u0027s River Country water park left abandoned for almost 20 yearsRiver Country was once a haven full of families laughing and splashing about in the sun but has been left to rot for almost 20 years\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMark McConville13:40, 17 JUL 2018Updated13:43, 17 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHaunting images show the abandoned remains of a Disney water park where a child died almost four decades ago. The eerie pictures show what is left of River Country which was the first water park to open at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It was once described as an \u0027old-fashioned swimming hole\u0027 with \u0027a twist of Huckleberry Finn\u0027, but now the murky lake now lies still. Plants have grown over some of the attractions and buildings have begun to crumble. The spooky shots were taken by an urban explorer known as Abandoned Southeast who explained the park\u0027s tragic past.  An 11-year old boy died on August 22, 1980, an after he contracted a rare disease caused by amoeba while swimming on vacation in Disney\u0027s River Country. The disease is found in Florida fresh-water lakes and can enter through the nose, attacking the nervous system and brain. The park was located near Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. It opened on June 20, 1976 and closed in November 2001. The Walt Disney Company announced River Country would remain permanently closed on January 20, 2005.  River Country\u0027s largest attraction, Bay Cove, featured a sandy bottom and unique water filtration system that used confluent water from adjacent Bay Lake. The park\u0027s water was kept at a higher level than the lake, which was an effort to keep out unfiltered lake water, added Abandoned Southeast. Water from Bay Lake was pumped along the lake bottom to a pump system inside a massive artificial mountain. From there, the water was forced down the water slides at over 2,000 gallons per minute, back into the lagoon. This was done to constantly replenish the water supply in the park as well as sweep guests down the slides. In June 1976, River Country\u0027s grand opening attracted more than 700 reporters and their families. In its first year, River Country averaged 4,700 guests per day.

You\u0027ve got to tread the fine line between selling yourself without coming across as a complete wally who\u0027ll be ridiculed by all who swipe (left, alas) on you. In fact, the perfect profile pressure is so high. that there is a wealth of helpful articles dishing out advice . Common pitfalls include mirror selfies, badly cropped-out exes (you\u0027re not fooling anyone, mate) and clich\u0026eacutes like I live life to the fullest. Then there are some less common pitfalls, like TERRIFYING people with some odd requests in your bio... Take Nicole, for example. The 26-year-old registered nurse apparently posted a profile on Tinder saying she was looking for a lifetime partner who is really hardworking, humble, healthy and trustworthy.  Nothing wrong with that. Many of us strive or the same thing. Then it appears she makes some more, erm, niche requests. The lucky man must also have both lungs and kidneys and a heart with a sinus rhythm... Oh, and don\u0027t be a smoker or take any substance that could damage the liver. People were quick to point out there is something a little creepy about the detail Nicole goes in to.

And sometimes it can be just as hard to say no to seconds if that first bowl didn\u0027t quite hit the spot. But a new study shows we actually need to be very careful with certain desserts if we\u0027re planning to drive afterwards, especially if you live in Scotland.  A number of puddings which include alcohol actually contain enough booze to put you over the limit if you have more than one slice, reports the Daily Record .    The research shows two portions of the popular Italian dessert tiramisu - which normally contains two tablespoons of brandy, Tia Maria or Ameretto , sometimes all three - could put you over the limit.  Fans of the coffee-flavoured dessert, translated from Italian as \u0027pick me up\u0027 or \u0027lift me up\u0027, are being warned to stick to one portion or face being hauled over for drink driving. The limit in Scotland is now 22 micrograms in 100ml of breath, compared to 35 micrograms in the rest of the UK. But that\u0027s not the only pudding you need to be careful with. Other desserts on the warning list include trifles, which normally contain about 100ml of cherry brandy (but you\u0027ll need to eat a whole eight-person trifle to get close to the limit) and Christmas pudding which contains an average of 150ml of brandy, sherry, whisky or rum.  But you\u0027ll need to have about five slices of the festive treat to put you in danger. Boozy chocolates filled with alcohol - like Bailey\u0027s mini delights or cherry liquors - can also put you over the limit. But you\u0027d need to scoff 850 to end up with a drink driving conviction, so we imagine you\u0027re probably okay... It\u0027s not just desserts which are a danger, with hot sauce, orange juice, peppercorn sauce and chicken marsala on the \u0027no go list\u0027.

As the eagle was released the unnamed child suddenly ran from the spectator area. Within seconds the bird - with a wingspan of more than 6ft - had grabbed the girl in its claws as it believed she was its prey that it had been trained to catch during the performance.

Wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein snapped the amazing sight as he reveals that last year\u0027s fertile ice harvest has meant an abundance of cubs and healthy adults. It is great news as fears have been mounting that polar bears and other marine \u0026shyspecies could be wiped out within 40 years, according to new research. Climate change is warming the Arctic twice as fast as the rest of the world, meaning there is less ice on which the bears can roam, according to the World Wildlife Foundation .  Inevitably, this is pushing them closer to human settlements to find food, posing threats to the bears and the Arctic communities who live there. But Mr Goldstein revealed this week that he saw an amazing sixty sightings during his June expedition - bringing hope for the world\u0027s 20,000 to 25,000 wild polar bear population. The Wimbledon-based guide said: We even had more cubs than adults. This was remarkable and I have never known it so good.  His stunning photographs sees cubs following their mothers across frozen wastes and a stunning picture of three bears staring into the ice-free waters. Mr Goldstein said he spent a total of six months of his life aboard a Russian ice ship in the Arctic waters of Spitsbergen, guiding for Exodus Travels. Polar bears range across the Arctic Ocean, in parts of Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Norway (Svalbard). They can walk or swim long distances to find food or to breed – sometimes roaming across vast areas up to 600,000 sq km.  He explains: Climate change is having an indelible effect on the ice all over the world. I have seen glaciers retreat more than a kilometre in just twelve years but for once it is refreshing to be able to write something encouraging about bears and ice however fickle it may be in the long run. Each year I guide in this beautiful land of ice and tundra with its 24 hour daylight. It first seduced me at the beginning of the century and has kept an icy grip on me since then, haunting me like only a few other wilderness areas in the world. When guiding the principal attraction is bears, on ice.

Screams and shouts can be heard before passengers are plunged into darkness and run for cover. Moments earlier lava had oozed into the sea and sent molten rock raining through the roof of the boat named \u0027Hot Shot\u0027. The sight-seeing vessel was showered with smaller bits of volcanic debris and cinder from the explosion, which also sent rocks and debris flying towards the 49 passengers. Eyewitness video footage shows a towering cloud of steam and ash billowing into the sky, followed by the glow of red-hot embers and flashes of lightning. It is being described as the worst casualty incident to date from the ongoing eruption of the Kilauea Volcano.  One woman\u0027s leg was broken when the \u0027lava bomb\u0027 landed on the roof of the vessel and smashed into the seating area, said Hawaii County Fire Department Battalion Chief Darwin Okinaka.  The woman, in her 20s, was airlifted to hospital for emergency treatment, family members told Hawaii News Now .  Three other passengers were also taken to a medical centre, while others suffered burns and scrapes, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.  Will Bryan, who was on the boat with his girlfriend Erin, told the BBC : As soon as you saw it coming there was no time to move and the worst part was you\u0027re in a small boat.  So as you\u0027re getting pelted with this lava there is nowhere to go. You only have like 20 feet [6m], and everyone is trying to hide at the same spot. It was actually rather terrifying.  For a little bit afterwards there was just chaos, and the captain tried to do what he could to keep everyone calm but you can\u0027t. Erin\u0027s face was covered in soot and my back was hot. It was just scary. The boat was just off the Big Island of Hawaii on Monday when the fusillade of volcanic lava came crashing down. Authorities said the vessel was operated by Lava Ocean Tours, which charges about $250 (\u0026pound188) a head to watch lava flow into the sea from a tour boat. The incident is being investigated by the U.S Coast Guard and Hawaii County Police.  Video from the scene captures the moment the explosion happens and shows the sky full of black thick smoke before screams are heard and panic ensues. Pictures also show the sheer scale of the damage, including charred debris on seats and the gaping hole in the boat\u0027s roof. Kilauea volcano, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has shown no signs of quieting since it first began erupting on May 3. Lava spewing from Fissure 8 has wiped out scores of homes in Kapoho by the Pacific and filled Kapoho Bay with lava.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time. We are not finished with the recruitment.“We’ve got Adam Barton now and we need definitely one player more in the central defence and also a striker.”Barton signed up on a two-year deal from Partick Thistle, who agreed to cancel his contract and let him head for United as part of the cost-cutting process they’ve implemented in the wake of relegation from the Premiership.That left Csaba delighted to snatch a player from an outfit who could be among his big rivals in the league campaign.“I am very happy that Adam has made the decision to come to us because he is a player who can play in central midfield and also in the centre of the defence.”Meanwhile, United pair James Keatings and Paul McMullan have been linked with moves away.Former club Hamilton are reported to be keen on Keatings, while Partick Thistle are said to want former Celtic wide man McMullan at Firhill.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first part of exhibition opens at art studio opposite dundee va","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first show in a two-part exhibition has opened at an art studio located opposite the V\u0026ampA.Dock Street Studio has launched the first part of Save the Graduate, a collection of fine art created by a hand-picked group of students whose work was displayed at this year’s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design Degree Show.Accolades won by exhibiting artists include RSA Contemporaries selections, The Art Angel Award winner, runner-up in the Edinburgh Sculpture Award and the winner of the coveted Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA) Prize.The self-styled “fashionable alternative to the white-cube gallery” works with the manifesto of “keeping it Dundee”The exhibition aims to be a platform for helping “the poor art graduate” on their way.A spokeswoman for Dock Street Studio said: “For many pieces, it is the first time they will have graced walls outside the art college.“Paintings, sculpture and concepts will all be exhibited and available to purchase.“Remarkable ability, paired with sophisticated execution in an alternate setting, makes for an exhibition that will lead to further Dock Street Studio hype.

When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

which host a number of city centre pubs and clubs can today be revealed as Dundee’s most violent.Police were called out to South Ward Road to deal with assaults more than any other street in the city between 2015 and 2017.A total of 162 incidents were recorded on the street, which is close to a number of nightspots, including 21 serious assaults.On Seagate, there were 142 assaults reported to officers and 93 on Nethergate.Police were also called out to attacks on Hilltown 58 times and Strathmartine Road 53 times.The statistics were revealed after we asked Police Scotland for a list of streets where assaults were most commonly reported over the last three years.South Ward Road, Seagate and Nethergate – all in the city centre – and South Road in Charleston appeared on the list every year.David Glass, president of Dundee Licensed Trade Association, said he believed better policing is helping to keep trouble at bay in venues.There have also been efforts in recent years to make venues safer with information about troublemakers shared through the Duncan pubwatch initiative.Last year, pubs rolled out a “yellow card” system that gives those who cause problems a warning, while “red cards” can see them banned for a year.Mr Glass said: “The yellow card system got people talking about the fact that you can’t go about causing bother.“Every now and then we see police on the beat and we’ve always said that we would be more than happy to see more police out on foot.“Even just them popping in to see how things are helps in the long run.“I realise resources are tight and they can’t have officers out all the time but I think it does seem to be getting managed better.” In the last three years, the number of assaults reported has fallen by 18%.Chief Inspector Nicola Russell of Tayside Division said: “We regularly review analytical data to ensure our resources are deployed in the right place and at the right time.“We have a comprehensive policing plan in place and additional patrols are carried out during times when it is typically busier, including weekends and holidays.“We work closely with our partners and the licensed trade to identify issues at an early stage and to allow us to respond to them appropriately.“Sadly all too often alcohol plays a part in offending behaviour and we know that consuming too much alcohol can lead to people becoming more vulnerable either as a victim or perpetrator of crime.“My message is clear and that is to know your limits and stick to them.”A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “Wherever possible we lend support to Police Scotland on a number of issues.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

principle for a £200 million development of the mall in Aberdeen.Under the plans – which were first tabled in February 2016 – there would be space for 30 new retailers and a 120-bedroom hotel.Bosses had also proposed providing an extra 1,000-space car park, understood to be a multi-storey.However, in their report, planners have limited this to an additional 294 parking spaces, above the existing 1,119, in a bid to prevent problems on the surrounding road network.In approving the application, planners said the application would “promote vitality and viability” in the city centre.Ryan Manson, general manager of Union Square, said: “We are pleased with the council’s decision to approve the application, one which aligns with the aspirations of the Aberdeen City Centre Masterplan (CCMP).“The approval provides a statement of confidence in Aberdeen’s long-term future as a leading retail destination and the potential to continue to offer new and exciting retailers and restaurants alongside expanding our leisure provision within the city.“We look forward to continuing to work with our customers, Aberdeen City Council, and all of our stakeholders.”The extension would be built into the current surface car park and stretch along Market Street.The shopping centre’s floorspace would increase 280m2 to 27,870m2 under the proposals.Hammerson, owners of the site, said in a planning statement from two years ago that the development would see the demolition of part of the existing retail park, to be replaced by an extension to the existing centre.This would house shops, and restaurants, along with providing a number of “leisure uses”.Bosses have said the design is yet to be finalised.Further detailed planning applications are expected to come forward revealing details of the scheme.A public consultation carried out in 2015 on the plans revealed a design around a maritime theme was the preferred option.The centre has been told by planners to carry out improvements to

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”. And colleague, Hugh Hunter, added: “There are exciting times coming up for Maybole and the town has some real opportunities to flourish.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit. It follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies. The game was then followed by a raffle. The three clubs had to choose a charity to donate funds to, with Royal Troon deciding to donate to Ward 3E. Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf. Hopefully by working with Scottish Golf and local clubs we can capitalise on this legacy for many years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"picture-gallery-haddington-show","story":"  From stunt horses to showjumping, face painting and\u0026nbspfree doggy health checks, there was something for all members of the family to join in.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.  Kit, 66, who previously worked as a BBC correspondent, told the Courier he had \u0026ldquohalf an idea for another book but was still considering whether to put pen to paper once again.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

Patrick, a former pupil of Haddington\u0026rsquos Knox Academy, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe all have mental health so it\u0026rsquos something we should be aware of and understand how it can affect others.  \u0026ldquoWe all know family and friends who have suffered from mental health issues, which made us realise that more needs to be done.  \u0026ldquoToo many lives are lost due to people trying to be too strong or they don\u0026rsquot want to admit that they\u0026rsquore struggling due to the stigma attached to mental health problems.  Meanwhile Callum, from Pencaitland, is dedicating the challenge to the late Scott Hutchison, the former Frightened Rabbit frontman who took his own life earlier this year.  He was \u0026ldquodevastated following Scott\u0026rsquos death in May and has vowed to run up Ben Nevis if the group\u0026rsquos fundraising total hits \u0026pound600 before next weekend.  Additionally, the four boys have pledged to get their legs waxed if they hit \u0026pound800.  And Callum said that they had not been doing any additional training before they attempt to take on the 1,345-metre ascent. He said: \u0026ldquoWe haven\u0026rsquot been doing any specific hiking training, just lots of rounds of drilling, rolling and sparring to keep us in tip top shape for the challenge.

Sir John, who campaigned to remain in the European Union, said if Parliament rejected any deal the Prime Minister struck with Brussels it could force another general election.  He also said there was \u0026ldquoundoubtedly a case for a second referendum on Brexit.

He compared some of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg to the right-wing \u0026ldquoTea Party tendency in the US.  \u0026ldquoThere is a bit of a Tea Party grouping within the hardline European Research Group and that makes it very difficult to negotiate with them.  \u0026ldquoIt must be very hard for the Prime Minister to take rather threatening lectures day after day about what they will accept when they are actually a minority in the Conservative parliamentary party.  He said the splits in the Tory Party could allow Jeremy Corbyn to enter Downing Street.  \u0026ldquoI think what they are doing is going to risk a Corbyn government, he said.  \u0026ldquoI think what they are doing is quite likely to lead to a much earlier general election than anybody is anticipating.  \u0026ldquoWhether that\u0026rsquos this autumn or next spring I can\u0026rsquot say but I think the way they are continually chipping away against the unity of the Government and you have people in Government who we are told, through the media, are thinking about whether they should resign or not.  He added that it was an \u0026ldquointolerable position for any prime minister to be in.  Sir John said: \u0026ldquoMy concerns are about those people who are a touch too fanatical about the issue, and are really prepared to go to almost any lengths to ensure that we leave Europe, irrespective of the cost to the country, irrespective of the cost to individuals, irrespective of the cost to the Prime Minister, irrespective of the cost to the party, irrespective of anything but their own fanatical determination to make sure we actually leave Europe.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure how you bring those people back into the fold."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8039624.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"may-goes-down-to-four-vote-defeat-over-post-brexit-medicines-regulation","story":"  The vote, by a margin of 305-301, came amid desperate Government efforts to fend off defeat on a second amendment to its flagship Trade Bill, which would require her to try to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Such was the anger of some pro-EU Conservatives at Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocave-in to the Brexiteers that one, Guto Bebb, the Defence Minister, resigned so that he could oppose the Government. He becomes the 10th person\u0026nbspto resign over Brexit.  In other votes, Labour\u0027s new clause 11, which aimed to establish securing a customs union with the EU as a negotiating objective, was defeated by 316 votes to 289, a majority of 27, and the SNP\u0027s new clause 16, requiring the Scottish Parliament\u0027s consent to implement several powers in the Bill, was defeated by 316 votes to 36, a majority of 280.  Eurosceptic Conservatives had earlier proposed four changes to the UK Government\u0027s Customs Bill aimed at imposing strict conditions on Mrs May after she produced a plan at Chequers that would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food.  Just hours before MPs were due to vote on the amendments to the Taxation[Cross Border Trade] Bill, proposed by the European Research Group[ERG] led by ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, No 10 announced it would not be opposing them, claiming they were \u0026ldquoconsistent with the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  Three of the changes - to maintain the Union and not allow a customs border down the Irish Sea, to take the UK out of the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime and to guarantee there would be no new customs union with the EU without primary legislation at Westminster \u0026ndash seemed to roughly align with the Chequers compromise.  But the fourth - a refusal to collect tariffs on behalf of another country without reciprocity across the continent so that the EU would collect duties on behalf of the UK \u0026ndash did not not least because the EU27 would not agree to giving Britain preferential treatment.  However, No 10 pointed out a section of the White Paper to justify its argument of consistency.  It reads: \u0026ldquoThe UK proposes a tariff revenue formula, taking account of goods destined for the UK entering via the EU and goods destined for the EU entering via the UK.  This, a Downing Street spokesman, made clear the idea of reciprocity was hard-wired into the Chequers Plan.  Yet the paragraph goes on to say: \u0026ldquoHowever, the UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.  During Commons exchanges, Mrs May - in response to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\u0026rsquos claim that she had \u0026ldquocapitulated to the Tory hard Right - was adamant the Brexiteer amendments did not change her Brexit blueprint.  \"He is absolutely wrong\u0026hellipI would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills. They do not change that Chequers agreement, she declared.  But not everyone was convinced. Her Tory colleague Anna Soubry, a leading Remainer, told MPs it seemed Mr Rees-Mogg was now \u0026ldquorunning Britain.  In contrast, Priti Patel, the former International Development Secretary and a prominent Leaver, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the PM\u0026rsquos move was \"constructive\".  Her Brexiteer colleague Peter Bone denounced the Chequers Plan as an \u0026ldquoabsolute shambles and called on his party leader to take it off the table.  Kirsty Blackman for the SNP accused the PM of being \u0026ldquoheld hostage by the Tory Brexiteers and suggested the Conservative Government was riding roughshod over Holyrood\u0026rsquos voice on EU withdrawal.  The Aberdeen MP said while businesses were desperate for clarity over endless Tory confusion, \u0026ldquowe get only in-fighting and a prime minister, who caves in to her extreme hard Brexit wing.  Outside the chamber, one Brexiteer source boasted how Mrs May\u0027s move on the Customs Bill had confirmed \"Chequers is dead on arrival\".  Earlier, the PM faced a call from leading Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, to facilitate a second EU referendum given the parliamentary \u0026ldquodeadlock but No 10 made clear the Government would not agree to such a move \u0026ldquounder any circumstances.  The powerplay over the Customs Bill is just one of several potential flashpoints this week.  After the votes on the Customs Bill, MPs will on Tuesday debate the Trade Bill and the issue of whether Britain should remain in the European single market.  On Wednesday, following the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, MPs will debate Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU and Mrs May will later appear before the Commons Liaison Committee made up of Committee Chairmen.  It is thought David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, will sometime this week make personal resignation statements in the Commons, which will pile more pressure on the PM.  The danger to Mrs May has been underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers have set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by Steve Baker, who last week quit his job as Brexit Minister over the Chequers plan.  It has been suggested more than 100 MPs have joined the group, a number which is more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.  Meanwhile earlier in the day,\u0026nbspScott Mann, the Cornwall MP, became the ninth person to quit their post in protest at the Chequers Plan. The ex-ministerial aide to the Treasury and a former postman, said he would not \"deliver a watered-down Brexit\"."},{"url":null,"title":"from-home-baker-to-the-boss-of-a-biscuit-factory-how-morven-rose-to-the-top-of-the-confectionery-world","story":"  It was the start of a lifelong love of baking which has seen her rise to the very top of the confectionery world after being appointed as the manager of her own biscuit factory.  Morven Burden, 27, from Drumoig in Fife has been handed the keys to a massive plant in Romania that churns out millions of biscuits a year.  It is a far cry from her first homemade attempts as a child, but is the icing on the cake for the Scot who fared better in the kitchen of a five-star hotel in St Andrews where she was a pastry chef during her summer holidays from university.  Ms Burden is in charge of 250 employees and admits that despite graduating with a degree in economics, a career which involved baking was always her preferred option.  Now she produces three million biscuits a year, which is rather more than the desserts she produced for weddings at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel.  She said: \u0026ldquoI used to make what I call pretend biscuits and cakes, which basically saw me go through my mum\u0026rsquos cupboards and grab any ingredients before tossing them altogether and seeing what happened.  \u0026ldquoAlthough they weren\u0026rsquot edible it started something and I\u0026rsquove always wanted to work in baking ever since.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was at university, I wrote to all the hotels asking for a summer job in the kitchen. I would have quite happily just washed dishes, but the chef at the Fairmont said they wanted a pastry chef and that was the start.  \u0026ldquoI was once crowned the Brandy Snap biscuit queen and held a record of making 2,000 by hand in a single shift.  \u0026ldquoI loved it, especially weddings and other big events, and it was a natural step to make when I graduated to go into biscuit production.  After leaving university, Ms Burden started at a McVitie\u0026rsquos factory in Carlisle where popular brands such as custard creams and bourbons are produced in their millions, before she joined the massive plant in Harlseden in London where they produce the famous digestives. Like many others would do if they were in her position she admits that she \u0026ldquosamples her favourite biscuits off the production lines.  But after eating so many of one biscuit, she becomes sick of them and moves on to another brand.  She becomes sick of that one too and them moves along the lines doing the same before a craving for the first one starts again and the sequence begins again.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is very tempting and we do eat the biscuits until we get sick of them but we soon find our appetites again. Everyone\u0026rsquos the same and we\u0026rsquove all been guilty of eating a whole packet of biscuits in one go.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale of how we in the UK love biscuits became clear when I started in London and we were producing something like 100,000 digestives a second, mainly for the British market.  \u0026ldquoI often asked that surely we couldn\u0026rsquot eat that many biscuits, but apparently we can. Every country likes eating biscuits, but they just have different tastes.  Just before Christmas last year, she received a phone call from the head of pladis, the firm that owns McVities, asking her to take over a plant in the Romanian capital of Bucharest.  She is the youngest factory manager at the multi-national at the age of just 27.  But she does not regret the move and is enjoying life in Romania.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe people have been very friendly and have taken to my management style very well as it is very different to what they are used to.  \u0026ldquoMaybe it\u0026rsquos a throwback to the Communist era, but management in Romania is traditionally very regimented and the workers like the fact that I involve them in decision making.  \u0026ldquoIt is a smaller site than I\u0026rsquom used to but we still produce around three million biscuits a year and we have plans to grow the business four-fold.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very different to where I intended to be at this age as I thought that I would automatically go to the McVities factory in Glasgow seeing as I\u0026rsquom a Scot. But I\u0026rsquom glad I\u0026rsquom getting to travel.  To someone who oversees the production of millions of biscuits a year the last thing you would expect her to do when she gets home is eat a biscuit let alone have a favourite.  But she does and unsurprisingly perhaps, her favourite is not one of the better known ones in the market.  She said: \u0026ldquoI like all sorts, most of the kinds that everyone else likes, but I love chocolate gems which are small and filled with chocolate.  \u0026ldquoThey are my absolute favourite. They might not be that well known, but they should be. Mandy Major, the factory manager at pladis\u0026rsquo Aintree site in Liverpool, has acted as a mentor to Ms Burden through her career at the firm.  She said: \u0026ldquoSince joining us as a young graduate, Morven has shown true passion for the business and our sector. She has begun a remarkable career leading complex and varied manufacturing projects across pladis\u0026rsquo sites, and we\u0026rsquore immensely proud that she is taking on this new role in our global family, bringing all her expertise to Romania."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-face-fresh-commons-test-just-hours-after-customs-struggle","story":"  The Prime Minister was hit by a late night ministerial resignation following a\u0026nbsptorrid day of Tory divisions when she \u0026ldquocaved in\u0026nbspto Eurosceptic demands.  Further challenges lay ahead as pro-EU Tory amendments to the Trade Bill go before MPs on Tuesday.  Late on Monday, Mrs May saw off defeat by just three votes on two key changes to the customs bill after a Remainer backlash in the warring party.  Defence minister Guto Bebb voted against the Government, effectively quitting his frontbench role.  He is the tenth in a series of MPs, ranging from star names to minor players, to have quit since the Chequers\u0026rsquo agreement on Brexit, though the first Remainer to go.  Mrs May had earlier bowed to Brexiteer demands to stem a threatened uprising on the bill.  But the string of concessions infuriated Conservative Remainers who refused to back the amendments to the legislation.  Some 14 Tory rebels voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause that would prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless it agreed to do the same.  An amendment that would stop the UK from joining the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime saw\u0026nbsp11 Conservative rebels.  Mrs May inched through with the support of three Labour MPs,\u0026nbspFrank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, on both.  In bruising Commons exchanges, Remainer Anna Soubry accused Mrs May of \u0026ldquocaving in to Eurosceptics.  The Tory former minister told the Commons: \u0026ldquoNobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them.  But as tempers flared, Ms Soubry was told she \u0026ldquoain\u0026rsquot no Margaret Thatcher by Sir Edward Leigh when she invoked the late premier\u0026rsquos support for free trade.

Bosses say they now want to add a new conference centre and extend the exhibition space, warning that \u0026ldquostanding still is not an option in the competitive conference market.  They say they have applied for planning permission in principle and are in funding talks with the city council and Scottish and UK governments over the proposal.  SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said: \u0026ldquoWe believe there\u0026rsquos an opportunity to do something world class with the venue, to be ambitious and to capitalise on an industry that Scotland is already successful in.  A feasibility study looking at the proposals has been carried out.  Mr Duthie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be looking to build an additional 5,000 sq metres of exhibition space, extending our exhibition halls, and effectively build a new conference centre but connected into the existing facilities.  \u0026ldquoOne thing that will do is allow us to stage two events simultaneously of scale.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment, if we have a conference in for the week, pretty much that\u0026rsquos it. We believe the market is big enough that if we had the equivalent facility we could stage two at once and thereby significantly increase the economic benefit.  He said he hopes to have reached \u0026ldquoa meaningful position with regard to securing funding by the end of the year.  \u0026ldquoWe are living in a world where competition in the conference industry worldwide is increasing significantly, Mr Duthie said.  \u0026ldquoStanding still is not an option. Scotland really needs to invest to move forward, but we\u0026rsquore well placed to do that with the facilities we have here, the location of it, the transport links, the increasing hotel provision, which is already being driven through the city, and the team we have here as well.  The plans emerged as Scottish Event Campus Limited revealed a 1% increase in turnover in 2017/18 to \u0026pound29.1million, with operating profit up by 19% to \u0026pound1.3million.  And the development of two nearby hotels is expected to begin this summer, with both due to open next year.  \u0026ldquoThis will increase the number of hotel bedrooms around the campus from 950 to almost 1,400 and will be an invaluable addition to support our growing conference and exhibition sectors as well as our live entertainment offering, Mr Duthie added.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThe SEC continues to be an economic driver for Glasgow and Scotland and the results are measured not only in financial terms but also by the economic impact of the campus which generated net additional expenditure of over \u0026pound1million per day in the Glasgow area, a total of \u0026pound400million for the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-to-vote-on-starting-summer-holiday-early","story":"  But the Prime Minister, whose Government has tabled a motion calling for the current parliamentary session to be cut short, has been accused of \u0026ldquorunning scared amid Brexit turmoil.

It is a portrait of the German artist Max Ernst, who became Ms Carrington\u0027s lover in 1937, and with whom she moved to France the same year.  The painting, from 1939, has been bought for \u0026pound560,000: with \u0026pound100,000 of the total from the galleries, \u0026pound150,000 from the Art Fund and \u0026pound310,000 from the Henry and Sula Walton Fund.  The painting was an important part of the artist\u0027s life.  By December 1942, Carrington, from Lancashire, had become estranged from Ernst, and was about to move to Mexico, where she would spend much of the rest of her life.  She and Ernst met in New York, and as a parting gift she presented him with this portrait.  In exchange he gave her a painting titled Leonora in the Morning Light, which remained in her possession until her death in 2011.  \"We are deeply grateful to the Trustees of the Henry and Sula Walton Fund, and Art Fund, for helping us to make this stunning addition to our collection.  Carrington was born in Chorley, and was the daughter of a wealthy textiles industrialist.  She was twice expelled from school in England, and was sent to Florence and then Paris, where she developed an interest in art.  She returned to Britain in 1935, where her family expected her to marry, but she had other plans for her life.  While studying painting in London, Carrington met Ernst at a dinner party and they fell in love.  When Ernst returned to Paris, Carrington joined him.  Their friends in Paris included the artists Salvador Dal\u0026iacute, Pablo Picasso, Leonor Fini and Joan Mir\u0026oacute, and in 1938 Carrington\u0026rsquos paintings were shown in a major Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts.  In the painting, Ernst is shown in a red robe made of fur or downy feathers, which ends in a fishtail.  In the painting, one of Ernst\u0026rsquos feet is clad in a striped yellow sock.  In his right hand he is holding a green lantern within which is a small horse.  A NGS statement says: \"Carrington refused to interpret or explain her work, her short stories, several of which were published in the late 1930s and 1940s, offer clues.  \"Horses were important in her writing and her paintings, acting as surrogate self-portraits it has been argued that her portrait of Ernst captures some of the ambivalence in their relationship, a sense of being emotionally captive and the need to escape Ernst\u0026rsquos shadow.\"  Following the exchange of paintings in New York, Portrait of Max Ernst subsequently passed into the collection of Pegeen Guggenheim, the daughter of renowned collector and gallerist Peggy Guggenheim.  She gave it to her husband, the British artist Ralph Rumney, and it has been in private collections since."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-thatchers-home-town-bids-for-statue","story":"  Officials in Lincolnshire are developing proposals which could secure a place for the bronze sculpture of the UK\u0026rsquos first female prime minister.  The Public Memorials Appeal has offered the 10.5-foot (3.2-metre) statue to Grantham after failing to secure permission for it to be erected in Parliament Square looking towards the Palace of Westminster.  Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos divisive legacy had prompted police fears of potential vandalism and civil disorder if it was placed in the capital near Parliament.  Westminster City Council advised in January this year that a \u0026ldquomore appropriate design and evidence of support from the Thatcher family may be considered more favourably, amid reports Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos daughter Carol was unhappy with its lack of a trademark handbag.  Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), which runs the Grantham Museum, and South Kesteven District Council (SKDC) are working with the Public Memorials Appeal to draft outline terms of an agreement.  Formal proposals are expected to be submitted to the council before the end of the year, allowing councillors to consider the application.  The statue, by Douglas Jennings, was funded by private cash and reported to cost \u0026pound300,000.  It is\u0026nbspplaced on a 10.5ft plinth \u0026ndash bringing its total height to 21ft (6.4m).  Mrs Thatcher, latterly Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, grew up in the Lincolnshire town and was the daughter of a grocer.  An SKDC spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe understand from reports that there has been some debate about whether the statue should have represented Lady Thatcher in her years as Prime Minister and even whether she should have had a handbag.  \u0026ldquoThere is no debate, however, about the likeness or the sheer quality of the statue.  \u0026ldquoWe have not heard this officially from the family. If the statue does come to Grantham, we would, of course, be inviting representatives from the family to join us at its unveiling.  A Public Memorials Appeal spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to offer the statue to Grantham on behalf of the people that have donated towards its creation, both here in Grantham and via the Public Memorials Appeal.  \u0026ldquoIt is a stunning statue and I think it would be absolutely fitting for it to come to Grantham. I very much hope we can make it happen.  Grantham\u0026rsquos bid for the statue follows a previous campaign for the Iron Lady to be honoured in her home town, which included designs of her holding her famous handbag."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-caledonian-university-chaplain-holds-mass-for-gross-offence-of-pride","story":"  Father Mark Morris, of Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, last night invited parishioners to a rosary of reparation.  According the Balornock church\u0027s website, the service was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \u0026ldquocelebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.  But last night Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University, held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTI event.  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \u0026ldquoThis was a private parish devotion unrelated\u0026nbspto Father\u0026nbspMorris\u0026rsquos role as chaplain.  Jordan added: \"We are concerned about the message that this could send to the young people of Glasgow Caledonian University, and so would like to stress that these predictable voices of opposition are becoming increasingly drowned out by a Catholic and wider faith community which is supportive of LGBT equality.  \"There were many people of faith who attended the Parade this weekend and in our efforts to advance LGBT-inclusive education in schools, we have been strongly supported by numerous Catholic Priests and their parishioners, as well as Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church ministers.  \"Our experience working with the Scottish Catholic Education Service as part of the Scottish Government\u0027s LGBT Inclusive Education Working Group has also been nothing but positive and productive.  \"We know that those who support the LGBT community outweigh those who endorse intolerance and I imagine that the number of attendees to this service in contrast with those who attended the Pride parade would further prove that.\"  Glasgow Caledonian University and the Catholic Church in Glasgow have been contacted for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-unemployed-scots-has-increased-official-figures-show","story":"  Official figures show 120,000 were out of work between March and May \u0026ndash up from 115,000 in the previous quarter.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Water levels as low as 1976 on River Thurso","story":"WATER levels on the River Thurso have been at their lowest in decades during the recent dry spell, according river expert Eddie McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who retired as river superintendent in 2016, has manned the river for 37 years and says that the dry weather of the past few weeks has resulted in water levels comparable to those in the 1976 heatwave.Levels in 1984 were similarly low.One or two anglers have travelled up for pre-booked fishing trips only to change their plans after seeing the low water.However, overall this has had minimal impact on the river angling business, according Mr McCarthy.\u0026ldquoThe anglers are usually quite hardy, he said. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll take their golf clubs up or will go trout fishing.Despite the rain returning on Monday, Mr McCarthy is unsure when the water levels will return to normal. \u0026ldquoWe need 72 hours of proper rain for it to rise.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 17, 2018 at 4:31 pmAs children across Scotland enjoy their summer holidays, NHS 24 is offering help to parents, grandparents and carers to keep the family safe and healthy, whether at home or abroad.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770095.1531850404!/image/image.jpg","title":"major north sea oil project to last into late 2030s","story":"        One of the North Sea\u0026#8217s most complex developments will continue to produce oil and gas for another 20 years, operators have said.                The Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) is made up of multiple fields sharing a central processing facility.            It opened 20 years ago and is now expected to operate into the mid to late 2030s under as a “poster child” of the Oil \u0026amp Gas Authority’s maximising economic recovery strategy.            At the time of exploration, the individual areas were not deemed to be commercially viable alone, so the ETAP alliance was formed to develop the fields as one joint development.The project intially involved seven fields, four operated by BP and three by Shell, all funnelled through the central processing facility. Two further BP-operated fields came online in 2002 while two of the Shell fields have since ceased production.Day-to-day production operations of the remaining seven ETAP fields are controlled by BP from the central processing facility, with more than 550 million barrels of oil equivalent produced over its two decades.BP North Sea regional president Ariel Flores said: “ETAP embodies the pioneering and innovative spirit the North Sea is renowned for around the world and shows what can be achieved when companies work together for the greater good of the region.“When the project was sanctioned in the mid-1990s, BP and our ETAP joint venture partners were applauded for our unique collaboration and high level of innovation. Here we are 20 years later, continuing to push boundaries in maximising recovery and extending field-life.            “ETAP remains a key asset in BP’s refreshed North Sea portfolio and our enduring North Sea presence.”Dr Andy Samuel, chief executive of the Oil and Gas Authority, added: “ETAP stands out as one of the great maximising economic recovery strategy (MER UK) stories - a ‘poster child’ for MER UK, even before the concept existed.“Most impressive has been the great leadership and collaboration from the owners, investing significantly over decades to unlock substantial value in innovative partnership with service companies.“The area still has an exciting future, with plenty to play for and the potential for further discoveries to be tied back.”            Mary Church, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “Instead of desperately trying to squeeze out the last drops of North Sea oil, climate change ‘poster child’ BP should be taking a long hard look at what the consequences of its pursuit of ever more fossil fuels means for the next 20 years.“Like its fellow oil majors, BP has known about the dangers of climate change for many years, but continued to pump oil and gas like there’s no tomorrow, putting profits before people and planet.“We’ve already passed 1C of warming, and the climate science is clear that we absolutely have to move away from fossil fuels if we want to avoid truly catastrophic warming. That means planning a transition away from oil and gas that is fair to the workers and communities currently dependent on jobs in that sector.“It means directing investment towards the low carbon economy and ensuring that good quality jobs are created here in Scotland as we move away from fossil fuels.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4742452.1531823265!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 40 of scots back snp s claim of westminster power grab","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer.

prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 17 Jul 2018 7:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years.

The opportunities afforded to a new generation of Gaelic speakers are thanks to people like Duncan MacQuarrie who had the sheer determination, vision and love for the language to persevere. \u0026#8220Today, the education, employment and cultural opportunities enable Gaelic speakers to live and work in their preferred language in a way that would not have been possible without Mr MacQuarrie\u0026#8217s efforts.\u0026#8221\nPlans for the next phase of the affordable housing site \u0026#8211 which will soon be submitted for full planning consents \u0026#8211 will be delivered through a creative partnership involving Sabhal Mòr Ostaig the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, the Highland Council and the private sector and will see the creation of up to 31 units of housing on the site.\nThe units will comprise a range of models and types of tenure, including rent to buy, self-build, housing for the elderly and, affordable for-rent housing. All tenures come with a rural housing burden attached to title, thereby retaining the housing stock in perpetuity for the benefit of those committed to living and working in the local area.\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

It has created uncertainty and trepidation in sections of our community and for others an anticipation of constitutional change. \n\"So even without a specific timeframe, it is becoming apparent to a growing cross-section of opinion that partition is running out of road.\" \n\nThe Derry man also said all sections of society should be preparing for such constitutional change. \n\"A refusal to discuss or engage in preparations for such seismic change would be a wilful dereliction of duty and risks a return to the bad old days. \n\"The outworking of these dynamics, however, need not be a threat. in reality the reinforce the imperative for political engagement and dialogue.

failed to receive support from Fine Gael. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile described the vote as a “momentous step” towards officially banning the import of goods from illegal settlements. \n“These goods and services are only available due to war crimes carried out by the Israeli state by completely disregarding the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n“Palestinians are forced from their homes, schools are destroyed and people are displaced on a daily basis to make way for the construction of these settlements,” he said. \nSinn Féin joined demonstrators from the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign outside Leinster House yesterday to extend their solidarity to the Palestinian people ahead of voting in the chamber. \nWelcoming the historic vote Chairperson of IPSC and Palestinian-Irish citizen, Fatin Al Tamimi thanked Senators who supported the historic Bill and encouraged Senators to continue their support until the the Bill reaches the final stage. \nMs Tamimi said: “We in the IPSC and we Palestinians around the world warmly welcome this historic vote, the first its kind in any Western country. \n“Once again, Ireland is making history and leading the way in its solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she continued. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27415  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted.

One person said the most social person in the world will be reduced to a zombie-like state for days – it’s the personality equaliser, everyone becomes boring.\n  \nRemoving the drugs from our streets is welcome, removing a dealer is more welcome, removing the people at the top of the criminal gangs poisoning our children will represent a real success.\n  \nWhile the drug is here and being used there needs to be proper support for those who having become addicted need medical and community support to break that addiction.”\n  \nXanax produces its calming effects by suppressing the inhibitory receptors in the brain and central nervous system to decrease the abnormal excitement in the brain that leads to anxiety symptoms.\n  \nKnown on the street as “bars,” “planks,” or “zanies,” Xanax abuse is ever-increasing.\n  \nSome individuals combine Xanax with other downer drugs like opiates or alcohol in order to increase the pleasurable feelings.\n  \nThis can lead to negative health consequences such as respiratory arrest, coma and death. \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_856489.jpg--.jpg?1531308362000\n","title":"january date for wright freedom","story":"  \nMid and East Antrim Borough Council will confer the Honorary Freedom of the Borough on Sir William Wright CBE next January.\n  \nEarlier this year elected members agreed on the prestigious award in recognition of Wrightbus founder Sir William’s contribution to global business and the local economy, and his service to Mid and East Antrim.\n  \nIt followed a motion proposed by then Mayor Councillor Paul Reid and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.\n  \nSir William met with current Mayor Councillor Lindsay Millar and Council Chief Executive Anne Donaghy recently to plan the official conferment ceremony.\n  \nThe Mayor said: “At this week’s meeting of full council it was agreed the conferment ceremony will take place on Friday 18 January 2019 in The Braid in Ballymena.\n  \n“Sir William’s vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”\n  \nChief Executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Anne Donaghy said: “Sir William has provided employment to tens of thousands of our citizens over the years, showcased our area around the world, promoted and supported the education of our young people and provided a lifeline for many organisations and groups within Mid and East Antrim.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_854130.jpg--.jpg?1531216060000\n","title":"new braid housing project targeted by international property developers","story":"  \nA unique housing development in Broughshane, Co Antrim is attracting interest from international buyers. \n  \nAntrim-based construction company Loft Estates is in the process of completing work on its award winning Copper Barns development, which sits on a 4.5 acre rural site overlooking Slemish Mountain and the Braid Valley. \n  \nThe \u0026pound1.3m investment in three state-of-the-art homes, was part funded by Danske Bank.

So far, we’ve sold two homes to legal professionals from London and there have been enquiries from around the world about the third and final property on the development.\n  \nHe added: “The homes are entirely bespoke and whilst they are very contemporary in design, the overall concept works because they relate back to the original stone barns they replaced. We have one barn remaining and will start this in conjunction with the new buyer so they can be involved in customising it to suit their own individual requirements.”\n  \nCommenting on Danske Bank’s support of the project, Mr Dinsmore said: “Danske Bank have supported a number of our projects in the past and we value the personal relationship we have with our Relationship Manager. We operate a number of businesses and a pension fund and Danske Bank really took the time to understand our quite varied needs across this portfolio, so it was an easy decision to switch.”\n  \nMichelle Wilson, Business Banking Manager at Danske Bank, commented: “The Copper Barns development is the latest project from Connor and his team and as ever they continue to innovate and excite.
