Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/18/09/0693FF60000003E8-7260117-Victims_top_row_left_to_right_Elaine_McIver_43_Saffie_Roussos_8_-m-57_1563438293124.jpg","title":"Lady Orchadleigh House admits pinch unbelievable home","story":"Share this article She had heard a lot about the new Lord of the Manor, and at a party on the estate in the summer of 2015, she finally met him.‘I was bowled over,’ she recalls. ‘Who could fail to be? Chris is so full of life and fun. We realised we had so much in common. Most of all, I was stunned that a stranger could love Orchardleigh as much as I did.’Two weeks later — after a first dinner date at nearby Charlton House Hotel — she finally walked through the grand wooden doors of Orchardleigh House and was able to explore inside the house she had loved so much from the outside.‘The scale and size of the rooms blew me away,’ she said. ‘I loved the extravagant details — the parquet floors, the stained glass windows, the plasterwork shells above the doors and the staircase that seemed to go on for ever.’Heather rapidly found herself being sucked into helping Chris. ‘I needed a feminine touch with the furnishings,’ he admits cheerfully.Their relationship proceeded at breakneck speed. ‘I knew I was head over heels with him within the week,’ says Heather.          Some of Chris’s additions are a little unorthodox. In the middle of the exquisite parquet floor in the morning room, in place of the Duckworths’ hand-woven Turkish rug, lies a square of decidedly utilitarian industrial-strength carpet. The pair are pictured together above‘We share the same sense of humour, the same philosophy of life. I love his kindness, his fairness and the way he treats everyone equally.‘In January 2017 he took me off on his yacht for four months. We sailed 1,600 miles from Cannes to the Canary Islands. It was wildly romantic but also deeply testing — you really get to know someone on a small boat. From then on we were inseparable.’On New Year’s Eve the couple got engaged and they were married in the little chapel on the estate on August 19 this year. After their honeymoon in Devon, Heather moved into Orchardleigh House with her children.‘The kids love it — they have known the house since they were babies and are wildly excited,’ she says.With its numerous buildings, including the remains of a 15th-century castle, Orchardleigh can host two weddings simultaneously and Chris employs a staff of 80, including six groundsmen. ‘Our next project is to offer three-day wedding events, starting in the castle and moving on to the house, then our newly restored Palladian-style boathouse,’ he says.Some of Chris’s additions are a little unorthodox. In the middle of the exquisite parquet floor in the morning room, in place of the Duckworths’ hand-woven Turkish rug, lies a square of decidedly utilitarian industrial-strength carpet.         Orchardleigh House fell into disrepair after developers who planned to turn it into a luxury hotel resort went bust. After the entire contents had been auctioned off by Sothebys for £3.5 million, English Heritage put the mansion, by that time a shell, on its ‘at risk’ register. Then in early 1999, ebullient entrepreneur Chris Vincent roared down the drive in his Bentley and fell instantly in loveAs for the ‘lost’ artworks that once hung in Orchardleigh, Chris has simply had them copied by drawing on Sotheby’s auction records. He has also added other ‘masterpieces’ for good measure. There are lurid versions of everything from Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus to a painting of a galloping Napoleon.But his determination to be true to the fabric of the house is impressive. No walls have been removed or added and the kitchen, where caterers now prepare food for wedding banquets, has the original Victorian range and steam-driven plate warmer.In the flagstoned hallway hangs the line of 33 bells the Duckworths used to summon staff. Labels include ‘Mr Duckworth’s Business Room’ and, rather perplexingly, ‘Bachelor’s Bedroom West’.‘English Heritage tell me they are the best array of bells in the country,’ Chris says proudly.As she adapts to her new role, Heather takes comfort in the family’s motto, inscribed on one of Orchardleigh’s oriel windows: non nobis solum (not only for ourselves).‘The Duckworths might very well be surprised to see me in their house,’ she says with a smile. ‘But I hope they’d be pleased. After all, I’ve always loved the house every bit as much as they did.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Jeffrey Epsteins ex cellmate says never touched him","story":"Share this article \u0027The staff here at MCC had hundreds of inmates to choose from yet I was their first choice,\u0027 he said. He is in jail for allegedly killing four people in a drug deal gone wrong in Otisville, a town in upstate New York.

first used on the BMW 7 Series in 2001 - becoming ever more affordable, the manual method is likely to be phased out entirely over the next few years.The CarGurus study found that only 30 per cent of new models now have handbrakes, down from 37 per cent in 2018.CarGurus UK editor Chris Knapman confirmed that the handbrake is heading for extinction..He said: \u0027It\u0027s official, the death of the handbrake is coming as manufacturers switch to electronic parking brakes in huge numbers.\u0027They have rapidly gone from being a novelty to what our research shows is now the norm.\u0027Within the next few years we expect the number of cars on sale with traditional handbrakes to decline further, likely only to be found on a select number of niche models.\u0027These systems might lack the tactile feel that some drivers value from a traditional manual parking brake but they bring several benefits in terms of convenience, safety and packaging.\u0027An electronic parking brake can engage automatically when a car\u0027s engine is switched off and many also include an auto-hold function that will apply the parking brake when a car is stopped in traffic or on a hill.\u0027Electronic parking brakes are also easier to install than their manual equivalents and replacing a handbrake lever with a simple button frees up more space in a car\u0027s interior – useful perhaps for an extra cup holder or two!\u0027But he added that the trend for electronic devices might take some of the fun out of driving for new motorists.He said: \u0027Of course, the benefits can\u0027t be ignored but as the latest technology trickles through manufacturer line-ups, many new drivers might never experience one of the most familiar of automotive features.\u0027The temptation to attempt flamboyant handbrake turns is soon to be a thing of the past too!\u0027Earlier this week, it emerged that some of the world\u0027s biggest makers of self-driving cars want US regulators to remove the requirement for steering wheels, pedals and mirrors.Companies including Honda, Uber, Waymo and Lyft, which are developing autonomous cars, want the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recognise self-driving cars as a separate vehicle class to address the rules. "},{"url":null,"title":"Family OxyContin used Swiss bank accounts conceal transfers","story":"Share this articleNew York Uncovers $1 Billion in Sackler Family Wire Transfers -

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15.

He felt a “deep sense of remorse” at helping bring the man who would become president gain wider attention. Andrew O’Hagan famously detailed the extraordinary details of ghosting Julian Assange’s memoir, including watching the WikiLeaks founder eat jam pudding with his hands, before the latter backed out of a £600,000 book deal. This week, the writer Natalie Beach joined the grand tradition of ghostwriters speaking out about their subjects, with a deeply intimate essay in the Cut laying out how she used to ghost everything for her former friend and controversial “influencer” Caroline Calloway: from Instagram captions to the aborted book that once attracted a $375,000 (£300,000) publishing deal, until their relationship broke down irretrievably.Beach’s account says that after the pair put the book proposal together, the influencer felt unable to write it. Beach says she “bought us time with the publishers by writing a quarter of the manuscript by myself”.With Calloway now obsessively responding on Instagram to Beach’s essay, and as the internet picks over the details of the story – you can find out if you’re more of a Caroline or a Natalie in the inevitable Buzzfeed quiz – the bestselling ghostwriter Andrew Crofts ponders if it had all been planned.“Is it a car crash, or have they achieved exactly what they want to achieve?” he asks. “It’s all very Tom RipleyDickie Greenleaf. That’s what’s intriguing.”As a ghostwriter himself, Crofts questions the ethics of speaking out about his subjects’ lives. “I do think Tony Schwartz shouldn’t have come out and said anything about Trump, because you’ve taken the money. It’s like a lawyer: if you find that the person you’re representing is a murderer you can’t then go around bewailing the fact you defended them – that was your job,” he said. “But I think he made Trump, I don’t think Trump would be president if he hadn’t written that book for him, because he’d never have got The Apprentice without the book, and the presidency without The Apprentice. So it must be weighing heavily on his conscience.”With more than 80 books behind him, a dozen of which were No 1 bestsellers, Crofts can only recall having to sever ties with one subject himself. “He was an elderly gentleman, and I remember him coming out of the shower naked,” he says. “He had all the photographs for the book spread out on the floor and they were sticking to his feet, and I thought: ‘It’s time to go.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

The British ships were no longer carrying fine muslins and calico to Europe. The primary produce brought over was jute, cotton, the sorts of materials used in the emerging British industrial project.”Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches at the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said that Britain’s history of commercial shipping was “a deeply violent one, which included shipping millions of black and indentured bodies tightly packed in the holds of ships to be exploited on plantations.”“It is shameful to not acknowledge this in favour of a diffuse and dishonest pride,” Gopal said.“It is a reflection of the pervasive ignorance that goes hand in hand with Empire nostalgia” Wagner said.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The slave trade was an abhorrent practice for which the British government has rightly apologised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948ad0a2ebe6d931d8827ea89ac184986af76c1b/0_22_1313_788/master/1313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306caf54e16c85fc1d3f595eb7213881","title":"reclaimed lakes and giant airports how mexico city might have looked","story":"The Mexican capital was founded by Aztecs on an island in a vast lake. No wonder water flows through so many of its unbuilt projectsEver since Mexico City was founded on an island in the lake of Texcoco its inhabitants have dreamed of water: containing it, draining it and now retaining it.Nezahualcoyotl, the illustrious lord of Texcoco, made his name constructing a dyke shielding Mexico City’s Aztec predecessor city of Tenochtitlan from flooding. The gravest threat to Mexico City’s existence came from a five-year flood starting in 1629, almost causing the city to be abandoned. Ironically now its surrounding lake system has been drained, the greatest threat to the city’s existence is probably the rapid decline of its overstressed aquifers.No wonder water flows through many of Mexico’s City’s unbuilt projects.The first plan to eliminate the city’s lakes while preserving canals and reservoirs for transport and irrigation was proposed by council member Francisco Gudiel in the 16th century. Gudiel’s vision was nixed by a city council unwilling to contribute the necessary funds. The lakes remained for a couple more centuries, disappearing just when the car came on the scene in the early 20th century. When they were finally drained no water was left for irrigation or transport and the city became a rapidly expanding maze of concrete, swamped with motor traffic.A ring road surrounding a grid of streets has been a central vision for Mexico City since the first modern urban development plan by Carlos Contreras in 1933. One proposal in this vein from Mexico’s ministry of works in 1967 would have heavily impacted the city’s urban landscape with a double ring road surrounding the city’s historic centre, one clockwise and one counterclockwise. Areas such as the Tepito and Merced neighbourhoods would have been filled with high-rise social housing for 80,000 people and high-value commerce. The plan disappeared silently when Mexico was engulfed by student protests in 1968.A 1970 project from the ministry of works, called Aztlan 2000, envisioned the construction of a social housing complex for 1.5 million inhabitants in the city’s northern periphery to accommodate the masses of new migrants coming to the booming megalopolis. The plan integrated housing, malls, a racetrack, hospitals, a zoo, a golf course, a stadium, a subway and a museum, among other amenities. None of these were built and the population of the city’s peripheries rocketed from 591,000 in 1960 to 7.3 million in 1990, largely driven by informal growth.A 2009 project that might have addressed the dearth of services in Mexico City’s periphery was a cross-shaped annex to the prestigious Rufino Tamayo museum for the Atizapan district by Mexican architect Michel Rojkind and Denmark’s Bjarke Ingels Group. The municipality never transferred the land required for the project.The most sweeping proposal to return Mexico City to its lake-based origins came from Futuro Desarrollo Urbano, a group of high-profile Mexican architects headed by Alberto Kalach. Their long-running Ciudad Futura proposal called for the construction of a new urban development in the area of the old lake of Texcoco. Treated wastewater was to be used to flood approximately 12,000 hectares of former lakebed. A new city would then be built on the banks of the lake with islands linked to the shore by causeways. The project was intended to kickstart the urban development of Mexico City’s impoverished eastern districts with the creation of 80km of lakefront.Kalach’s project hinged on financing generated by the construction of an airport but when different Mexican governments undertook to build airports in 2001 and 2015 Futuro Desarrollo Urbano’s participation was not considered. Both times the airport projects were cancelled, the first because of fierce resistance from local campesinos and the second because of a change in government, cost over-runs and environmental concerns.The grid of wide avenues called ejes has been an important source of urban blight, with traffic racing past depressed shops and disjointed housing. Another project from Romero proposed a partial solution by creatinga cultural corridor, commercial corridor and High Line-style park over Chapultepec Avenue. The 2015 proposal sparked accusations of gentrification and commercialisation, and the plans were cancelled after a referendum called by the city government.As well as the disappearance of Mexico City’s lakes, many rivers and creeks have gone too, culverted and concreted over to reduce flooding and create space for more roads. A 2016 project by Elias Cattán of architectural bureau Taller 13 aimed to reinstate the Rio de la Piedad, which currently lies under one of the city’s main inner ring roads, Viaducto. Cattan’s plan envisioned putting the freeway in a tunnel under the river, and building a linear park on the banks of the resurrected stream.While the Rio de la Piedad project has failed to find backing, the newly elected mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, has recently announced her intention to start recovering some of the city’s waterways.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ffaa8132510dca1da6be46990384efa4878f79/0_76_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461d83089fec81e6f0282f8e6747728f","title":"integration racism assimilation britain heritage","story":"Assimilation is an invidious concept. No one in Britain should have to give up their heritage to fit inI will never forget the day I joined an English Defence League march in Chelmsford, Essex, in the run-up to the Brexit vote. I went as a journalist, and I wasn’t expecting it to be a comfortable experience. But the most shocking moment was not what I predicted. Instead of threatening me with directly racist slurs, a senior figure at the march told me he wasn’t fussed by my presence. “You’re OK,” he said. “You speak English properly. You know our ways. You’re like us. It’s the others we have a problem with.”By “others”, he meant Muslims – the EDL’s most frequent target – or any other visible minorities he deemed to have made insufficient effort to assimilate into British culture. It struck me as the most chilling and insidious form of racism of all: he was, in effect, saying, “People who come to England are acceptable to the extent they attempt to mimic us.” Underpinning that is a confidence in one culture’s inherent superiority over others. It’s for exactly this reason that it is becoming more widely recognised that assimilationist thinking – the idea that a particular culture is preferable, and that others should therefore adopt it – is a racist ideology. “Integration is not assimilation,” said the UK’s most senior counterterrorism officer, Neil Basu, this week. Basu was pointing out that the latest research on terrorism shows that people with extremist views are moved to violence not because they aren’t “assimilated” but because they feel excluded. “Create a sense of belonging, while not forcing people to give up things they may hold as sacred,” Basu rightly recommended. “If we fail … we risk social exclusion turning to violence.” But too many people who profess their support for integration are really talking about assimilation.The pressure to downplay your culture, your identity or your pride in your heritage to gain the approval of the majority around you risks further excluding people. Yet it is a pressure many of us recognise. Earlier this week I hosted a public conversation with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, where we talked of our common experience in embracing mispronunciations of our names to make lives easier. His “Sad-eeq” is really meant to be pronounced “Saad-iq”. My “Afua” is really meant to be pronounced “Ef-wa”. We have both embraced a version others in this society find less onerous to grasp.Khan himself is clear on the difference between assimilation and integration. He sees integration as about encouraging meaningful interactions not just between people of different ethnicities, but also different ages, social classes, sexual orientations and abilities.This is something all governments should take more seriously. But the question is, how much can be done against a backdrop of cuts to the kinds of cultural activities and community services that have naturally facilitated integration for decades?The 2016 London mayoral campaign was a case study in how deliberately promoting segregation and ision can still be a mainstream political tactic. Khan’s Conservative challenger, Zac Goldsmith, ran a campaign that even other Tories acknowledge was isive and racist in its attempts to spread distrust of Khan because of his Pakistani heritage. It was the idea of his strategist, Lynton Crosby. Yet at the very moment Khan was being inaugurated as mayor, Crosby was being knighted in David Cameron’s honours list.It may be naive to hope for a more sophisticated discourse on integration when we have a prime minister who is comfortable with using racist and degrading language. But the root causes that motivated some people to vote for Brexit – feelings of social exclusion, of not being at home in one’s community, of rising levels of inequality and of feeling left behind – are reminders that creating a cohesive society is not an optional luxury. And if we fall into the trap of old-fashioned assimilationist thinking, we will continue to create more problems than we solve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ea760134695ab6dd3166563bcf5d5157a57f516/0_131_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8143fa294aee552ae667f4ebeb4c7029","title":"tories duty free government no deal advertising booze","story":"Now wanted north of the border for a prorogation scam, prime minister Boris Johnson went on the run this week with a series of alarming public appearances. Tuesday found him in a primary school, as per the timeworn political practice of ministers using inappropriate venues as backdrops. You know the sort of thing: “It’s great to come to this wonderful early years centre and announce 10 new active nuclear warheads, each capable of snuffing out 300,000 human futures in an instant.”Wow. Look, I know Prime Ministers Say the Darnedest Things. But maybe the best way to stop no deal is to put a call in to Oxford and explain they need to retroactively award Johnson a first-class degree? Just claim there was a marking error or something. Having read the Yellowhammer documents forecasting shortages, pretty much any gambit is justifiable at this point in the interests of public safety. Giving the prime minister a belated first would just be the classics department version of a cop shouting at Raoul Moat: “It’s fine, mate! I know you didn’t mean to hurt her! Nobody’s going back to prison. Just put the gun down and we can talk.”And so to another week in getting everything you always wanted. Johnson began with a horror show in the House of Commons, where his election offer to Jeremy Corbyn amounts to “Give me another series, you shit.” At least by glowering on the front bench and shaking his jowls and shouting, “Oh yes!” at Corbyn, Boris Johnson finally resembled Churchill. Unfortunately, the insurance dog version.He ended the week even more clumsily, after some Downing Street genius let it be known that the DUP had shifted their red lines in a way that could lead to a deal. Have they? Not according to adorable DUP leader Arlene Foster, who denied it and declared ominously: “Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories”, which sounds like the sort of coded message you might rasp down a telephone with a hanky over the receiver. Fair warning’s fair warning. As for whoever briefed this story, it’s all very well being the third hardest spad in No 10, and I’m sure Arlene will take your Call of Duty score into account when discussing the leak. But babe: you’re not really in the same weight ision as the DUP guys, even if you did both wear combat trousers in the 1990s.Others suspect that what will really be on offer when parliament returns is Meaningful Vote 4 – set to displace Jaws IV: The Revenge as the worst fourth iteration of a franchise ever. The latter at least gave us one of the great Michael Caine quotes. “I have never seen it,” said its leading man. “By all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.”Keen to build something other than resentment himself, Johnson spent the rest of the week promising a hardware bonanza. As always when he runs out of road, he suggested a bridge, followed by a promise to “bring shipbuilding home” with five new frigates. Maybe he could send a frigate round to the courts to stop domestic violence survivors being cross-examined by their abusers? Because thanks to his rogue prorogue, the domestic abuse bill is now back to square one. The only upside to suspending parliament has been the social damage done to Jacob Rees-Mogg. Not two months ago, that appalling old Hyacinth Bucket swept into office issuing naff decrees on the minutiae of how to address envelopes. He has now committed the somewhat greater faux pas of bullshitting the Queen.That this is all set against a backdrop of an advertising blitz gives the UK the feel of a Paul Verhoeven satire set in the near dystopian future. There’s “GET READY FOR BREXIT”. There’s “BE ONE OF THE 20,000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS”. But my favourite is the Treasury campaign, where animated booze glasses trilled the news that: “Beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes will all be duty free for people travelling to the EU if we leave without a deal.” You might be reminded of those Conservative ads a few years back, which said the government was “cutting the bingo tax and beer duty, to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy”. Those ads had their critics, but I admire the consistency and the realism, as the Conservatives continue to promote the notion that alcoholism and gambling addiction represent the smart choices for anyone governed by them.In fact, these government-backed reminders to drink early and often fuel the same sense of deep optimism as that moment in the Chernobyl drama when the new recruit to the dogshooting unit turns up to the camp and sees endless stacked pallets of empty vodka bottles. When any government – Soviet or modern British – is pushing cheap booze on you, you’ve got to think you’ve landed on your feet. Haven’t you?The alternative view, I suppose, is that government-advised inebriation and respiratory disease feels the next logical step of the Brexit shambles. “Prorogation” and “justiciability” and “stymying” and “fiat” – no one’s really sure precisely what these words mean, other than they weren’t in the brochure for the sunlit uplands. Still, don’t put your hand up and ask questions. Just accept we’ve been billeted in the irradiated uplands, gripped by a strong sense that the instruction book to our country has been lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f031af1d46783398e43b55b704f570bf5c2fec6/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b8d3e724fad44918c9805759f5fdc34 1290w","title":"i dont know how we come back from this australias big dry sucks life from once proud towns","story":" Australia reports from three communities hard hit by one of the worst droughts in living memoryby  Anne Davies,  Ben Smee and  Lorena AllamThe crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the mass fish kills along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water.Residents of three distinct areas talked to  Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive.It seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that’s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW.It’s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows.This is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown.Dubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions.But tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six.That means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council’s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day – half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C.“There are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,” says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. “At the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.”A fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 5050 bore and dam water by March.But there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong.“I’m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won’t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,” says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray.She points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points.Bill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times.“There isn’t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,” he says.McMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted.Astoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. “They can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.”In the meantime some of the city’s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further.The zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing “browse” feed for animals.The zoo’s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling.“We hold 50ML on site at any one time,” he says. “The water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.”The zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it.“We can not only reuse the water and get a longer life, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,” Hinks says.“Even if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold.“We are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don’t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here. We are working closely with Water NSW and council about options such as sinking bores on site, and desalination and sewage treatment and recycling.”The further you travel from Dubbo, the more acute the problems are. Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people.Such excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong.“Having this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,” says Nyngan’s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse. It holds about 700ML, which is close to a year’s water for the town, particularly with water restrictions. But it depends on water from Burrendong, brought by the 66km Albert Priest channel.Further west along the road to Bourke, the situation is already dire.Girilambone, population 26, is already part of the way towards becoming a ghost town but this drought could be the last straw. The town water supply ran out six months ago and water is now trucked in every two days.The rail line to Bourke closed in 1986 and, since then, the town has been in retreat. The station is derelict. The hotel burned down. The general store and petrol station closed two years ago. “There’s not much laughter here in the pub these days. The farmers try to come in to buy two beers but then they have to go.“Ah, but it will be all right. We’ve got through this before.”After 73 days it rained a trickle in the southern Queensland town of Warwick in August.Few locals celebrated the end of the longest dry spell in living memory. The drought had passed the point where 5mm in the rain gauge could make a drop of difference.“Warwick is a fantastic town, a very proud town, but it’s on its knees,” says Ian Macdonald, who runs a local garden nursery with his son, Brent. “I don’t know how we ever come back from this. Because if it rained tonight, it doesn’t rain money and we’re about a quarter of a million dollars down the gurgler.”Warwick is on track to run out of water within months. Roadside signs heading into town remind residents of the new restrictions: 100 litres per person, per day.Locals take pride in their rose gardens – shopping centres and hotels and Chinese restaurants are named after Warwick’s signature flower. Each year in October the Rose and Rodeo festival is the town’s showpiece event.“We can’t afford the money to bring in roses this year because no one is buying and you’d quite easily do your arse taking a gamble,” Macdonald says. “What people don’t get about a drought is that it hurts everybody … If the farmers have got no money, none of us have got any money ... People don’t buy plants to take home. They don’t stop after the cattle sales and buy a pie at the pie shop.” In Stanthorpe, 60km to the south, “day zero” – when drinking water supply runs dry – is approaching just as quickly. The towns in Queensland’s Southern Downs and Granite Belt are hubs for primary producers mostly fruit and vegetable growers. Last month the Granite Belt Growers Association estimated the reduction in wages and expenditure would cost the local economy $100m.Ann Bourke from Jester Hill Wines – a spokeswoman for the Granite Belt Wine Tourism body – says the latest vintage was picked a month earlier than usual, and most local winemakers now have business plans that assume they will lose one harvest in every five.“It’s costing us $2,000 a week to buy in water,” Bourke says. “We’re still in two minds, do we throw the dollars at buying more water and have a vintage, or do we concentrate on just keeping the vines alive?”Some of the bigger farms have decided not to plant this year, which means there is no additional work, and few backpackers in town.“That means there’s less people employed, families might move away, next year our school numbers will drop,” says Amanda Harold, the secretary of the Stanthorpe chamber of commerce. “It’s very scary and very stressful for everyone.” Harold says Stanthorpe faced a similar situation 10 years ago, when the community was months away from running out of water. She, like many locals, thinks authorities should have acted more quickly to build the Emu Swamp dam. The dam tends to split opinion, but most accuse successive councils and governments of failing to plan properly.Rick Humphreys, a small producer, decided not to grow his primary crop – parsley – this year. He says there’s an increased acceptance that climate change will force farmers to adapt their practices.“I think people now acknowledge that we’re in uncharted territory,” says Humphreys, who is a member of the group Farmers for Climate Action. “A lot of the old blokes, whose families have been keeping records a long way back, they say this is the worst drought on record …“If the numbers are right a version of this is going to become the new normal in the mid-term and we need to think differently about how we produce things and what we produce. The worst thing we can do is carry on farming ... the way we always have.”Macdonald says he was called “a communist” by a local Warwick identity for suggesting the weather patterns had changed and that October thunderstorms were no longer a regular occurrence.The far western town of Walgett will be back on bore water again next week.Rain in March sent the last natural flow down the once-mighty Barwon River, and the quality of what remains has been declining ever since.On 3 September the shire council warned locals to boil water for drinking and food preparation owing to “high turbidity” – a level of murkiness that can indicate the presence of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli.Locals say the water coming out of the tap is brown, brackish and smells bad.“It’s yucky water,” says Clem Dodd, from the Dhariwaa elders group. “It stinks. You can’t wash in it or wash your clothes in it, or they’ll stink too.”Walgett shire’s general manager, Greg Ingham, agrees the situation is “pretty dire”. “I really do feel for the community about the river,” he says. “It’s sad to go down and see what was a thriving lifeblood of our community just a dry, parched riverbed.”Walgett’s bore water is high in sodium, which can pose a risk for people with heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions. The water supply is regularly independently tested, and the NSW health department has said it is safe but the taste can be unpalatable.Ingham says the shire is in discussions with the state government to install a desalination system but that in itself will not solve the town’s water woes.“The output of any desalination treatment won’t be the same as what is currently going through our treatment plant. Desalination on its own won’t be enough to supply all our needs. We might have to look at a blend of the two.”For the past year locals have been buying bottled water or receiving crowdfunded donations shipped in by truck and car.When Walgett’s only supermarket burnt down after an electrical fault in June, locals had to make an 80-minute round trip to Coonamble to buy water, or go further afield. A temporary shop opened in August.“We’ve had various campaigns,” Ingham said. “We’ve had a lot of bottled water coming in, through GoFundMe pages. Then we had a concern about all those small empty bottles piling up here, not being great for the environment.“Now 20- to 50-litre-sized containers are being delivered to households. But the bottom line is we’re no different to any other part of regional Australia suffering through the drought. The only real long-term solution is rain.”The Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and the Dhariwaa elders group have been distributing bottled water, and delivering water to housebound elders.“Buying water is expensive,” says a local Gamilaraay woman, Vanessa Hickey, “having to spend extra, to wash fruit and veggies.”Both she and Dodd have started to think about what the lack of water might mean for the future. Dodd says moving away is a possibility but Hickey says she’s not going anywhere.“They’ve already ruined our rivers with cotton, coal seam gas and mining. But I’m not moving. The community suffers from other people’s wrongdoing. It’s not our fault but we’re the ones who suffer the most.“They want us gone because they want the land they want what’s under the land. But where can we live in the city? We only live in the country. I’d rather live in a tent on the riverbank – only we’ve got no river to live on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d7be25577f8da4dee563e385c4333bc8871bd9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62929d1c1fdfbdb9b9e2f886d5400bb0","title":"canvas of lies what dominic cummings dress sense tells us about brexit","story":"From his quilted gilet and tote bags to his crumpled shirts and hoodie, Cummings’ look is as chaotic and misguided as the no deal Brexit he is determined to realiseDominic Cummings might be best known for being found in contempt of parliament and masterminding its prorogation. But his most egregious act is possibly wearing – day-in, day-out – a gilet.French for vest, this item of clothing would seem to be the extremely Europhobic Cummings’ sartorial bread and butter. He is rarely seen not wearing one – or without the minutes for a covert plan to undermine democracy.Cummings’ style has caught the eye of politicos, which some dismiss as a trivial matter. But in the political arena, image matters. Margaret Thatcher’s 80s power suits were scrutinised David Cameron’s switching of his parting was national news (Cameron later nominated his barber for an MBE) and eyebrows were raised at Theresa May’s favourite and incongruous Frida Kahlo bracelet.With Cummings, analysis of his clothing also acts as a knowledge gap-filler, because the man seemingly running the country is an enigma. We must mine each aspect of his character for clues as to what’s next. Sure, Cummings has a blog (now dormant) – and I’m not going to say it doesn’t have some clever ideas – but it also reads as though he went to a lot of evening classes at Alain de Botton’s The School of Life.In the 19th century, a gilet was more frequently an embroidered waistcoat and closer to a jerkin (a close-fitting open vest popular in the 16th century). Nowadays, it is a versatile garment: a sporty, padded body-warmer made popular by snowboarders a reversible combination of suede and shearling for late-morning coffees or school runs or the rabbit fur that Sienna Miller teamed with Ugg boots and every single festival between 2002 and 2004, AKA the era of boho.Cummings reminds me of Brain from Steven Spielberg’s Pinky and the Brain. This isn’t based on the fact he is bald. Many people are bald. It is because of the lightbulb shape of his skull, his pointy ears and popping eyes, and the fact that his ambition is the same as Brain’s: taking over the world.Very occasionally, Brain wears a suit when plotting. In 2001, when he was campaign director at Business for Sterling, Cummings wore a suit. Floppy but thinning hair, hands jauntily in his pockets – and in another shot, a cigarette languidly between his fingers – the vibe is very “author photograph on the inside jacket of a self-published novel”.The shirt is open-necked. It has stayed open-necked since, but these days Cummings wears his shirts with more heavage (male cleavage) on show. His signature twist is to rock a collar with one side tucked and the other not, embracing the asymmetrical trend exemplified by the much talked about Ksenia Schnaider jeans. At least Cummings’ shirts are mostly white, which, I used to think, was a classic staple difficult to get wrong. Except it is unclear whether Cummings owns an iron (perhaps too much a signifier of rich remainers). Mostly, he wears his shirts spilling over his jeans, apart from when he once tucked it in with a brown belt, which did not do its job, revealing the evil genius’s black boxers in a look more commonly seen in a drill video than on the steps of No 10.When going casual, Cummings favours shapeless T-shirts in block colours with obscure logos. You might think nothing much can be gleaned from Cummings’ old tees, except one of these logos looks a little like a wigwam emitting a signal. Further research reveals that it is the logo of Sci Foo camp, described as an “unconference” for emerging technology and scientific ideas. Unconference. Classic Dom. (The camps are held annually at the Googleplex in California.) Take his shoes off and this could be a Steve Hilton look.Also: tote bags. Cummings loves a tote. He carries around a Vote Leave-branded one in the manner of someone who went to Daunt, once. It’s from 2016, of course, this canvas of lies, which means it could probably be sold as vintage for £30 in a Hackney pop-up. He has also been spotted with a tote-with-a-quote: “It was nine-thirty on Christmas Eve …” The opening line of Susan Hill’s Woman in Black a 1983 Gothic-inspired horror novel. Gothic-inspired horror doesn’t seem too far away from where we currently are.Other accessories include a pen behind the ear black square-framed glasses (think Colin Firth in Tom Ford’s A Single Man) and an ever-present lanyard, presumably holding the parliamentary pass he should never have been granted.Perhaps the gilet jokes have become a little too much for Cummings, however, who this week was spotted in a departure piece: a grey Levi’s hoodie. This is a 90s skateboarder staple or an ex-boyfriend’s garment that is frequently worn by women around the house or for casual Sunday roasts, drawstrings pulled tight. Of course, Cummings made it weird by shoulder-robing it.Is this new wardrobe addition a sign that the often implosive, sweary Cummings (spotted recently stalking the halls of the palace with a red wine) will take a more casual approach to his career? Almost certainly not, as the country struggles through an apparently endless constitutional crisis or heads to a general election. We await with baited breath the clues to come from further tote and tee logos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/407a0622f39c15ec4c11d0f0b37203de38e3a120/0_196_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=914eef6e47d899c402673219c86c6647 3800w","title":"100 best films movies of the 21st century","story":"Gangsters, superheroes, schoolkids, lovers, slaves, peasants, techies, Tenenbaums and freefalling astronauts – they’re all here in our countdown of cinema’s best movies since 2000by  Peter Bradshaw,  Cath Clarke,  Andrew Pulver and  Catherine ShoardQuentin Tarantino’s latest jaw-dropper bumps Kill Bill: Vol 1 off the list in gloriously irreverent fashion.

AP Read the reviewIntense, anger-driven documentary from Ava DuVernay on the racialisation of the US’s justice system, positing the idea that the massively disproportionate incarceration of African-American men is simply slavery by another name. With a title referring to the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery, DuVernay suggests that privatised prisons, cheap labour and light-touch capitalism are all in it together. Tough stuff. AP Read the reviewA knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don’t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It’s the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra Hüller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie. CC Read the reviewPossibly the most fun anyone’s had at the cinema so far this century, Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street ought to be a cautionary tale. It’s based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in 1999 for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the reviewThe film whose Palme d’Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema.

Depending on your tastes, a candidate for sexiest film of the century. CC Read the reviewAt the age of 47, after a career directing TV soaps such as Casualty and EastEnders, Joanna Hogg reinvented herself as auteur of a new breed of cinema. In her feature debut, Unrelated, Kathryn Worth played a fortyish woman holidaying in Tuscany with two dysfunctional families and flirting outrageously with one of the lads (Tom Hiddleston in his first movie). A cinema of awkwardness, wielding a scalpel on the well-to-do middle classes, was born. CC Read the reviewKelly Reichardt is a master of slow cinema, the maker of films about American outsiders, living without a safety net. Meek’s Cutoff is a western set in 1840s Oregon, following three families on the wagon train west. Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt’s focus, as is customary for her, is on the women – a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the reviewHere’s a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan – the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It’s set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it’s a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the reviewLars von Trier’s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur’s masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier’s use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the reviewThe film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a orce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi’s desperately painful family drama. Farhadi’s superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences. CC Read the reviewBritish director Andrew Haigh’s quietly devastating drama is a deeply moving portrait of marriage with the shiver of a ghost story. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay play a Norfolk couple planning their 45th wedding anniversary. A week before the party, a letter lands on their doormat like a hand grenade with news of his early lost love. Rampling is sensational. CC Read the reviewThe Dardenne brothers’ second Palme d’Or was bestowed on this stark portrait of underclass desperation, filmed in their characteristic hyper-naturalist manner. Jérémie Renier plays a petty criminal who sells his newborn baby in the adoption black market, but his devastated girlfriend’s response forces a kind of redemption. AP Read the reviewProbably most Wes Anderson-y of Wes Anderson’s films and certainly his finest, with a to-die-for cast and the best fur coat in the history of cinema. Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who’s to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” CC Read the reviewIf we are living through a golden age of space movies, here’s where it started, Alfonso Cuarón’s spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the reviewCharlie Kaufman’s existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same – except for Jennifer Jason Leigh’s scarred sales agent. “What is it to be human?” asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). “To ache?” Few films try to answer: this Fabergé egg of a film does. CS Read the reviewThe hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev’s anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of “reawakening the soul of the Russian people” as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the reviewBruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte.

CS Read the reviewJust nudging Gene Hackman’s Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson’s glorious 1930s confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core.

AP Read the reviewMichael Haneke won his first Palme d’Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by – and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the reviewDespite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuarón returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the reviewSteven Spielberg’s portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who’d have thought? AP Read the reviewThe Coen brothers don’t really do personal, but this is as close as they’ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late 60s, A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt – triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the reviewThe Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome – “la grande bellezza” – in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino’s regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the reviewAn extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the mid-60s. Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them – with little need for encouragement – to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers’ glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the reviewJapanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or for this exquisitely turned drama that – like much of Kore-eda’s previous output – explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned how they hang together – or not – is the film’s key theme. AP Read the reviewOne of Isabelle Huppert’s finest performances, and that’s saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it’s all she can do to survive. AP Read the reviewFrom director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the reviewBrutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director László Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the reviewA magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch’s softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the reviewThe most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It’s totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors – especially actors – before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it’s scattergun satirically, it’s spot-on. Mostly, though, it’s just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the 2ft puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the reviewAn official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in 18th-century Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel’s fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it’s a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory – a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Giménez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man’s sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called “the Malick of Latin American cinema” but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the reviewThe triumph of Barry Jenkins’s coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway’s envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize – and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It’s simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the reviewAfter a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard’s own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue – this is all symbolic. AP Read the reviewHaving made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France’s deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous 1961 Paris massacre. Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the reviewHas there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai’s smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they’re a couple, technically. It’s 1962. Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair – with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It’s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality – a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the reviewJonathan Glazer’s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to “take home” – in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the reviewTwelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater’s story of a child’s life between six and 18 is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you – at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane – as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents – Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the reviewSteve McQueen’s real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 19th-century Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup’s 1853 memoir is to be astonished by the film’s fidelity. CS Read the reviewPaul Thomas Anderson’s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie’s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure.The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview’s deranged “milkshake” pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

In my last year of high school, with the adult world beckoning but largely unexplored, Sam Mendes and Alan Ball’s tart, neat diorama of suburban discord seemed excitingly grown-up, a lucid, witty articulation of all my most cynical teenage suppositions about my elders: that they were tortured and miserable and a bit pathetic, though with enough money and sex drive to make their ennui soapily intriguing.I certainly didn’t want to grow up into Lester Burnham, the film’s skeevily loosened white-collar hero: though the film was sympathetic to his midlife crisis, complete with a sports car, an indifferently lost job and an infatuation with his teenage daughter’s schoolmate, it wasn’t so tin-eared as to deem him cool. Nor could I admire any of the variously uptight adults in his orbit, from his prissy, materialistic realtor wife to his tersely closeted nextdoor neighbor.Still, I suppose I hoped to be a bit like American Beauty itself: quick and quippy and a bit poetic, nasty-smart and slickly good-looking. To that end, I watched the film several times that year, repeatedly read and practically memorised the screenplay that came as a free tie-in to an issue of Sight \u0026amp Sound, and used it as a primary reference in a precocious English essay about white male irrelevance that, come to think of it, may have been more 2019 than 1999. “Look closer,” the poster instructed. I’m not sure I did, though I certainly thought about a lot. It was, for better or worse, a formative film.I wasn’t alone, of course. Many people far older than me formed a similar attachment to the film’s glib, elegant, philosophically underscored comedy, not least the collective members of the Academy, who handed it five Oscars, including best picture, director and actor – the second for Kevin Spacey, and the one prize for the film that voters would probably soonest take back, given what we now know of his own lecherous middle-aged proclivities. It was a year, moreover, when the Academy was led by critics to their eventual choice. The film sailed on a current of breathless rave reviews from its debut at the Toronto film festival – a more unusual place to launch a major awards contender, back when major studio productions still dominated the race, though its success there set a new model for prestige autumn films with golden ambitions.It’s easy to forget that American Beauty was seen as such unusually fresh, fashionable Oscar victor by the end of the 90s. In a decade dominated by burnished period spectacle, it was the first contemporary-set best picture winner since The Silence of the Lambs eight years before its win was seen as a triumph for riskier, more sensuous American cinema. A year after Harvey Weinstein famously strategised a seven-Oscar sweep for the dainty comforts of Shakespeare in Love over DreamWorks’ robust frontrunner Saving Private Ryan, American Beauty marked the latter studio’s revenge: its relative edginess handily trounced its main opponent (and Weinstein’s favored contender), Lasse Hallström’s wet, weedy literary adaptation The Cider House Rules. It seemed, for a time, that the Academy had anointed a new American classic.Yet the pushback against American Beauty in the intervening two decades has been swift and merciless – taking root well before Spacey’s personal and professional downfall, though that certainly hasn’t helped. Ask film critics of various ages about it now and you will tend to meet with a uniform sneer, along with a blanket dismissal of its cheap-shot picket-fence satire, its broad characterisation, its purportedly misogynistic view of career women, or its awestruck command of metaphor as flimsy and floaty as, well, a plastic bag dancing in the breeze.You might hear grudging acknowledgement of its formal artistry, including the satin tactility of the late Conrad L Hall’s cinematography, or the eerie, echo-y, endlessly imitated percussion of Thomas Newman’s once-ubiquitous score. But that, too, is tempered with dismissiveness toward its makers. Theatre maestro Mendes never had quite the directorial career expected of him after American Beauty, as every one of his subsequent dramatic films (from Road to Perdition to the indie misfire Away We Go) registered as something of a handsome, impersonal disappointment, until he found his groove as part of the James Bond machine in Skyfall. Ball, meanwhile, somewhat undermined his breakout script by returning to its dysfunctional family themes to far richer, more exploratory, more tonally complex effect in Six Feet Under for cable TV – the place, some have argued, where American Beauty’s warped sitcom premise belonged to begin with.Not helping its case was that 1999 came to be canonised by critics as a modern landmark year in American cinema, yielding a bounty of innovative, influential milestone works both in the multiplex and indie spheres: from The Matrix to Magnolia, The Sixth Sense to Being John Malkovich, Eyes Wide Shut to Election, Fight Club to The Talented Mr Ripley. (The latter, of course, was the jewel in Weinstein’s crown that year of course he set it aside for The Cider House Rules when it came to awards campaigning.) Critical consensus now has Michael Mann’s controlled, sinewy, morally shaded media study The Insider (seven nominations, zero wins) as the film most wronged by American Beauty’s Oscar haul.And yet, with all this revisionist perspective in my head, I popped in American Beauty recently to find it oddly, sinuously bewitching still. Dated, yes, but that’s a double-edged sword: it turns out to be an exquisitely presented time capsule, a snapshot of middle-class, notionally liberal white society entering a spasm of panic at the turn of both the century and the Clinton era. Its satire isn’t sophisticated, but it’s pointed, identifiable, and still often cuttingly funny, emblematic of a tone of withering pre-millennial snark that has since been earnestly outmoded, and not for the wittier.It was never intended as straightforward drama, but as garish suburban burlesque: a distorted funhouse mirror reflection of America already at its ugliest, with its performances and petal-strewn visuals expertly heightened to match. By that token, it works a charm: view Spacey’s brilliantly icky-droll performance not as an exercise in misplaced heroism, but as a grim, complicit prophet of an even more dishonest, self-serving era of American patriarchy to come. Spacey’s uncovered private life makes the joke a bit sicker, admittedly, but damn if he isn’t pitch perfect in this.There are, of course, false notes aplenty, ones more critics ought to have spotted even then: Annette Bening’s unhinged virtuosity only goes so far towards concealing what an ungenerous, ill-thought con the character of Carolyn Burnham is, not so much an empty woman as an empty construct. The teenage characters are all emo and no real emotion, vessels for the film’s sweetest but thinnest stabs at profundity. (American Beauty is a film that feels most authentic when it’s least sincere.) And that script I loved so much, for all its smart, savoury dialogue, is built on diagrammatic ironies – the homophobic military man’s a closet case, the self-styled slutty girl’s a virgin – that all ring a bit screenwriting 101, whatever truths are embedded within.And yet, and yet. I remain deeply, melancholically affected by American Beauty – partly, of course, because it reflects gently back to me the unformed, uncertain child I was when I first saw it. But it also moves me on its own terms and merits, its own sly critique of a fragile milieu, its own pristinely art-directed yin-yang of sadness and sarcasm, its own vulnerable but defensively lacquered performances. Hell, I still think all the rose petal business is woozily beautiful. Twenty years on, American Beauty isn’t as clever as we thought it was, though it’s inadvertently aged into a kind of wounded, embattled wisdom. Perhaps it’s worth looking closer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9003840d661d2fd9064b5ef21d3cf8c008a2f9b8/162_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b058d30ae59eea3116f785c58eea6","title":"rocks review high school east london film","story":"The East London-set drama boasts wit, a dynamic cast and a piercing sadness as it follows a Nigerian British girl and her younger brotherWith its energy, its creativity, its raw passion and its fun, this film and its newcomer cast are the best thing I’ve seen at this year’s Toronto film festival.It’s a social-realist adventure written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson and directed by Sarah Gavron about a multi-ethnic community in East London - in the spirit of Ken Loach’s Kes or Céline Sciamma’s Bande Des Filles. It’s tough, but it’s the opposite of miserablist. At the story’s centre is a group of year 11 girls and the star is Bukky Bakray, playing a Nigerian British girl nicknamed “Rocks”, who is maybe no great academic high-flier but really talented at cosmetics. Her dad is dead and she lives with her troubled mum, who has had, as a social worker delicately puts it, issues managing her medication.It is Rocks who largely has the responsibility of minding her kid brother, Emmanuel, gloriously played by D’Angelou Osei Kissiedu – and Emmanuel is a black-belt scene-stealer. He starts the film the way he means to go on, with a hilarious setpiece. Asking if he may say grace before dinner, Emmanuel launches into his own version of the Lord’s Prayer: “Our father – he’s up in heaven.” Rocks cheerfully calls that his “remix”. But there’s real trouble when Rocks’s mum absents herself from the family home.The odyssey of Rocks and Emmanuel – who in effect go on the run, fugitives from the world of grownup authority – provides a motor that drives the film but, in a way, its best moments come when Rocks and her friends are doing nothing more dramatically significant than just hanging out, talking and laughing. Occasionally these scenes erupt into something defiant, as when a food fight monumentally kicks off in the middle of a home economics class or when a girl tells her grumpy teacher: “You’re like this because you’ve got your period, sir.” (He furiously replies: “That’s actually really offensive.”) But really, the improv-type dialogue doesn’t need to go anywhere or do anything to be hugely entertaining and watchable. The group around Rocks are capable, in the best possible way, of laughing about nothing, laughing from sheer directionless joy. The sadness, when it comes, is piercing – yet so is Rocks’s resilience and her philosophical acceptance. Bukky Bakray gives a very moving portrayal of someone who has boldly accepted maternal responsibility for Emmanuel at the very moment that she is to be deprived of it. Of course, there is a larger sadness here: the realisation that the sheer energy and dynamism of this group is likely to be dissipated and wasted when they leave school – society will probably not find a way to tap this resource. When the class is taught about Picasso and cubism and they make spoof Picasso cut-out images of people’s faces cut from magazines, it is a funny moment, but serious too, because there is a real sense of potential. This film is such a rush of vitality. It rocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3338d4842a212e27ba2e4fb17d4bc9b1cac1d160/0_300_6566_3939/master/6566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a17c7575aebe1048a15d3162b05bb05c","title":"tyrone mings everything with academy my idea","story":"It is just before 6.30pm on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after England defeated Kosovo in an eight-goal thriller, and Harry Kane is refusing to give Tyrone Mings a moment’s peace on a five-a-side pitch in Birmingham. This Kane is so small, though, that he could almost run between Mings’s legs. “Incredible, isn’t it? He could have at least put a Mings shirt on!” the Aston Villa defender says, laughing about one of the youngsters at his new academy.Mings chuckles and shakes his head as he allows himself a moment to take in everything that has gone on during the last week. “To see people running around with Kane shirts on here … I’m still a Kane fan myself. He’s an England player and until I step on the pitch with him, I wouldn’t class myself as one. But they’re people I was in the changing room with last night all week I’ve been training with, competing against and learning from them. I probably don’t realise what level I’m at because I don’t see myself as that person.”“Tyrone from Chippenham” is how Mings described himself when we met five years ago, at a time when he was starting to cause a bit of a stir with Ipswich in the Championship. While his life has changed so much since then, his personality is just the same. For the best part of an hour Mings has been playing football with 36 children, aged six to 16, on the artificial pitches in Nechells, less than a couple of miles from Villa Park. At 6ft 5in and with a wide grin, he is the biggest kid of the lot.Refreshingly, there is nobody holding Mings’ hand, telling him where to go and what to do, or ushering him out of the door as soon as the photographs have been taken, which is often the case with footballers. In fact, long after training has finished Mings is posing for pictures not only with the children and their parents but also with the five-a-side footballers who turned up to play on the pitches next door and did a double-take when they realised that the newest member of Gareth Southgate’s England squad was a few yards away.“Everything that has happened with the academy so far has been my idea,” Mings says, proudly. “I always wanted to give something back. And the message that we wanted to send out by setting up the academy was that we’re not trying to take people away from what they’re currently doing with their clubs, and that we want to give children the experiences that I felt were beneficial to me growing up, and that was that my best development came from enjoying my football and not feeling that I had to worry about a result, getting in the team or disappointing or impressing someone.”With A licence coaches overseeing his academies in Bristol and now Birmingham, and the children charged £6 a session, it is put to Mings that he cannot be making any money out of this venture. “It costs me a fortune,” he replies, laughing. “Nah, it doesn’t cost me a fortune but it does cost me money.“We only use a certain type of pitch and location. We like to have more coaches than we need, to give more of a human element to the coaching. The coaches who are managing the sessions are qualified to a high level – they’re more expensive but that’s a choice that we make. If we have poor coaches, that’s a reflection of me and a reflection of what we think we can give to the kids.”There is an interesting debate to be had around young children playing football in non-pressurised environments, similar to the one Mings has set up, or joining a professional club. Mings was released by Southampton at 15 and, much as he enjoyed being with a professional club at the time, he now sees things a little differently. “I think I missed out on so many good experiences – maybe priceless experiences – playing with my friends when I was growing up. I was in an academy from the age of eight. I couldn’t play for my grassroots team then. It’s incredible, really, because what are they really protecting?“For parents it’s a difficult option to turn down. If you want your child to be a footballer, it’s so hard to know whether they will ever get that chance again. But knowing what I know now, I think I would try and keep them away for as long as possible. Kids will never go under the radar any more because there are so many scouts at grassroots level. Also, if you come out of a professional academy, it’s a very lonely place for a child and some kids don’t bounce back from it.”Mings is the exception to the rule, not just in terms of bouncing back but getting to the very top. Reporting to St George’s Park last week was a surreal moment for him. “I remember going into dinner and sitting around the table for the first time and thinking: ‘Bloody hell, it feels crazy to be sitting here with these people.’ People who I see as being at the pinnacle of English football, people who have just won the Champions League, won the Premier League, played in the World Cup semi-finals. It was baffling. Really baffling.”Not that Mings felt out of his depth when it mattered. “I had a good few conversations with the manager. His feedback was positive. I felt like I gave a good account of myself in and around the camp. Unfortunately I didn’t get any minutes but I’ll be so much better for the experience when that day does eventually come.“And even going back to Villa, I said to the England manager that this has lit a fire in me that I never even knew was there. I’ve seen the other side of the fence. This is something I could only have dreamed of at times. So to go there and be involved in the set-up has sent me back to Villa even hungrier than I was at the start of the season.”It is clear Mings is in a good place following his permanent transfer from Bournemouth, where he “never felt like a real integral part of the squad”. At Villa, he talks about being able to play with freedom, partly because of the faith that Dean Smith, the manager, has in him but also because of his relationship with the supporters.He is a hero to many, especially the youngsters. “It’s something I take great pride in but I don’t see myself as what those kids see me as tonight, which is probably a good thing,” Mings adds, smiling. “I still have the same group of friends from school and I’ve stayed humble. So while it’s really nice to see those kids look up to me, I’ll go home in a minute, have some Haribo, flick the TV on and go back to normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9026c89734f62a9e07390f1e656877b76a2a6033/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a742f5dff58aa91933e381f0029817c","title":"new zealand man copywriter clown redundancy","story":"Josh Thompson hired clown – who reportedly mimed crying as the paperwork was handed over – as emotional support aideIf you think emotional support animals have got out of control, prepare yourself for news of an emotional support clown.An Auckland advertising copywriter brought a clown to his redundancy meeting, as first reported in the New Zealand Herald on Friday.New Zealand legally requires employers to allow workers the option of bringing a support person to serious disciplinary meetings, usually relating to an employee’s prospective dismissal.After FCB New Zealand lost a significant client and began layoffs, Josh Thompson, who had reportedly been with the company for five months, received an ominous email from his bosses that read: “Bad news. We’re having a meeting to discuss your role.”Faced with the task of securing an appropriate support person for the potentially tense meeting, Thompson, an aspiring comedian, said: “I thought it’s best to bring in a professional, and so I paid $200 and hired a clown.”The clown, who Thompson refers to as “Joe”, crafted balloon animals throughout the meeting, including a poodle. His antics were squeaky, and Thompson’s bosses had to request he quieten down several times.“It’s further understood,” reported the Herald, “that the clown mimed crying when the redundancy paperwork was handed over.”A picture of the meeting, taken through a boardroom’s glass doors by an unknown spectator, is of compromised quality, though one can detect that Joe, the clown, is wearing a colorful hat and a yellow bib, and that Thompson, leaning back in his chair, indeed looks relaxed for someone in the process of getting laid off.Thompson told Magic Talk radio: “I mean, I did get fired, but apart from that it was all smooth running.”Fortunately, Thompson will not be out of work for long. The Australian ad agency DDB confirmed Thompson will start a new role in its office next week.As of publishing, no reports have suggested what’s next for Joe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe87f98f8f17af141f2a5748fa2c089f701d3188/0_230_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b40e37344be103bad10606031c5d928","title":"lets move to lancaster lancashire grander than you might think","story":"A slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildingsWhat’s going for it? Grander than you might think, Lancaster, if you think about it at all. Only intrepid tour coaches make it this far, leaving this slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildings largely for the Lancastrians. Its severe castle, high on the hill, looks ripped enough to withstand a meteorite, while the streets and squares below, curling round the foot of Castle Hill and spreading up to Dalton Square and the Town Hall, are thick with columned porticoes, churches and stone Georgian townhouses. This grandeur came at a cost, of course, one mostly paid by slaves. Lancaster was once the fourth largest slave trade port in England after London, Liverpool and Bristol, a fact it finally acknowledged in 2005 with a memorial to the millions amid the warehouses and wharves on St George’s Quay. Far more searing, though, is a tiny 18th-century grave to a slave who died soon after arriving, lonely amid salt marshes by the seashore just outside the city, at Sunderland Point. Residents and schoolchildren tend it still, with flowers and painted stones.The case against… More could be made of the city’s riverfront and recent developments and buildings don’t live up to the city’s heritage.Well connected?

Read our countdown of passionate pop, electrifying rock and anthemic rap – and see if you agreeby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas (1-50)  Laura Snapes and April Curtin (51-100)Seven years after her previous album, Apple’s return sidelined her orchestral trademarks for an austere, homespun sound that exposed her insular lyrics even more starkly. Listen to the album.The first album album from an artist whose records had previously propped up killer singles with passable fillers turned her disaffection and disappointment into generational anthems. Listen to the album.The Malian guitarist set a new career benchmark with this intimate set, adding classical western harp and African ngoni to her subtle, bluesy electric guitar. Listen to the album.Trip-hop duo Moloko was dead, and Murphy teamed up with Matthew Herbert for this eclectic, saucy – and still underrated – pop record that anticipated the arrival of Lady Gaga by three years. Listen to the album.Drawing from house, psychedelia and even Bollywood soundtracks, Missy’s third – the one responsible for Get Ur Freak On – forced pop to catch up with her yet again. Listen to the album.XCX stopped waiting around for mainstream acceptance and showed the normies what they were missing with this bracingly eclectic, guest-laden mixtape. Listen to the album.Merrill Nisker grafted sweaty, human filth on to the clean machine shock of electroclash on her hilarious, titillating debut as Peaches. Listen to the album.Filled with crushing, funereal dirges and a song about wanting to encase a newborn baby in metal to prevent its growth, the Duluth group’s fifth album was nonetheless inexplicably beautiful. Listen to the album.Part state-of-the-nation opus, part eye-opening trawl through the unexplored depths of Badu’s brain. Listen to the album.Two Malian greats met for this soothing, spontaneous record of guitar and kora that is as subtly textured as it is generous. Listen to the album.No disposable vocalist or featured artist, the charismatic, club-savvy south Londoner gave dubstep its first real star. Listen to the album.Swift’s first “officially documented pop album” saw her shake off any remaining country trappings to become a gleaming synthpop behemoth. Listen to the album.The Seattle group’s debut heralded a generation’s post-recession retreat into rural comforts, conjuring a pastoral idyll from the best of west coast folk and British traditionalism. Listen to the album.The finest boyband breakout since Robbie Williams’s Life Thru a Lens, and that’s not damning with faint praise: Timberlake’s NeptunesTimbaland-helmed debut was slick, sexy and most importantly, convincing. Listen to the album.Smith’s final album followed his brief adoption by Hollywood, and added a cinematic grandeur to his work – but, thankfully, it didn’t swamp his haunted songwriting. Listen to the album.The album that ushered in the moody, neon-lit synthpop that would define the rest of the decade, Ruth Radelet playing Nico to Johnny Jewel’s Velvet Underground-worthy cool. Listen to the album.Twenty-five years after forming, the Congolese group made their name with this rhythmic explosion of likembes (thumb pianos) put through junkyard amplification. Listen to the album.Written before the death of one of Cave’s teenage sons – not after it, as was often assumed – Skeleton Tree nonetheless cast Cave’s recurring themes in unsettlingly anaesthetised new light. Listen to the album.The album that every hushed, autumnal indie record aspires to be, a cocoon of disaffection. Listen to the album.Madlib and MF Doom combined for an album that rattled with enough innovation and enough bars to prop up 10 records. Listen to the album.The provocative pop debut that made pastiche into an art form and revelled in the artifice and ambition of fame. Listen to the album.West justified his arrogance by setting it alongside sharp political commentary (at a time when few of his peers were speaking up) and fiercely arresting production. Listen to the album.Despite an outstanding lineup of guests and producers, all eyes were on Drake’s journey into and out of heartbreak, variously bitter, angry and doe-eyed. Listen to the album.Kevin Martin’s discordant and seductive second, voicing his discontent via an array of guest MCs. Listen to the album.Wild Beasts were a sad casualty of the last decade, but Two Dancers found the Cumbrian lads at their prime, bringing Chaucerian ribaldry to football terrace hooks. Listen to the album.A multicultural celebration, a political statement and a middle finger up to misogynists. Listen to the album.The Malian artist made his best album at the age of 53, his playing and duets with female singers conveying a sense of spontaneity that belied his deep craft. Listen to the album.A biting subversion of the era’s cocaine rap, evident in the despairing lyrics and magnetically ruined textures. Listen to the album.The voice of a generation: pissed, pissed off and funny, Allen’s debut brought a welcome reality check to a sheeny era of pop. Listen to the album.Midlake backed the former Czars frontman on this remarkable return to form following a period of heartbreak, addiction and depression. Listen to the album.Thought shaky at the time, her controversial debut – the one responsible for Video Games – has since acquired cult status. Listen to the album.Single A-Punk masked a hugely erse album: a strange yet winning mix of flutes, strings and Afrobeat. Listen to the album.The moment they made the transition from white-collar worriers to rarefied indie giants: the elegiac Boxer is as much of a New York totem as Is This It or Interpol’s debut. Listen to the album.Eminem’s third album has dated horribly with its homophobia and gleeful suggestion of violence against women, but in other parts of the album the incisiveness with which he unspools his misanthropic take on life remains transgressively vital. Listen to the album.Pristine neo-soul played by an old soul in a 19-year-old’s body. On her debut, Keys was a traditionalist steeped in pedigree, but not so schooled that it stifled her vulnerability. Listen to the album.Loaded, but only in the sense that XTRMNTR suggested heavy artillery locked and ready to fire: few good times here. Listen to the album.Lascivious, soulful and compellingly weird, Kelis was ahead of her time – though it’s still thrilling to remember that the extremely unsubtle Milkshake was a No 2 hit. Listen to the album.Gothic and abrasive in equal parts, the Swedish brother-sister duo’s third album offered ceaseless electronic invention at a time when their synth-minded peers were content to till their way through music history’s trash. Listen to the album.Infectious ego, unknockable confidence and hysterical commentary: a relic from lighter days that did not foresee West’s extraordinary evolution. Listen to the album.Matching Jonathan Richman for wry, detail-heavy storytelling and Sufjan Stevens for orchestral whimsy, Lekman elevated romantic mishaps in his Gothenburg home town to cinematic proportions. Listen to the album.A bracing introduction to an uncontainable ambition: Monáe’s intergalactic debut proper straddled James Brown funk, pastoral whimsy and indie quirk, and later albums proved this was barely a fraction of her talents. Listen to the album.This masterpiece in turning samples and meticulous tinkering into an era-defining production statement was released the week of the rapper’s death. Listen to the album.Winehouse at her most innocent – if you could ever call her that, given the cheekiness of songs like Fuck Me Pumps. Listen to the album.Mixing chilling realism with devastating metaphor, Vordul Mega and Vast Aire painted a grim, dystopian vision of their native New York City. Listen to the album.Sex, sedition and Marilyn Monroe reveries fuelled Annie Clark’s third album, which slipped serrated blades through the barbiturate wooze. Listen to the album.The Springsteen comparisons were fair: not since the Boss had music sounded so good driving along an empty highway. Listen to the album.Whether shaking your ass to Digital Witness or drifting off with Prince Johnny, you did so under a constant cloudburst of ideas. Listen to the album.Pharrell at his horniest ever – Truth or Dare hints at an orgy before Tape You records the sounds of one – but Bobby James is one of his loveliest ballads. Listen to the album.Overlapping acoustic guitars blend like plumes of smoke, and inspired snatches of melody flit by – but bursts of noise and distortion herald danger deep in the woods. Listen to the album.Theirs was the New York of Taxi Driver or Midnight Cowboy: fraught with rain and danger, energy crackling like the wires of a vandalised phone box. Like their peers the Strokes, the quartet made rhythm guitar the lead and foregrounded the bass, but cast them in sombre black suits rather than artfully distressed denim. Their ballad NYC became an unofficial civic anthem, synthesising the mix of sorrow and tenacity that defined the city in the wake of 911. Listen to the album.After D’Angelo’s years in the wilderness, struggling with addiction and indirection, many thought he was finished. He not only came back, but did so with one of the most incendiary soul records in decades. The funk deepened – the way Prayer smears its on-beat is astonishing – along with his social conscience on The Charade, though the bedroom door still beckoned constantly. Listen to the album.It’s now impossible to imagine a world without Seven Nation Army, chanted from football terraces to political rallies. The band’s biggest hit set the template for Elephant: brooding moods, measured out in eighths by Meg White, would tip over into cathartic squalls of blues rock. Jack White’s much-lampooned fetish for analogue production is legitimate – you can almost feel the breeze from the amps on your face as the riffs strut out – and he squeezed more tone out of the electric guitar than almost anyone else that decade. Listen to the album.The trio had always sounded – appealingly – like a band rehearsing in a garage, but here they threatened to blow its door open and its walls apart. Like a superhero who doesn’t realise their own strength, everything hits too hard, burning the edges of the guitars and drums with fuzz. Their most ferocious album, then, though the wry and bitter ballad Modern Girl uses the distortion to prettier ends. Listen to the album.A massive leap in ambition as the synthpop of Visions was pulled into HD, driven up a gear and transformed into pop-punk as thrillingly fast and trashy as a Nascar race. Tracks such as Kill V Maim were made for the balls of your feet, full of the chillingly cutesy pep of east Asian pop, but the best tracks were the robo-funky World Princess Part II and the demo version of Realiti: the sound of speeding through a city, its sounds muffled inside a luxury sedan. Listen to the album.Released more than 10 years since their pair of trip-hop-defining albums, Third proved the west country trio still had it – it being their particular mood of bruised, bloodied tenacity in a world that wasn’t just uncaring, but actively violent. While they tease out the Morricone influence all the more, the highs are all their own – krautrock nightmare We Carry On cyberpunk masterwork Machine Gun – on a record that has become one of the most influential of its era. Listen to the album.A relatively bummer record as the polo-shirted princes of prep entered an early midlife crisis: “Wisdom’s a gift but you’d trade it for youth,” Ezra Koenig sings at one point. But that wisdom, an upgrade from the mere cleverness of their earlier work, led to their most rounded songwriting yet, still gassed up with the fizz of old. Listen to the album.More accessible but no less skilful or hard-hitting than its predecessors, Damn rightly became the first non jazz or classical album to win the Pulitzer prize for music. Kendrick’s brilliance is to swoop between scales – nations, communities and iniduals – to create a truly rounded portrait of contemporary love and politics, and the sheer lip-smacking perfection of his flow on Humble made it his biggest track yet. Listen to the album.A band working in perfect equilibrium, where wild prog and bug-eyed Burroughs-esque visions were tethered by earthy punk. The cracked poetry (“Jigsaw pattern dominoes left a trail  The whites of their eyes  Polaroids of the tale”) was chewed up and then spat out for moshpit soundbites (“Cut away!”, “Is it heavier than air?”), between see-sawing riffs and bursts of pure noise. Listen to the album.That Frank Ocean appears three times in this list is testament to his universal appeal – this mixtape debut opened with a Coldplay cover, and Radiohead, the Eagles and even a sample of Nicole Kidman crop up, too. Released by the Odd Future collective, he and they have done so much in the last decade to break rap and R\u0026ampB out of tired, restrictive genre considerations. Listen to the album.With its profile raised by a Mercury prize win, this album was the first time many people had encountered Anohni’s voice, which didn’t so much apply vibrato as become it: a beautifully wobbling, wavering thing that instantly entranced. Rooted in the cabaret songcraft of queer New York, she would go on to embrace electronic pop. Listen to the album.Made amid her most troubled phase, Blackout defied the odds to become a diamond pressed from trash. The production is all sleazy, buzzing electro, and Britney’s melodies have the twisted naivety of nursery rhymes. The two big singles are genius: Piece of Me bats back tabloid gossip with a sonic golf club, and Gimme More is her best-ever song, an erotic psychodrama where the purring come-ons of the title also sound like a woman drowning under her ambition. Listen to the album.For all the hype, the Brooklyn scene of the early 00s didn’t produce many genuine rock stars, but Karen O was its finest. On the group’s debut, she could electrify her withering bluesy scorn with a single yelp, and suddenly she’d be a banshee screaming round the rafters meanwhile the song Maps was pure vulnerability. Yeah Yeah Yeahs is not just O’s show: like Jack White, the other great guitarist of those years, Nick Zinner could make his axe into bass and lead at all once, and drummer Brian Chase pits tub-thumping toms against seething hi-hats. Listen to the album.After bulging baroque creations The Age of Adz and The BQE, Stevens pared everything back to soft electronics and fingerpicking for this moving rumination on his stepfather and late mother. He stumbles, numb, through his own poetry, pondering suicide, gaining existential clarity and – crucially – finding beauty: “The breakers in the bar  The neighbour’s greeting.” Listen to the album.Tiny, lisping and with a high-pitched voice, Grimes weathered plenty of sexism with her breakthrough – but converted even indie snobs with her take on rave, Italo and industrial synthpop. The electro bass lines are the album’s signature, lurching from the deep, but it is her vocals that make it: a shapeshifting chorus of chattering gothic cheerleaders, solemn choristers and trance as. Listen to the album.After keeping their heads down for their brilliant 1997 debut, letting Spike Jonze videos do the talking, Daft Punk revealed themselves – sort of. The duo were obscured behind robot heads, and their music got equally playful: cock-rock guitars, vocoders and brilliantly manipulated slivers of records by ELO, Tavares and Eddie Johns condensed into tinny yet heavy filter-house. Listen to the album.It has the air of a piece of obsessional outsider art: 3,500 samples stitched together into a dense tapestry of goofy hip-hop and lounge pop. Miraculously, it makes a virtue of its maximalism: the title track thick with jasmine and tropical heat, Electricity jumping out of the speakers like a jack in the box. Listen to the album.The backstory is almost a parody of a certain kind of earnest dude: retreating to the woods with just a guitar to get over a breakup and sort out his crappy life. But after listening to the songs he came back down the hill with, the story becomes gilded and mythic: lightly fleshed out with vocal harmonies and drums, they are sensationally beautiful. Listen to the album.MIA frequently showed just how conservative the US is by doing ordinary things – rapping while pregnant, sticking her middle finger up – that nevertheless had people reaching for the smelling salts. It all began with her debut collection of blown-out rap and dancehall, stitched together with samples from a trolley dash down the unregulated internet – a harbinger of our cosmopolitan post-genre age. Listen to the album.The ghosts of London raves gone by are conjured by this ouija board of a record, where garage vocals flit upward past dust-covered breakbeats. The influence of this and his 2006 debut cannot be overstated, feeding into the dub songcraft of the xx and James Blake, as well as an entire generation of ambient producers. It also anticipated the way London’s clubland – and indeed communities – would be hollowed out by gentrification. Listen to the album.By blending the frat-boy energy of nu-metal with the goth moods of Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins, the northern Californians united rival factions of brooding teenagers with these strangely sexy studies in tension and release. Chino Moreno’s voice is magnificently plastic – rapping, bellowing, crooning, and deploying his secret weapon: vocal fry that creaks like a door to a haunted house. Listen to the album.This album is lauded for the three masterpieces Aaliyah made with Timbaland – Try Again, More Than a Woman and We Need a Resolution – that lend a serpentine malevolence to her voice, but there are also strong old-school jams and languorous ballads. Lesser R\u0026ampB stars match their voice to the beat – Aaliyah’s genius, tragically cut short when she was killed in a plane crash, was to slink through it with an almost Latin sense of rhythm. Album not on streaming services.The gentle glitches and serene pulses on this intimate, sensual, clean record could sound naive, even simplistic, when put next to the complexity of her recent work with the producer Arca, but Vespertine remains one of Björk’s defining records thanks to the strength of its songwriting. Unison rivals Massive Attack’s Unfinished Sympathy as the great ballad of trip-hop It’s Not Up to You is almost Disney-esque in its sweeping beauty. Listen to the album.Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim made the most compelling duets of the period: rather than singing to each other, it was as if two people were going through the same thing without the other knowing it – the perfect mood music for the disconnected interconnection of dating apps and social media. Listen to the album.We’d seen Beyoncé angry before, whether defiant on Survivor or chillingly, wittily calm on Irreplaceable, but never like this. Made after notable incidents of police brutality, Lemonade was charged with real political fervour, while there were numerous sharp jabs at Jay-Z for doing whatever predicated that elevator fight with her sister Solange. As a result, the final call for her ladies to get in formation felt genuinely martial. Listen to the album.Released two days before he died, Blackstar saw Bowie pour everything left of him into his best album since his 70s hot streak. He spliced the itchy drum’n’bass and industrial moods that fascinated him in the 90s with terrifically freaky jazz, symphonic balladry and – on Girl Loves Me – authentically heavy rap. “I’m dying to push their backs against the grain  and fool them all again,” he sang. And he did. Listen to the album.Although less than the sum of their parts as they were on Stankonia, and with neither editing out the other’s longueurs, the ided members of OutKast nevertheless delivered a vivacious pair of solo turns. Big Boi embraced saucy brass licks and propulsive flow while André 3000 tapdanced through funk, though each arrived at solid gold pop: The Way You Move and Hey Ya! are both deserved wedding disco staples. Listen to the album.Harvey won her first Mercury prize for Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea on 911. She won her second for her other masterpiece, released 10 years later, in the shadow of the wars that dragged on between them. There is such anger as she reaches back to the first world war to show how every generation destroys its young in the same way – summed up by the pompous fanfare in The Glorious Land, crushed by a tank of blues-rock. Listen to the album.The deaths of relatives of band members Regine Chassaigne, Richard Reed Parry, and Win and Will Butler underpinned the (mostly) Canadian band’s debut. The songs here are full of the horrible electricity of grief, Win Butler sometimes hollering at the pain, sometimes burned out by it. But the massed choruses suggest relief can be found in family, be it blood or otherwise, marking the arrival of one of the period’s few great arena bands. Listen to the album.More city than sea, PJ Harvey’s most accessible and open-hearted record conjures that feeling of being on a rooftop, wanting to hear every story in the streets below you. It is full of energy, Harvey stalking the gutters and subways it is full of sex, most of it new and dangerously in flux. But then there are moments on songs such as Beautiful Feeling or Horses in My Dreams, where the mass of bricks and steel dissipates and you’re adrift on the ocean. Listen to the album.Kanye ed into a hell of racism, commerce, relationship strife and his own ego, with beats made alongside a brains trust of experimental producers. It seethes with trauma both personal and social, and the strongest moments consider how black America is sticking its head in the sand – even Kanye himself, fretting about Kim while a sample of lynching lament Strange Fruit plays. But there are flickers of his old cheeky humour, especially in the immortal line: “Hurry up with my damn croissants!” Listen to the album.The first rap masterpiece of the century was an epic that covered all of hip-hop’s bases – horndog G-funk on We Luv Deez Hoez and I’ll Call B4 I Cum, raunchy boom-bap on Xplosion, rap-rock on Gasoline Dreams, pop on Ms Jackson – but added endless new flavours: drum’n’bass, acid, psychedelic soul. Listen to the album.From the spine-tingling four-note downward melody that opens Everything in Its Right Place, it was clear that Radiohead had taken a huge leap into colder, stranger territory. The electronic influences that had filtered into OK Computer reached maturity – most spectacularly on techno anthem Idioteque – though there are way more guitars than its reputation suggests. Listen to the album.By blending the earnestness of ballad singing with cascading waves of electropop, Robyn became the master of heartbreak on the dancefloor. There is another side here, too: chatty, puckish and getting over it all. The anchor of the album – initially released in a trailblazing three parts across 2010 – was Dancing on My Own, a breakup song with a wildly transgressive edge: is there a secret erotic thrill behind the pain of going to the club to watch her partner with their new girlfriend? Listen to the album.The breakthrough moment for rap’s greatest ever talent. Loosely based around an LA street narrative, the storytelling was gripping the bangers banged hard and it has Lamar’s most gorgeous melodies, on Money Trees, Swimming Pools (Drank) and Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe. The blithe stoicism of his flow, seemingly resigned to a violent death at any moment, fills the record with poignancy, and transmutes his words into wisdom. Listen to the album.The sun-soaked indolence of being young in LA is etched in aquamarine, purple and, yes, orange on this psychedelic-pop landmark. The melody writing on Forrest Gump, Sweet Life, Thinkin Bout You, Lost and others is joyously accomplished and sturdy, leaving room for 10-minute electro suites, jazz-funk flexing, stoner rap and smoky neo-soul. A generation’s Stevie Wonder had arrived. Listen to the album.Initially grabbing headlines for its pay-what-you-want release online, it quickly became clear that this was one of Radiohead’s greatest albums. Undoing some of the knotted tension of the post-Bends era, it has rollicking rockers (Bodysnatchers, Jigsaw Falling into Place) and restless jitters (15 Step, Weird FishesArpeggi), but the core songs are deep, considered trip-hop ballads such as Reckoner, House of Cards and All I Need. Listen to the album.Less immediately catchy than its predecessor, Channel Orange, Blonde is the more ambitious and visionary record. Resistant to being boxed in any one genre, the percussion retreats, the voice warps, the focus wanders and the emotion deepens as Ocean slips and stumbles through a series of poetic romances. A magical, impossible-to-imitate record. Listen to the album.Love and self have always been Beyoncé’s two grand themes, but they were each invested with more passion and nuance than ever before on her fifth solo album. Appearing from nowhere with videos for every track, it announced her as the era’s defining megastar – marketing campaigns, it implied, were for the little people. But the album has endured past its grand entrance thanks to its detailed, impassioned considerations of femininity and marital sexuality. Listen to the album.He may now sing in an ironic mid-Atlantic croon, but Alex Turner started off with the most tangibly south Yorkshire voice in pop since Jarvis Cocker. Over street-fighting indie rock, he told of dirty dancefloors and scummy men, an observer sitting with his faced pressed up against a taxi window on a Saturday night watching humans bounce off one another. Listen to the album.You can almost touch the gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads in Mike Skinner’s debut, a love letter to living for the weekend written in UK garage that heralded the arrival of a brilliant British storyteller – Weak Become Heroes remains the single greatest evocation of being on ecstasy in a club. Listen to the album.If Wiley’s “eski beats” acknowledged grime’s froideur, then Dizzee Rascal turned the temperature down further: his debut is a chillblained study in urban harshness that remains grime’s masterpiece album. Amid videogame clatter, Rascal’s voice is full of scorn and bafflement as he considers girls, rivals and his place in the world. Listen to the album.James Murphy’s group were the smart, snippy toast of Brooklyn after the hyper-literate breakthrough tracks Losing My Edge and Yeah. On their second album, they broke through the snark, pondering their identities as New Yorkers, Americans and thirtysomethings – and with a range of potential dance moves, from pogoing to sleek disco shapes. Listen to the album.Folding in influences from LA’s beat scene – including Kamasi Washington and Flying Lotus – Lamar exploded the possibilities for rap in the 2010s, bouncing like a car down Crenshaw on to neo-soul, jazz and squelchy funk. The police-baiting Alright became a civil-rights anthem for the post-Ferguson era – indeed, as a celebration of the richness of black artistry, the whole album was a riposte to bigotry. Listen to the album.He would later lose the thread in a very public fashion, but Kanye West pulled every strand of his genius and torment together on his masterpiece: anthemic choruses, psychodrama lyrics and an all-star cast, from Bon Iver to that Nicki Minaj verse. West’s bombastic production, meanwhile, included samples of everything from King Crimson to Aphex Twin: a symphony to a new, omnivorous digital culture. Listen to the album.After Britpop devolved into bedwetter indie and the US was churning out goofy pop-punk, the debut album by the New York quintet showed rock how to be cool again: all droll, drawling observations and guitar lines that steamed into a e bar to show up the clientele. Oh, and your boss trying to be trendy by wearing a T-shirt under his blazer at the office on Fridays? Blame these guys. Listen to the album.That title sounds horribly prescient in the wake of the substance misuse that would kill her, but Winehouse was incandescently alive – funny, pissed off, in love – on her finest album. Producer Mark Ronson’s luxuriant backings, which cherrypicked from the previous century of popular music (doo-wop, soul, hip-hop), are saved from mere classiness by that voice: impetuous, inimitable, always reaching for the wrong interval that turns out to be totally right.

Tony Blair described having to learn to use a mobile phone, after years when aides took charge of all his communications. Theresa May was to be seen earlier this week pottering about in the palace of Westminster, not a flunky in sight, buying herself lunch.But the sense from David Cameron’s Times interview is that the hardest readjustment has been getting used to the idea of not always being a winner.Cameron once reportedly said he wanted to be prime minister, because “I think I’d be good at it” and when he unexpectedly secured a majority at the 2015 general election, he and George Osborne saw it as confirmation of their political genius.They were indeed clever, and ruthless – but not ruthless enough, it turned out, when it came to the brutal 2016 referendum campaign, the outcome of which Cameron says made him “depressed”.Much of his fury is directed at Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his erstwhile political and personal friends, whom he accuses of behaving “appallingly”.Ironically, had Cameron’s memoir been published several months ago when it was originally due to appear, these character notes on his old rivals would have seemed of little more than historical interest.But he has burst out of his shepherd’s hut just as the Vote Leave crew are back together in Downing Street, and applying the same battering-ram approach to parliament, the judiciary and anyone else who stands in their way, as they did to the Stronger In campaigners in 2016.And the “Tory psychodrama” that he claims prevented the remainers’ message from getting through has become a full-scale civil war, that could yet rend his old party in two.Yet what Dave doesn’t really seem to feel, is a heavy weight of personal responsibility.Osborne apparently still chides him, “you and your fucking referendum”.But Cameron still believes it was necessary and all but inevitable because of the pressures inside his own party and out in the country at large and that his EU renegotiation was a grand idea that could have been a “boon” for Britain if the leavers’ dastardly tactics hadn’t stopped him from getting his message across to the great British public.And his analysis of the great rupture of Brexit appears to be that its causes lie more in the political swordsmanship of that brief campaign in the summer of 2016, than in the years of public sector austerity, industrial decline and anti-immigrant rhetoric that preceded it.It’s much too soon to say, of course – but history may well judge otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860dc81d49632104580b413e5abdd2c8eacaa49b/0_193_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853ea87535ea2e9df7af364cfdf9b3a6","title":"tories misrepresent critical bbc news article in facebook ad","story":"Incorrect figure on school spending used alongside BBC logo and web addressThe Conservative party has been funding ads on Facebook that present a BBC News article as endorsing the government’s inflated figure for school spending – when the article actually criticised the figure’s credibility.Since the beginning of September the Conservative party has paid for ads on Facebook that link to a BBC article on school funding, with the headline “£14 billion pound cash boost for schools” appearing between a photo with the BBC News logo and its web address BBCNews.Sean Coughlan, the BBC’s education editor, said the BBC article only used the government’s £14bn figure in order to dismiss it. “The only reference to the £14bn figure in the story is from the head of stats saying it’s not a correct figure to use,” Coughlan said on Twitter.A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We are looking into this matter.”The BBC News article by Coughlan carried the headline: “School spending: multi-billion pound cash boost announced,” referring to the increased funding for schools in England announced by Boris Johnson in August.But the BBC article noted that annual school spending would rise by £2.6bn initially and culminate in extra annual funding in three-year’s time of £7.1bn – half the amount trumpeted in the Conservative party’s Facebook ads.The article carried analysis by Robert Cuffe, the BBC’s head of statistics, discussing the funding announcement: “The prime minister said he would invest ‘over £14bn in primary and secondary education between now and 2022-23’. That includes an additional £2.6bn next year, £4.8bn the year after that and £7.1bn in 2022-23. When you add all three together, you get £14.5bn, but that’s not normally how we talk about spending increases.”Cuffe concluded: “Describing this as a £14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being.”Full Fact, the fact-checking organisation that first wrote about the ads, said about 200,000-500,000 impressions of different versions of the ads had been displayed on Facebook. The ads appear to have been deactivated today.“If you were looking at the ad the Conservative party posted, you would be forgiven for thinking that the BBC headline actually read ‘£14 billion pound cash boost for schools’,” Full Fact stated.Some versions of the ad carried photos of Johnson and linked directly to the Conservative party website, with the headline: “We’re giving a £14 billion cash boost to schools across the UK.”Another version of the ad began: “Tell this news to a friend. We’re giving schools a record £14bn, levelling up per pupil funding across the country.”In his speech confirming the additional spending, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, told parliament: “Today we are delivering on our pledge to increase school spending by £7.1 billion by 2022-23.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd1fab107e1ad17ed62c23ea3091dff29f19bc8/0_1_1459_875/master/1459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5603c3016b8850b4b289558f44176c96","title":"black hole at centre of our galaxy is getting hungrier say scientists","story":"Scientists say Milky Way’s Sagittarius A* has been more active in recent months Unseeable and inescapable, black holes already rank among the more sinister phenomena out in the cosmos. So it may come as disconcerting news that the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way appears to be growing hungrier.Astronomers monitoring the colossal object, called Sagittarius A*, found that in the past year it appears to have consumed nearby matter at an unprecedented rate.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea Ghez, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”In the latest study, the team analysed more than 13,000 observations of the black hole from 133 nights since 2003, gathered by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The black hole itself cannot be seen because it acts as a one-way trapdoor even for light. But it is possible to detect radiation blazing from gas and dust just outside the “event horizon” as they are accelerated towards their final fate.The team found that on 13 May the area just outside the black hole’s point of no return was twice as bright as the next brightest observation. They also observed large changes on two other nights this year, with all three of those changes being unprecedented, according to Ghez.The team also used a technique called speckle holography to reanalyse older, fainter observations dating back 24 years, from which they concluded that the level of brightness seen this year was unprecedented in the last quarter of a century.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase … and the rate of gas falling down the black hole drain has increased for an extended period, or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, a professor of physics and astronomy at UCLA and the paper’s co-senior author.One hypothesis is that the feeding frenzy is linked to the closest approach to the black hole of a star called S0-2 during the summer of 2018, and that a large quantity of gas from the star could have reached Sagittarius A* this year.Another possibility involves a bizarre object known as G2, which is most likely a pair of binary stars, which made its closest approach to the black hole in 2014. It is possible the black hole could have stripped off the outer layer of G2, Ghez said, which could help explain the increased brightness just outside the black hole. A third suggestion is that several large asteroids have been drawn into the cosmic sinkhole.The black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth and poses no danger to our planet. The findings appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/761323ea77f888b6cd420bfb0ddaa512b6f4b7fa/0_0_821_1152/master/821.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ed4c539aef6a10548344be99ed5287df 960w","title":"john marsden on the toxic parenting pandemic ive never seen this level of anxiety","story":"The Australian author and principal says it is becoming more difficult to run a school, with overprotective parents failing their childrenJohn Marsden has spent decades writing about, teaching and founding schools for young people – and lately, he has been getting worried. Really worried.In his new book about how we treat and understand children, Marsden – the author best known for his Tomorrow, When The World Began series – is in no mood for niceties about contemporary parenting. “We are seeing an epidemic of damaging parenting at the moment,” he writes.In The Art of Growing Up, billed as a manifesto, Marsden writes of the problematic state of parents being in love with their children, rather than loving them. He warns of parents playing eternal advocate for children who may not be as gifted or guileless as adults may like to imagine. He despairs at “curling parents” – the Scandinavian term for those who furiously clear all paths for their children. “Toxic parenting,” he writes, is having serious impacts.But are we engaged in “toxic parenting” en masse? Or is it just a case of extremes worsening?“No, I think this is a widespread problem,” Marsden says. “Damaging parenting,” he says, is not equivalent to emotional abuse, but rather represents an “ill-conceived and misguided” approach that is doing significant emotional damage.“It’s mostly the middle class that I’m referring to. It’s not that people are setting out to act destructively, but their common sense and instincts seem to have been overridden by other considerations. The emotional damage is coming from an anxiety which often approaches panic.”In the last five years, he says, it has become more difficult to run a school (he is principal and founder of two). And The Art of Growing Up does, at times, read much like the work of a principal who is fed up.Marsden says that this contemporary crop of teenagers is outperforming generations past in terms of academic achievement, political engagement and so on – but he is fearful about their emotional health, borne out by statistics on the prevalence of mental health issues among the young.“The scale of the problem is massive. The issue of emotional damage is pandemic,” he tells the . “The level of anxiety is something I’ve never seen before, and I don’t know how it can be improved.”Marsden says that much of the anxiety among parents and children springs from concern that the world is a dangerous place, with traditional “safe” authority figures no longer to be trusted. That, coupled with an infantilisation of children as pure, helpless creatures, leads parents to cosset and fret over their offspring, and demand much of the same from educational institutions.“Part of that is a fear, in particular, of physical injury,” he says. “Of course, all reasonable parents are concerned about physical injury to a child, but if that overrides everything else then what you have instead is a kind of slow death by emotional damage which is so awful to witness.”Marsden runs two private schools in Victoria, both housed on extensive bushland campuses. Children climb trees, ride bikes, camp and don’t wear uniforms. They are expensive schools to attend but Marsden believes all schools can address the “boring”, “antiseptic” lives of contemporary children and young people, lives which are lived primarily through second-hand experiences, he says, and devoid of grazed knees.“It’s ironic that in Australia, which has more free space than about anywhere in the world, children are put into school campuses which have recreation areas the size of a few basketball courts. And the rules are: you’re not allowed to run, you’re not allowed to touch other people, you’re not allowed to share food … you certainly can’t pick up a stick, you certainly can’t climb a tree.” He is incredulous.By limiting children’s exposure to danger, to fear, we are limiting their ability to mature, develop resilience and independence, he says. Marsden despairs at parents who don’t allow four-year-olds to peel their own mandarins. “They’re capable of helping themselves and we have to be forceful in making sure we step back.”And from the grace of childhood, so venerated by society, children inevitably fall when they become adolescents, demonised by finger-wagging elders. The feelings and experiences of these young people are too often trivialised, he says, while we constantly worry over exposure to sugar, screens and cyberbullies.Marsden doesn’t like to think in terms of optimism or pessimism. It’s a bit of a cop-out, relinquishing the optimist of the obligation to make the world better. And while he has no hesitation in labelling various parts of today’s parenting and childhood culture at crisis levels – attitudes and behaviours which can be linked to tragedies ranging from addiction to domestic violence – he won’t be drawn on whether what is happening today is more toxic than what has happened in the past.“We’re failing them in different ways,” he says. And, for Marsden, that’s not just good enough.• The Art of Growing Up by John Marsden is out 23 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317e7036c3a65f7f7d4e1da9a2e01af587040d19/870_21_2681_1609/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f052c1cbfafd11de8b2032ff8764657","title":"women better than men at disguising autism symptoms","story":"GPs would miss fewer diagnoses if ‘camouflaging’ was better understood, say researchersWomen may not be diagnosed with autism as frequently as men because they are better at hiding the common signs of the condition, according to new research.Some autistic people use strategies to hide traits associated with the condition during social interactions, a phenomenon called social camouflaging. Scientists involved in the study say raising awareness of camouflaging among doctors could help reduce the number of missed autism diagnoses.Scientists studied the results of an online survey designed to measure gender differences in camouflaging in autistic and non-autistic adults. They found autistic women exhibited more camouflaging behaviours than men, which supported previous observations from self-reported studies. No gender camouflaging differences were reported in non-autistic groups.“The effect wasn’t as big as we were expecting,” said Dr Will Mandy, from University College London, one of the authors of the study, published in the journal Autism and presented at the British Science Festival at the University of Warwick.“What I’m finding interesting is how ubiquitous camouflaging is. When you start to dig into why, it’s quite alarming for starters it’s experienced as an obligation rather than a choice. It’s very often about self-preservation, avoiding bullying or attack.”Common camouflaging behaviours include learning how to make eye contact, or suppressing urges to move in physical ways which some autistic people would find comforting, called stimming, for example rocking of the body or flapping of hands.Data from non-binary people and other genders was also studied and no behavioural differences were found, although the sample sizes of these groups were small.“Anyone who is alert to autism won’t be surprised by these findings,” said Hannah Hayward, a researcher on autism in women at King’s College London. “We find that for a lot of females, their autistic traits are not being picked up or recognised in the same way that males have been at school. This is because we’re trying to fit their diagnosis through the same moulds as males, but often they don’t fit that criteria because their presentation is slightly different.Laura Hull, from University College London and also an author on the study, hopes the work will lead to positive change. “If we can get awareness of social camouflaging into the NHS or Nice guidelines, and get it known how common it is in both men and women, that would be so important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d681223d384a542fb66ef6dd6efa913424e30fab/0_85_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d762074bcb1ec7ea383211fb4bb191d","title":"europe lead usa solheim cup marred slow play","story":"• Home side a point ahead after foursomes and fourballs• USA’s Lizette Salas warned for pace of her play at GleneaglesA 100-year-old woman earned social media stardom having impressed professionals with a few swings at this weekend’s Dutch Open on the European Tour. The joke goes that Susan Hosang was enjoying her 60s as the 16th Solheim Cup got under way at Gleneagles.A successful opening day for Europe was overshadowed by a curse of modern golf: slow play. The matter was particularly stark in the afternoon fourballs as the first match took five and a quarter hours until ending on the 16th green. Lizette Salas was singled out for a warning by officials but the unwillingness of those presiding to implement proper penalties is as recurring a theme as it is a depressing one. Salas did not appear worse than many others.Paul Lawrie, a former Open champion, enjoyed his visit to Gleneagles but spoke out about the “absolutely brutally slow” pace of play. Juli Inkster, the US captain, concurred. “It’s painfully slow out there,” she said.For television viewers, let alone those who had paid good money to spectate, this was borderline unwatchable. It is to the detriment of what should be a marquee sporting event that the scenario continued, and continued, and continued to the point where it was the key narrative. That Europe enter Saturday with a lead, four and a half to three and a half, seemed almost an afterthought.Captaincy can be defined by bold calls. Catriona Matthew would have been subject to criticism had Anne van Dam and Suzann Pettersen slumped to defeat instead this unlikely duo delivered a fourball showing which fully endorsed their captain’s faith.Van Dam, a Solheim Cup debutant, was nerveless as Salas and Danielle Kang were swatted aside by 4\u0026amp2. Pettersen had undertaken pre-tournament media duties while barely able to speak because of a throat problem the Norwegian was duly left out of the opening session. In Van Dam and Pettersen - the latter is playing in this event for the ninth time - Matthew had the perfect mix of youth and experience. Pettersen set the tone with a wonderful putt converted from 50ft at the 6th for a two. By the turn this European pair were four up, an irretrievable situation for the US.As Matthew celebrated the excellence of Van Dam and Pettersen, this proved a grisly Friday the 13th for Caroline Hedwall and Anna Nordqvist. The Swedes were demolished, 7\u0026amp5, by Angel Yin and Ally McDonald, matching a Solheim Cup record. McDonald is worthy of special praise she was an 11th-hour substitute here after the back injury suffered by Stacy Lewis.Europe took a one point lead into session two. And yet, the overwhelming stars of the foursomes show were American. The Korda sisters, Jessica and Nelly, thumped Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Caroline Masson 6\u0026amp4. Petr Korda, the golfers’ father and a former grand slam tennis champion, was among the Gleneagles galleries.The opening match of the competition was halved as Bronte Law and Carlota Ciganda could not be separated from Marina Alex and Morgan Pressel. Law and Ciganda earned another half point but were disappointed as Lexi Thompson holed a lengthy putt at the last to haul the Europeans back. Georgia Hall and Celine Boutier enjoyed a 2\u0026amp1 foursomes success over Thompson and Brittany Altomare. Hall and Boutier sat out the fourballs.Charley Hull’s fondness for this biennial competition was again apparent as she combined with Azahara Muñoz for a 2\u0026amp1 foursomes win over Megan Khang and Annie Park. In the fourballs Hull and Muñoz shared a point with Altomare and Nelly Korda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8cd5552efb0d0258fbdd118c803de7b52f0267/731_46_2881_1729/master/2881.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f667caef62032e68c2e9f2861179a8","title":"rugby world cup england joe cokanasiga wales wallabies","story":"Joe Cokanasiga has revealed he still suffers from pre-match nerves when playing for England, citing matches against Wales and Australia – both potential quarter-final opponents at the World Cup – as examples. Cokanasiga has scored five tries in his six England starts to date, bursting on to the scene last autumn and demonstrating why Eddie Jones fast-tracked him into the World Cup squad with a fine display against Ireland last month.The 21-year-old’s second cap came against the Wallabies last November and he has made three appearances against Wales in his short career so far but the 6ft 4in, 19st Cokanasiga has admitted he is plagued by self-doubt against the two teams England are most likely to face in the last eight at the World Cup, should they emerge from their pool.“I get quite nervous playing against the big teams like Australia and Wales, and sometimes I question myself whether I can do it,” he said. “But then once I’m in the game I’m back to my normal sense and just try to do what I do. Obviously I hate being nervous but it shows that you do care. But once that whistle goes, something just goes and you think: ‘I’m here for a reason’ so just try to show it. It’s gone pretty quickly for me. I haven’t really had time to think about it and process everything, but looking back it’s been a dream come true. Hopefully I can keep building on that.”As England continue their preparations in Miyazaki – Eddie Jones took his squad paddleboarding on Friday – South Africa’s World Cup buildup was rocked when it emerged Eben Etzebeth is being investigated by prosecutors over his involvement in an alleged assault and racial abuse during a bar brawl last month. Furthermore the former Springboks head coach Pieter de Villiers has said he will not be supporting South Africa at the World Cup because of the team’s handling of allegations. Etzebeth denies any wrongdoing.“By simply accepting Etzebeth’s word and not launching an investigation, SA Rugby missed an opportunity to show that they are serious about stamping out racism,” De Villiers told Planet Rugby. “I therefore cannot support the Springboks at this year’s World Cup.”New Zealand have also been dealt a blow with the news the flanker Luke Jacobson has been ruled out of the World Cup because of a delayed onset of concussion and will be replaced by Shannon Frizell. The 22-year-old Jacobson had played only 20 minutes off the bench against Argentina before he was named in the squad for the tournament.He came off the bench against Tonga on 7 September and did not suffer any problems until the All Blacks arrived in Japan and he developed symptoms after their first training session. “After discussing this latest episode with Luke, as well as our medical team, the decision has been made to, sadly, withdraw him from the tournament,” the All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, said. “We all felt the best thing for him to do is to take a break from rugby until he is symptom-free. While it was a tough conversation to have, ultimately it was a very simple decision. Luke’s health is the most important thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a66c4850fc3f3a8bffec96d3ada3ffd73ebcdf3c/0_155_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e44ae3017c5821040f2673a0507fc4","title":"wakefield london broncos super league match report","story":"• Wakefield Trinity 19-10 London Broncos• Ryan Hampshire’s double enough to save TrinityIt was billed as a night of drama and permutations aplenty: but in the end, the one result required to create any sort of tension failed to materialise. London Broncos deserve credit for taking this most remarkable of relegation battles to the final night of the season, but this was a step too far for a team who have defied the odds all season long.With London, Wakefield, Hull KR and Huddersfield separated by points difference alone coming into the final round, the most enthralling relegation battle in Super League history looked set for a dramatic finale on Friday the 13th. But by the time the Broncos had troubled the scorers here, their race - and one-season stay in the top-flight - was over.Late tries for Alex Walker and Brock Lamb added the hint of respectability London’s season-long spirit perhaps deserved, but by then, they were 19 points behind and, finally, cut adrift at the bottom of the table. “We’ve fallen at the final hurdle, but what an experience,” their coach, Danny Ward, said afterwards.Nobody gave the Broncos a chance of survival this season, and the fact they have been relegated with a record points tally of 20 underlines how competitive they have been in 2019. “We’ll regroup and we’ll get on with the rebuild and try get back,” Ward said. This was, in his own words, a game too far for this group: but while London fell short in their hour of need, how Wakefield rose to the occasion.Defeat here could have seen Trinity relegated depending on results elsewhere following a run of one win in 11 games, but they were near-perfect for the first 70 minutes here, establishing a comfortable 19-0 lead London never looked likely to overturn. “I couldn’t have asked for any more,” Chris Chester, the Wakefield coach, said. “It’s been the most challenging time of my coaching career.”Wakefield led 8-0 at half-time courtesy of a try for Ryan Hampshire and two goals from the boot of the outstanding Danny Brough. The 36-year-old was at the heart of everything Wakefield did well, and after Brough converted Hampshire’s second try to make it 14-0, his inch-perfect pass sent Reece Lyne over for another.The half-back then kicked the drop goal which, realistically, secured survival for the hosts - as well as Hull KR and Huddersfield, whose results elsewhere were irrelevant due to London’s shortcomings. Their late tries from Walker and Lamb underlined how they will be in the mix for an instant return to Super League next year, but for now, they must head back to the Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f69f2c68ac36afa7e4401a6f46487b70783602/0_74_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8055e9a1c3699929ebae44445749090c","title":"sam curran england ashes steve smith barney ronay","story":"As the shadows stretched out at the Oval on a lovely soft, drowsy Friday afternoon, something strange happened. Sam Curran took the ball from the Vauxhall End, paced out his comically furious run-up, and began to whistle up an unfamiliar kind of energy.Curran, with his 81mph full-pitch swingers, is an unlikely enforcer. But his outstanding quality is his intensity of purpose. Steve Smith fenced and was dropped by Joe Root. Tim Paine drove at an away-nibbler. Pat Cummins went lbw to another full, drifty hand grenade. Each time Curran came leaping down the pitch punching the air.Either side of this Jofra Archer produce another wonderful spell of hostile quick bowling, picking up his second six-for of the summer. Australia had been cruising midway through the afternoon. They were all out for 225 just after six o’clock. Too late perhaps, deep into a semi-dead rubber in early September. But this was without doubt England’s most forceful, aggressive session of the summer. Where has it been?Most of all, where has it been in the most vital phases, the Steve zone, those passages where Australia’s outstanding player has decided the destination of the urn? There is a theory that England have simply been too passive with Smith, distracted by his style, his mannerisms, his sheer annihilating brilliance.They took a first innings lead here. As ever, it might have been much more but for Smith. He came out to bat in mid-morning with the score on 14 for two. Archer was already bowling with fire and skill. At which point Smith began once again to drive and nudge and clip off his legs, shots played out of a state of pure sunlit calm.Later he stepped down to Jack Leach and heaved him over mid-on with all the carefree elan of a man hurling a broken vacuum cleaner into a builder’s skip. The shot brought up Smith’s 10th consecutive Ashes fifty. He waved his bat vaguely, bathed in the same unhurried, respectful sense of stillness.This has been the pattern. From Birmingham to London, England have not at any stage got stuck into Smith, have not been unduly hostile, have not greeted his arrival at the crease with a barrage of orchestrated hostility.It is a complaint many will reject out of hand. Matthew Wade was criticised, rightly perhaps, for his taunting of Archer in Manchester. Nobody likes a foghorn or a boor. English players have never been good at this sort of thing, which is a step outside of the national comfort zone.But still, faced with a man returning from a ban, a batsman who keeps 30 pairs of gloves in a carefully arranged row, England have not really tried to disturb him by nefarious means, never noticeably called him a cheat from short leg or stepped into his unusually ordered space.The absence of Jimmy Anderson has deprived this series of a fascinating duel, the master of English bowling v the master of England’s bowlers. But Anderson would have added bite too. A few tours back the simple act of repeatedly calling Mike Hussey “Dave” in the field – “shot Dave … played Dave … nice one Dave” – was enough to draw an angry reaction from one of Australia’s most relentlessly focused batsmen.Watching Smith here, stance ever more open, admiring the flow of the blade from its angle outside off stump into the most dreamily severe cover drive, the idea of disturbing those rhythms never really seemed to occur to the fielding team. Here is a batsman who has arranged the objects around him with a fussicky exactitude all summer, his game based on angles and planes and lines of impact. Trying something abrasive, disturbing, sandpapery, growling from short leg … well, why not?The odd thing is they did lay into Smith at Adelaide on the last Ashes tour, partly perhaps out of irritation at the Jonny Bairstow headbutt affair. The ball also moved in that match. Whatever the reason, Smith didn’t make it to fifty. Perhaps this time around the idea of leaving it to the crowd had crept in, along with the notion that a coterie of drunk middle-aged men in ballerina outfits represents genre-defining stadium hostility. Instead, England have simply looked on and ticked up the runs.Smith did make his lowest score of the series here, pinned in front by Chris Woakes for a mere 80 shortly after Curran’s burst and dismissed, for all of the above, by a leading contender for the title of nicest man in cricket.England will look back at this series and imagine how it might have played without Smith. It might be useful also to imagine what some more of this, a little more needle, a little more concerted aggression might have done to that obsessive, emasculating brilliance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f88197871caca107e011bd6488f054c294fe01d/30_91_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a162203af8d3c2e03ff4ad678f074c42","title":"talking horses hot favourite logician can land st leger doncaster horse racing tips","story":"The John Gosden-trained colt has won all four of his races and it is hard to see past him in the final Classic at DoncasterClarehaven Stables in Newmarket now houses an impressive number of horses who seem extremely hard to beat and Logician (3.35) is just the latest of them. The roan colt has won all four of his races and it is hard to see past him at Doncaster in Saturday’s final Classic, the St Leger.The son of Frankel did not have much of a public profile until his Great Voltigeur success at Glorious Goodwood last month but he has started favourite every time and it seems John Gosden and his team had a good idea that he would prove useful. He should be fine on this fast surface, which is likely to be a disadvantage for Technician. Sir Dragonet might also have preferred some cut.Il Paradiso’s form with Straarius makes him interesting but Logician is a worthy favourite. Victory on him may mean a lot to Frankie Dettori, who gained an important early success as an apprentice aboard the horse’s great, great grand-dam, Didicoy.1.50 Doncaster A huge amount of late ground was made up by Makanah when he was fourth in a similar race at the Ebor meeting. Having his first run back from a break, he was a lot further back in the early stages than he normally is and perhaps being slightly further forward here will enable him to get a better result. Julie Camacho’s four-year-old was allowed to start at 40-1 that day and still looks under-appreciated at 18-1 this time.2.05 Chester One win from 10 starts is a poor return for a horse with the ability of Ben Vrackie but this step back in trip gives him a chance, especially against a small field of rivals who have their own limitations. His narrow defeat in a Royal Ascot handicap off a mark of 104 is strong form in this context.2.25 Doncaster Shine So Bright was allowed his own way in front when scoring at York on his first run for more than three months but he is a short price considering this may not work out so helpfully. Turjomaan is an interesting alternative, having gone close in a Group Three at Glorious Goodwood, form which is working out well.2.45 Chelmsford Though Lethal Lunch ran out of room in the closing stages at Ascot last time, a return to the all-weather should see him resume his gradual improvement. Clive Cox’s grey went from last to first in a slow-run race at Kempton last month and has more to offer.3.00 Doncaster This renewal of the Champagne Stakes seems a bit short on quality and could be straightforward for the Gimcrack winner, Threat, who has been keeping good company all summer. Juan Elcano has pace but the form of his Newmarket second in July has not stood up well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/272a966f6509cc673a935e7a678008207427a568/198_1271_1628_976/master/1628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd40e6d1d00f1ae6c0fe4c836f87362","title":"sofie hagen the bumswing review","story":"Soho theatre, LondonThe standup riffs on the oddness of memory in a show that takes in Danish queens, Welsh sex breaks and a late gutpunchSofie Hagen’s last three shows – including her award-winning debut Bubblewrap – mined personal trauma for comedy. Which wasn’t quite as therapeutic as she’d hoped. So The Bumswing heralds a course correction: it’s “a fun show, a light show”, Hagen promises, about a “sex weekend” in south Wales. There certainly is fun on offer, and lightness too, even if the Danish comic’s opening manifesto is not to be taken entirely on trust.The fun is top-loaded: The Bumswing starts with tongue-in-cheek boasting about the relative virtues of the Danish and British queens. Hagen then tees up a running gag about decorous UK email etiquette, which yields reliable laughs throughout the show. The anecdote we’ve been promised – about her dirty Welsh weekend with an older man – never really gets going, partly because Hagen suffers from a patchy memory of that event and others. This imperfect recall – how it works, and why – emerges as theshow’s true subject.It’s tricksy territory for autobiographical performance and the 60-minute set folds in and out of what Sofie remembers and what actually happened. The ground is unsteady beneath our feet – and hers – as the facts behind her phantom strawberry allergy are revealed and a heckler picks at obvious holes in the story of her Swansea sex tour. Where does it leave comedy audiences when our narrator is this unreliable – even to herself?It leaves us laughing, sometimes – and extram conscious of doing so, because Hagen is recording the gig, and the soundwave image (high peaks for laughter flatline for silences) is displayed downstage. Suffice to say it remains horizontal when a closing revelation upends what we thought we were getting from The Bumswing.It packs a punch, this climax – particularly in light of Hagen’s earlier comments about performing her trauma. And it’s capped by a fine visual gag. But it did leave me wondering what the show’s getting at, and about the wisdom of deploying this kind of information as dramatic twist in the tail. It’s a knotty show, which asks: whither autobiographical comedy when the autobiography is riddled with holes that may be neither light nor fun to look into?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8ce649acfbca3f81f5bdea813d3539e96964d6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e19f7274850548f7e0e82fba10d6f59","title":"google facebook amazon apple big tech house judiciary committee","story":"The US government’s investigations into big tech widened on Friday as lawmakers announced they were seeking internal documents from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.Letters went out to the four companies on Friday from the leaders of the House judiciary committee and its subcommittee on antitrust, which has been conducting a sweeping antitrust investigation of the companies and their effect on competition and consumers.Among the dozens of executives named in the requests are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Google’s Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt.Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, said: “The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online.“But there is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications.”The investigation represents a rare example of bipartisan cooperation.Doug Collins, the senior Republican on the House committee, said: “This information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets.”The investigation is likely to lead to the release of potentially embarrassing internal documents and high-profile public hearings involving some of the biggest names in tech.The letters seek information about the ways in which the tech giants have built their businesses, how they shape the search results that consumers see and how other businesses interact with their services.The companies have said they’ll cooperate fully with the congressional investigation.The lawmakers set a 14 October deadline for the companies to provide the documents.Nadler said the documents will help the committee understand “whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition.”The justice department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are also conducting investigations of the companies. The latest moves come after dozens of US states launched privacy and antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a418a879bcc0ff139a65ce462c120443a1b3f393/0_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=728c0b02f4aef5dd4198c4f249629332","title":"youtube vanlifer jennelle eliana blazes trail solo female travellers","story":"Lo-fi videos about life on the road also fill blindspot travel industry has in catering for women of colourThe YouTube channel of a 21-year-old woman who lives in a van with her pet snake Alfredo is at the centre of a debate about race, travel and gender in the online world.Jennelle Eliana’s channel, which documents her day-to-day existence as a “vanlifer”, has become an internet phenomenon after gaining 1.9 million subscribers since June.“It really can happen overnight,” said Emily Hall, the campaign director at the Goat Agency, a marketing firm centred on social media influencers. “The interest in her is fuelled by the lifestyle that she’s putting out. If someone makes an alternative lifestyle look attainable and stands out on socials they can take off massively.”Eliana’s videos are simple and edited on her smartphone, with the 21-year-old showing subscribers around her converted 1995 GMC Vandura van and talking through the practicalities of life on the road, from taking a shower to dealing with break-ins.Her sudden rise led to conspiracy theories about how she became so popular so quickly. Chris Stokel-Walker, a journalist and author of YouTubers: How YouTube Shook Up TV and Created a New Generation of Stars, said although her rise has been meteoric, it is a lack of understanding around how the platform works that is fuelling the sceptics.“There is a dearth of information about how recommendations work on YouTube, so people assume it’s a manufactured success when it’s not,” he said. “She has that intangible mix of being cool and outdoorsy with a sense of adventure, coupled with an engaging and quirky personality. It’s that Beach Boys aesthetic meets Jack Kerouac but for 2019.”“Since 2016, uploads with ‘solo travel’ in the title have steadily increased year over year with 2019 proving to be the largest year yet,” said a YouTube spokesperson. “This year, out of the top 100 most viewed videos with ‘solo travel’ in the title, over 70 were uploaded by women.”The appeal to her Generation Z peers has been attributed to her lo-fi production values and focus on the more unglamorous sides of travel, according to the tech journalist Taylor Lorenz, who has written about Eliana. Her videos also chime with a move toward less manufactured, “authentic” online content favoured by younger viewers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.“It’s representative of an entire generation sticking their middle finger up to what women ‘should’ be doing,” said Eve Young, co-host of the Social Minds podcast. “The popularity of solo female travel is a real sign of the times: it connotes freedom, choice, financial independence and confidence.”Eliana’s sudden rise fits another emerging trend in the number of black women creating solo travel videos on YouTube. The platform says there are a “notable number of videos” from black female creators sharing their experiences of travelling among the most viewed in the solo travel category.The journalist Georgina Lawton says Eliana’s vlog and others like it fill a blindspot that the travel industry has traditionally had around catering for women of colour.“We’ve consistently been seen as a monolith by the UK travel industry,” said Lawton, , who is writing a guide to solo travel for women of colour. “Now when someone does something like Jennelle Eliana with her vanlife videos, it breaks the mould and it appeals to so many more people who think they can do it.”Lawton says she was inspired by Oneika Raymond, who started out as a vlogger before becoming a host on the Travel Channel. Part of the appeal for her of content made by black solo female travellers such as Oneika is that it helps bust myths about alternative forms of travel.“It’s nice when other people have made content because that alleviates my own fears,” said Lawton, who watched videos by other black solo female travellers before a trip to Russia. “I ask myself, what is the reception going to be like for a minority? These videos answer those questions.”“People are starting to recognise that YouTube is so massive that you can build a niche that people identify with,” said Stokel-Walker. “The thing is a niche interest on YouTube still means millions of views.”The interesting thing for him is what will happen next. He says Eliana and other successful YouTubers will quickly have to choose whether to accept commercial offers or reject them in order to retain their original appeal.“They build their audience on authenticity and then they get to a level when they become almost a traditional celebrity,” said Stokel-Walker, who expects brands to start throwing offers at Eliana. “And then the original appeal gets a lot harder to maintain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee6ea5e68ddd5999bccc2fd4ed3908e7317985db/1_0_5594_3357/master/5594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7ea7346066eec828a9c2b32c7929a5b","title":"turkish tv magnificent century dizi taking over world","story":"Shows such as Magnificent Century have come to rival US TV for international popularity, sweeping through the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. What explains their global success? By  Fatima Bhutto‘The first agreement we should make is: don’t call them soap operas,” Dr Arzu Ozturkmen, who teaches oral history at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, scolds me. “We are very much against this.” What Turkey produces for television are not soap operas, or telenovelas, or period dramas: they are dizi. They are a “genre in progress”, declares Ozturkmen, with unique narratives, use of space and musical scores. And they are very, very popular.Thanks to international sales and global viewership, Turkey is second only to the US in worldwide TV distribution – finding huge audiences in Russia, China, Korea and Latin America. At present, Chile is the largest consumer of dizi in terms of number of shows sold, while Mexico, then Argentina, pay the most to buy them.Dizi are sweeping epics, with each episode usually running to two hours or longer. Advertising time is cheap in Turkey and the state broadcasting watchdog mandates that every 20 minutes of content be broken up by seven minutes of commercials. Every dizi has its own original soundtrack, and can have up to 50 major characters. They tend to be filmed on location in the heart of historic Istanbul, using studios only when they must.Dizi storylines, which have covered everything from gang rape to scheming Ottoman queens, are “Dickens and the Brontë sisters”, I am told by Eset, a young Istanbul screenwriter and film-maker. “We tell at least two versions of the Cinderella story per year on Turkish TV. Sometimes Cinderella is a 35-year-old single woman with a child sometimes she’s a 22-year-old starving actress.” Eset, who worked on perhaps the most famous dizi, Magnificent Century, recounts the narrative themes that dizi are usually loyal to:Dizi are built, Eset insists, on the altar of “communal yearning”, both for the audience and the characters. “We want to see the good guy with the good girl, but, dammit, life is bad and there are bad characters around.”According to Izzet Pinto, the founder of the Istanbul-based Global Agency, which bills itself as the “world’s leading independent TV content distributor for global markets”, the upward course of dizi imperialism began with 2006’s Binbir Gece (1001 Nights). At the time, another Turkish show, Gümüs (Silver), was already a hit in the Middle East, but it was 1001 Nights that became a truly global success. Wherever 1001 Nights was sold – in almost 80 countries – it was a ratings smash.The show featured a blue-eyed Turkish dreamboat, Halit Ergenç, who would go on to star in the lead role of Magnificent Century. Based on the life of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 10th Ottoman Sultan, Magnificent Century told the story of the sultan’s love affair with a concubine named Hurrem, whom he married, in a major break with tradition. A largely unknown historical figure, Hurrem is believed to have been an Orthodox Christian from modern-day Ukraine.When it first aired in Turkey in 2011, Magnificent Century claimed one-third of the country’s TV audience. The foreign press called it an “Ottoman-era Sex and the City” and compared it to a real-life Game of Thrones. It had multiple historical consultants and a production team of 130, with 25 people working on costumes alone.Magnificent Century was so popular in the Middle East that Arab tourism to Istanbul skyrocketed. Turkey’s minister of culture and tourism even stopped charging certain Arab countries broadcasting fees. Global Agency estimates that, even without counting its most recent buyers in Latin America, Magnificent Century has been seen by more than 500 million people worldwide. It was the first dizi bought by Japan. Since 2002, about 150 Turkish dizi have been sold to more than 100 countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Bulgaria. It was Magnificent Century that blazed the way for others to follow.The international success of such dizi is just one sign of the way new forms of mass culture from the east – from Bollywood to K-pop – are challenging the dominance of American pop culture in the 21st century. Ergenç feels that the runaway success of the dizi is partly due to the fact that American TV is entertaining, but not moving. “They don’t touch the feelings that make us human,” he tells me, nursing a cold cup of coffee, when we meet in Istanbul. Turkey’s gaze was once keenly turned to the west, studying its films and television for clues about how to behave in a modern, fast-paced world, but today, American shows offer little guidance. “I was thinking of one American TV series – let’s not say its name. The philosophy of the series was being lonely. Being, um … ” – he searches for the polite word – “multi-partner at the same time, and searching for happiness. And all the people who were watching those series were very excited about it.” I can only guess he is referring to Sex and the City, but Ergenç doesn’t say. “That’s a tiring thing, isn’t it? Being alone, changing partners quickly and searching for happiness, and each time you search for it, it’s a failure. But it was in a very fancy world, so people were very interested. They’re spending and spending – spending their time, spending their love, spending everything.”The dizi that became global behemoths were powered by narratives that pitted traditional values and principles against the emotional and spiritual corruption of the modern world. Fatmagül’ün Suçu Ne? (What Is Fatmagül’s Fault?) centered on the gang rape of a young girl named Fatmagül and her battle for justice. It was a huge hit in Argentina, and in Spain its primetime slot drew close to a million viewers per episode. Fatmagül is soon to get a full Spanish telenovela remake, adapted to a daily, half-hour afternoon format.The show addresses a woman’s place in society, while subjecting her to myriad problems, from forced marriage to tense family relations to the suffocating power of the rich. But Fatmagül perseveres. She educates herself and defeats every hardship as she fights for, and receives, justice on all fronts: civil justice through the nation’s courts, ine justice through the punishment of her violators – and, of course, the justice of true love.Although dizi have dealt with abuse, rape and honour killings, by and large, Turkish men are portrayed as more romantic than Romeo. “They show people what they want to see,” Pinar Celikel, an Istanbul fashion editor tells me. “It’s not real.” Yet Eset argued that Fatmagül was groundbreaking in its approach to women’s issues. Previously, agents of change and the heroes of dizi stories were always men, but “Fatmagül didn’t accept women’s place as being subjugated, almost invisible”.It was such a persuasive vehicle for soft power that in 2012, Eset was hired by a “Republican American thinktank” to write a dizi telling the “good American story” of a woman in the Middle East out to enact positive change, “a woman who softens America’s image”. Eset declines to say which thinktank commissioned him, except to hint that a former Bush administration undersecretary was involved with the institute. “I wrote it,” Eset shrugs as he rolls a cigarette. “But they weren’t able to sell it.”I am standing in the drizzle in a bleak parking lot on the Asian side of Istanbul in front of a white van. A man named Ferhat hands me a Glock 19 pistol. It is the same model Turkish soldiers use, he says, as he swings open the van doors. Inside, there is a rocket-launcher lying on the floor and about 60 other weapons hanging on racks. Ferhat, who is ex-military, pulls out a “bad guy rifle” – an AK-47 – and a sniper rifle. Men in military uniform prowl across the parking lot. All around us there are street signs in Arabic and extras in cheap suits.We are on the set of Söz (The Oath), a new show made by Tims Productions, the company behind Magnificent Century. They are filming episode 38. A demolition expert saunters by, chatting to a man in a balaclava while an actor rehearses a scene, holding a rifle in each hand. Söz is a military dizi – a new sub-genre that is sweeping the nation. Although it is too early to have a sense of its global effect, Söz has already received remake offers from faraway markets including Mexico. Tims has always had an international outlook, I am told. They tried to cast Hollywood stars for Magnificent Century, and were reportedly close to signing Demi Moore to play a European princess until her orce from Ashton Kutcher got in the way.Of the five major channels in Turkey, each has one of these “soldier-glorifying” shows, Eset the screenwriter tells me later, and all the shows are “zeitgeist-relevant”. The baddies are either “internal enemies” or foreign villains. Söz takes place in a Turkey beset by violence and existential threats. Soldiers are everywhere, blazing through the wreckage of suicide bombings at shopping malls and hunting terrorists who are hard at work kidnapping pregnant women. In the first episode, after an attack on a mall, a soldier promises they will not rest until “we drain this swamp” – an eerily familiar refrain.Five minutes on the streets of Istanbul presents multiple encounters with women in headscarves, yet they are nowhere to be seen on screen. “They tried it,” Eset says, “but even the conservative folks don’t like to see conservative women on TV. You can’t get them to kiss, to stand up to their fathers, to run away, to do very much at all that would be considered drama.” Women in hijabs are almost never shown in television adverts, the journalist and novelist Ece Temelkuran tells me. Her diagnosis was clear: “This country is torn between these two pieces of cloth – flag and headscarf.”Back on the Söz set, as we move upstairs to a cold office building to watch a man pick up a phone for an hour while the demolition guys shoot glass windows in the corridor, I tell Selin Arat – director of international operations at Tims, and my guide for the day – that I watched an episode of Söz the previous night. Every time I looked down at my notebook, I explain, by the time I looked up again, everyone in the scene seemed to have been murdered. Who are the terrorists supposed to be? Arat, a delicate, strawberry-blond woman in a business suit, laughs. “It would be life-threatening if we knew who they were,” she jokes.Whoever the terrorists are, Söz is a hit. “It’s the first Turkish show that has surpassed one million subscribers on YouTube,” Arat notes proudly. Selling Söz outside Turkey may prove tougher, though. “We do want this show to be global,” says Timur Savcı, the founder of Tims Productions. “But right now not many countries are really interested in watching Turkish soldiers be glorified.” He pauses and smiles. “The US always makes shows and, at the end, they say: ‘God bless America.’ Well, God bless Turkey!”Savcı sits at his desk in the Levent district of Istanbul, as five TVs, all tuned to different channels, illuminate his spacious office. He sets the tone for the dizi industry at large and, today, he is preparing an English adaptation of Magnificent Century. He is not the least bit interested in taking American shows and remaking them in Turkish. “We are just making originals. It’s better!” he says with a big laugh.Dizi have yet to penetrate the English-speaking world. That could be because audiences in the US and UK don’t like to watch subtitled shows, Savcı muses, “or it could be the fact that this is about an Islamic state at the end of the day.” I ask if that is something Tims would tone down in the English version of Magnificent Century? Savcı, a jaunty, jovial man, shakes his head. “It’s important to remember that, at the time, the Ottoman Empire was the superpower of the world. What the US is now to the world is what the Ottoman was. If people look at it from this perspective, they would understand it more, but if they don’t know this, they would feel threatened.”Turks have been watching quality US TV since the 1970s. Turkish actors, such as Mert Fırat, told me they learned all their chops from the likes of Dallas and Dynasty. That was where they learned to emote, and to perform the melodrama that dizi require. But there was something lacking, something fundamental missing from those early guides to how to be rich and powerful in the modern world.Kivanç Tatlıtuğ, the star of the hit dizi Gümüs, among others, doesn’t feel it is necessarily a question of values or conservatism, but empathy. Over email, he told me why he thinks audiences around the world are turning to dizi over western productions. “Most of these audiences feel that their everyday stories are ‘underexplored’ by Hollywood and Europe,” Tatlıtuğ wrote. “This is ultimately a matter of ersity in storytelling. I understand the appeal of a story like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, these are both amazing TV shows. However, some people may also feel disenfranchised from these Hollywood themes, and may want to watch a story they can empathise with.”At the time of our meeting, Eset is working with a Turkish-American production house, Karga 7, which has global ambitions for their shows.“When I talk to people about Turkish TV series,” he tells me, “mainly they are taken by this romantic notion of family where everyone is trying to cherish one another. The dangers are external, and socio-economic class plays a great role in the love story of the poor boy loving a rich girl, or vice versa. Normally a story like this in the west would be treated through an inidual’s journey, where there is more sex, there is more violence, there are drugs.” Turkish TV has less of that. He points out that the couple in Fatmagül don’t kiss until about episode 58.In August 2017 in Beirut, I speak to Fadi Ismail, the general manager of the Middle East Broadcasting Center’s subsidiary O3 Productions, and the person responsible for bringing Turkish television to the Middle East. “To brag a bit,” Ismail corrects me with a laugh, “I’m the one who opened Turkish culture through TV to the whole world.” MBC is the biggest broadcaster in the Middle East and North Africa, home to almost 400 million people. MBC has a news channel, a children’s channel, a women’s channel, a Bollywood channel and a 24-hour drama channel on which it broadcasts Egyptian soaps, Korean dramas and Latin American telenovelas.In 2007, Ismail went to a buyer’s cinema festival in Turkey and chanced upon a tiny kiosk showing a local television series. “I stopped and watched it, not understanding anything,” he remembers. “But immediately I could visualise it as Arabic content. I replaced it in my mind with Arabic audio and everything else looked culturally, socially – even the food, the clothes, everything for me looked like us, and I thought: ‘Eureka!’”Ismail bought a Turkish series for his channel. He doesn’t remember the name of that first show, because they had already hit on the formula of giving everything – the title, the characters – new Arabic names. “Every one of these titles had ‘love’ in it, so I stopped differentiating. Love Something, Blue Love, Long Love, Short Love, Killing Love.” Gümüs – renamed Noor for the Middle East market – was the first big hit. Although the Egyptians had traditionally been known for their cinema, they also dominated TV across the region until Syria took over in the 1990s. Syrian actors were renowned for their dramatic and comedic skills. Their directors were artists. Talented scriptwriters produced shows of quality with substantial state help. The government poured money into the television industry, providing auteurs with cameras, equipment, state subsidies and permission to film in Syria’s historic sites. But then the war broke out and the country’s bright promise flickered. It was at this moment, Ismail says, that the Turks were ready to move in.As Syrian dramas had already become a “pan-Arab phenomenon”, MBC decided to dub all the Turkish dramas they bought into the Syrian Arabic dialect. “That is one of the reasons for their huge success,” Ismail concludes. “We dubbed the Turkish dramas with the most prevalent and established drama accent: Syrian.” Before Turkish dramas flooded Middle Eastern screens, people in Lebanon watched Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas. Though they were popular, they eventually ran out of steam for two reasons. The first was language. Telenovelas were dubbed into fusha, a standardised literary Arabic that is understood from Iraq to Sudan, and is used in newspapers, magazines and newscasts. Free from local accents and slang particular to each country, it is a formal, classical Arabic.The second was a question of values. “The Mexicans really did not resemble us at all,” says Imane Mezher, the format distribution and licensing coordinator of iMagic, a Beirut-based TV production company. iMagic makes Arabs Got Talent and the Middle East version of the X Factor, and experiments with new formats such as World Bellydance Championship, and an Islamically approved Extreme Makeover in which contestants don’t alter God’s design out of vanity, but have reconstructive surgery due to life-threatening issues.Mezher shakes her head at the memory of the telenovelas. “You have a daughter and you don’t know who her father is, you don’t know who the mother is. The stories were moral-free. At the end of the day, like it or not, we like things to be a little more conservative. The Turks are amazing at that. They are the real mix: the European freedom that everyone longs for and, at the same time, the problems are conservative, the same we face. The people have the same names as us, the same stories as us, and people love that.”Yet over the past 18 months, the international reach of Turkish TV has been significantly curtailed. At 1am, Saudi Arabian time on 2 March 2018, MBC took dizi off the air. Six dizi were pulled, at a cost to MBC of $25m. “There is a decision to remove all Turkish drama from several TV outlets in the region,” the channel’s spokesman said. “I can’t confirm who took the decision.”Since 2015, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been in negotiations to buy MBC, but found the $3bn asking price too high. In November 2017, MBS, as he is known, arrested most of MBC’s board and shareholders as part of what was billed as an anti-corruption sweep. After an 83-day stay in a luxury jail, MBC’s founder Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman whose sister was married to a former king, was released. His company now had a secret new majority owner, whose first order of business was to cancel all of MBC’s dizi programming.Before then, the Middle East and North Africa region accounted for the largest international consumption of dizi. Magnificent Century was advertised alongside Game of Thrones and Oprah in Dubai, while Ece Yörenç – Fatmagül’s scriptwriter – was asked by Saudi Arabia to write TV series for its local channels, and rumours circulated of princes and politicians inquiring after show plotlines during state visits to Turkey. It is possible that this kind of Turkish soft power irked MBS. And it is certain that he was infuriated by Turkey’s brazen flouting of his 2017 blockade of Qatar. Thus, in March 2018, MBS accused Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of trying to build a new “Ottoman caliphate”, included Turkey in what he bizarrely called a “triangle of evil”, and swiftly erased dizi from Middle Eastern TV.It is impossible to separate politics, both internal and geopolitical, from dizi’s upward momentum. Erdoğan himself was famously antagonistic to Magnificent Century, finding it too risque and not sufficiently versed in true Ottoman history. His government withdrew permission for its producers to film in historical sites such as Topkapı Palace, and Turkish Airlines pulled it from its in-flight entertainment systems in order to avoid government ire. A deputy from Erdoğan’s AKP party even went so far as to submit a parliamentary petition to legally ban the show.Although Magnificent Century has never been used by the state to project Turkish soft power to the world, other dizi have. Two more recent productions for TRT, Turkish state television, have the government’s wholehearted endorsement, if not their guidance. The first, Diriliş: Ertuğrul, or Resurrection: Ertuğrul, begins at the start of Ottoman glory, with Ertuğrul Ghazi, the father of Sultan Osman, the founder of the empire. The dizi’s tagline is “A nation’s awakening”, and for five seasons viewers have watched Ertuğrul battle crusaders, Mongols, Christian Byzantines and more. It has the honour of being the most popular show to air on state TV. “Until the lions start writing their own stories,” Erdoğan said of Ertuğrul, “their hunters will always be the heroes.”Another show, Payitaht Abdülhamid or The Last Emperor, bookends the Ottoman obsession: it is based on the last powerful Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II. It first aired in 2017, drawing in big numbers – every Friday, one in 10 television watchers tuned in as the sultan staved off rebellions by the Young Turks (who would eventually unseat him) and scheming European powers. Both supporters and detractors of the dizi pointed out that its portrayal of the sultan was modelled incredibly closely on Erdoğan. Followers of the Turkish president saw symbiosis between the two proud leaders who were unafraid to confront the west, and who dreamed of making Turkey central to pan-Muslim unity. Critics pointed out the two men’s paranoid reliance on intelligence services and an oppressive grip on power.By 2023, the Turkish government hopes dizi will pull in $1bn from exports. In his Istanbul glass office, İzzet Pinto, the founder of dizi distributor Global Agency, told me that $500m is a more realistic target given the loss of the Middle East market. But he foresees that remake rights, expansion in Latin America and the opening of western Europe – notably Italy and Spain – will help offset those losses.Over at Tims, Selin Arat predicts that Turkish series have reached a stable level of popularity. Demand might not grow much more, but there is a global hunger for what Turkish TV can offer. Arat concedes that the Saudi stance against dizi is a setback, but, he says: “It won’t be the end of the Turkish dizi invasion.”Adapted from New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop by Fatima Bhutto, published on 10 October by Columbia Global Reports, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715bd29e54ad6b80708c51bf151c73aefc89b3d8/0_82_1167_699/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2504b11f8df1da6b8bb6567ef973cb24","title":"jeffrey epstein harvard donations","story":"Harvard University received nearly $9m in donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before his 2008 guilty plea to sex charges, but rejected a proposed gift after his conviction, according to the institution’s president, Lawrence Bacow.The largest of Epstein’s gifts to the university was $6.5m in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Other gifts totaled about $2.4m. Epstein did not attend Harvard.Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August after being arrested on sex trafficking charges of young women and girls. His arrest triggered a national examination of his position in an elite social circle of rich, powerful people across the arts, sciences and politics.In a message to Harvard students and staff, Bacow, who took over as president in June, condemned Epstein crimes as “repulsive and reprehensible” and said he “profoundly regrets Harvard’s past association with him”.He said: “Epstein’s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors.”After a review of Harvard’s relationship with Epstein ordered two weeks ago, Bacow said the university still had $186,000 in funds from the earlier donations, which will now be given to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.Harvard’s disclosure comes a day after the university’s newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, condemned the school for what it called a “deafening silence” on the matter.“Harvard must further recognize that accepting a donation at a given point in time not only legitimates the donor’s reputation, but also implicitly condones what they stand for in perpetuity, unless the university takes clear, decisive action to demonstrate the contrary,” the Crimson’s editorial board wrote.The disclosure that Harvard declined Epstein’s contributions after he was convicted for soliciting a minor are in marked contrast to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and its Media Lab, which has been rocked by revelations that it accepted more than $7.5m in donations from Epstein or people connected to the university through him after his conviction.Amid a review of Epstein donations to MIT, the university’s president, Rafael Reif, acknowledged Thursday he apparently thanked Epstein in a note in 2012 in response to one donation.Bacow, in his message, also noted that Harvard had recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, had designated Epstein as a visiting fellow in the psychology department in 2005.“We are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr Kosslyn, who no longer works at the university,” Bacow said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f399b0f4acb7c17c83f660565bbaae3294d67e3f/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad307f4624da008445a04f8689e24c9","title":"ship of horrors deep sea fishing oyang 70 new zealand","story":"From bullying and sexual assault to squalid living conditions and forced labour, working at sea can be a grim business – and one deep-sea fishing fleet is particularly notorious. By  Ian UrbinaOn the night of 14 August 2010, the captain of a South Korean trawler, the Oyang 70, left Port Chalmers, New Zealand, for what would be his final journey. The ship was bound for fishing grounds about 400 miles east in the southern Pacific Ocean. When it arrived three days later, the captain, a 42-year-old man named Shin Hyeon-gi, ordered his crew to cast the net over the vessel’s rusty stern. As the men worked furiously on the illuminated deck, the ship soon began hoisting in thousands of pounds of a lithe, slender fish called southern blue whiting, which writhed and flapped across the deck. With each haul, the silvery mound of fish grew.A type of cod, blue whiting was sometimes ground up into fish sticks or imitation lobster. More often it was pelletised and sold as protein-rich food for farmed carnivorous fish such as salmon. At about 9¢ per pound, blue whiting was a low-price catch, which meant the Oyang 70 had to catch a lot to make a profit. As the crew pulled in the net, tonne after tonne of the fish slid to the deck – 39,000kg in all, a decent haul.The battered, 74 metre ship was long past its prime. The average age for distant-water fishing boats in the South Korean fleet was 29, and the Oyang 70 was 38 years old. Port captains called it “tender” – a euphemism for unstable. A month before it set sail, a New Zealand inspector ranked the ship as “high risk”, citing more than a dozen safety violations, including the fact that one of the ship’s main doors below deck was not watertight. The inspector later cleared the ship to sail after its operator claimed that all problems had been fixed.One of the Oyang’s unsolved problems was the man at the helm. Shin had replaced the previous captain, who fell overboard in a drunken stupor and drowned. When the ship cast its first net that day, Shin had been at the helm for nine months. Former crew members referred to him as an “angry man” – sullen, prone to screaming and almost always carrying around a bottle of clear liquid. Deckhands debated whether it was water or grain alcohol. None was reckless enough to ask.Shin drove his men hard. As the first net was pulled that night, they sorted the squirming, oily mound on the aft deck, quickly heaving the fish down a chute to the ship’s interior to make space for the next haul.One floor down, in the ship’s factory, more than a dozen men stood cramped before the “slime line”, a conveyor belt, wielding knives and operating circular saws. Their job was to remove heads, guts and bycatch, while the valuable part of the fish continued down the line for packing and freezing. The men needed roughly half a day to fully process the first catch. But before they made it through the load, Shin ordered the men on deck to put the net back in the water. Work continued almost nonstop over the next 24 hours.At about 3am on 18 August, the ship’s first mate frantically roused Shin from his sleep. The net was too full, the first mate told him. It was pulling the boat under. Water in the engine room was already several feet deep. The crew on deck was begging to cut the net.The captain jumped from his bunk and raced to the bridge. But instead of ordering the net cut, he demanded that the bosun, the man in charge of the deckhands, command them to keep hoisting. That order would be Shin’s last.For the Sajo Oyang Corporation, which operated the vessel, the poor treatment of workers and the dismal condition of its ship was nothing unusual. Time and again, Sajo Oyang abused its crew members, often treating them with the same disregard as the bycatch in its nets – as a distraction and annoyance. Sometimes, that disregard cost men their lives. The infamy of the Sajo Oyang fleet was well known in maritime circles.The vastness of the seas made it difficult to chase down bad actors – finding the criminals in the first place was often impossible. What stood out about the story of the Oyang ships was that safety risks and violations, and the persistent mistreatment of workers, were hiding in plain sight. But at every turn, inspectors and regulators largely shrugged off their responsibilities, often with a crass disdain for the lives at stake. Aside from the eight Korean officers, the crew of the Oyang 70 consisted of 36 Indonesians, six Filipinos and one Chinese. The officers derided the Muslims on board as “dogs” or “monkeys”. The drinking water was often brown and tasted of metal, workers would later tell investigators and lawyers. After a certain point, the only food on board for the crew was rice and the fish they caught. Men were docked pay if they ate too slowly. The crew described the ship as “a floating freezer” the heater on board barely worked. The shared toilet lacked running water. There were so many cockroaches that a crew member later said he could smell them cooking as they fell on to the hot engine block.The Oyang 70 was known as a stern trawler, towing a long, cylindrical net from behind. The ship’s most intense work happened in the dark, because blue whiting is a schooling fish that lives near the seabed, and is more easily caught at night, when it feeds on plankton, small shrimp and krill closer to the surface.As the crew struggled with the net on 18 August, everyone on board knew it was more fish than the boat could handle. No one knew by how much, though, because there were no batteries in the net’s weight sensors. The cost of replacing the ship’s trawl net was more than $150,000. The price of losing a net full of fish would be the captain’s job.As the net was winched up the stern ramp in the early morning darkness, it looked like a monstrous whale. At the chute, the net mouth opened and the whale regurgitated a flood of fish, so much that the hold soon clogged. The closed end, or “cod” end, of the net stretched down into the sea behind them. Trailing the ship, this mesh cylinder stretched nearly 30 metres. At the far end underwater, the net bulged to cover an area the size of six tennis courts. More than five tonnes of fish were on the ship’s slipway, while around another 100 tonnes remained underwater – easily worth more than $20,000.Other captains would later testify that this catch was more than double the size of a “bag” that they would have been willing to pull on to a ship of its size. Behind the ship, the bloated net began dragging the Oyang 70’s rudder deep underwater, jutting its bow awkwardly toward the inky sky.Most captains would have immediately identified how dangerous the situation had become. It takes a rare, almost instinctual calm and spatial acuity to steady a ship of this size while reading the tides, countering gusts and directing a dozen men scrambling on deck. This is especially true when hoisting a large, heavy net, which has to be carefully centered behind the ship.Shin lacked this instinct. He was not calm, nor was his ship stable in the best of circumstances, and certainly not when his net suddenly slipped to the port side, abruptly tipping the Oyang 70 to a 15-degree list. In the factory below deck, the men on the slime line continued working, even as the ship tilted and as the water rose to their knees. In a desperate attempt to right the ship, Shin ordered some of the men to move any heavy equipment they could budge to starboard and tether it there.But the list remained, and water began rushing in through the open “offal chute”, a port-side door for expelling fish guts and heads into the ocean. At the same time, dead fish and debris clogged the ship’s scuppers, trapping on board the water that should have drained off. The door to the engine room below, which also should have been sealed, was open. So, too, was the fish hold.Everything began flowing in the wrong direction. Water bubbled up through floor drains and sprayed in through portholes, and walls became waterfalls. The ability of a boat to flush its decks is as essential as humans’ ability to breathe. Water always needs to be leaving the vessel faster than it is entering. When it’s not, problems multiply quickly. The crew had stacked flattened cardboard boxes over the generator in a futile effort to protect it from the water coming in from above. Soon, the drainage pumps shut off. Even before the Oyang 70 began taking on water, the ship was off-kilter because the captain had ordered most of the boxed fish to be stacked in one hold, rather than spread across two. The ship’s fuel tanks had not been filled to maximum, adding to the Oyang’s instability because of internal sloshing.At about 4am, a heated argument erupted on the bridge. The chief engineer was in tears and screaming in Korean at the captain, pleading with him to cut the net. The captain finally gave in. The bosun put on a harness and shimmied on to a section of the mesh, knife in hand. Other crewmen followed, all slashing frantically at the net. Too little, too late – the ship continued to roll over.What had been obvious before was now unavoidable: the Oyang 70 was going down. Chaos overtook the ship. On the bridge, Shin made a distress call on the VHF radio. Men began leaping into the sea. Only the Korean officers wore life jackets. The Oyang’s rescue boat was in the water. But it, too, had been overturned by the waves.The water temperature before dawn that morning was about 6C. The ship had 68 survival suits, designed to insulate against the cold – more than enough for the 51 men on board. None of the crew put one on. It is unclear if any of them knew how.Greed, not water, sank the Oyang 70. The ship had tried to swallow too much fish the ocean swallowed the ship instead. The last men off the drowning ship said that they saw Shin in the wheelhouse, refusing to abandon his post or put on a life jacket. Hugging a pole and clutching his clear bottle, he was muttering in Korean and crying. The Amaltal Atlantis, a New Zealand-flagged fishing boat, heard the VHF call and headed to the scene, arriving an hour later. Much later and the 45 men it rescued would likely have frozen or drowned.Several of the survivors suffered acute hypothermia. Rescuers never recovered the captain’s body. Among the five other crew members who died, three were found frozen, floating in a lifeboat. On land, a preventable disaster like this might have spelled the end of a company. Not so on the open ocean.In the world of deep-sea fishing, the Sajo Group is a leviathan. Founded in 1971, the group oversees a huge fleet of more than 70 fishing ships. The company’s slogan is “Nature is delicious”. By 2010, the group had made more than $1bn in annual revenue, millions of dollars of which came from fish pulled from New Zealand waters.The Sajo Oyang’s corporate presence in New Zealand was structured like Russian dolls: larger companies enveloping subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of subsidiaries. The men who worked on the boats were recruited and contracted not by the Sajo Oyang company directly, but by agencies based in Indonesia, Myanmar, South Korea and elsewhere. By outsourcing the recruitment, logistics and payroll of foreign crews, the company centralised profits and decentralised liability.The sinking of the Oyang 70 made headline news in New Zealand. To handle damage control, the company tapped a pugnacious lobbyist and spokesman named Glenn Inwood, who was famous for representing several other controversial industries, such as whaling and tobacco.About eight months after the Oyang 70 sank, its replacement, the Oyang 75, arrived at Lyttelton Port in New Zealand. Shortly before it departed again for the fishing grounds, Inwood gave reporters a tour of the new vessel, which he hailed as a model of the highest labour and fishing standards. But even Sajo Oyang’s deft fixer couldn’t control the publicity surrounding what happened next. Early on the cold morning of 20 June 2011, a parishioner went to her church in Lyttelton, where she discovered 32 Indonesian men hiding in the nave. Shivering and distraught, the Indonesian men had fled the “model” Oyang 75 while the ship was being unloaded.Waking up at about 4am, the Indonesians had snuck off the ship while the captain was still asleep. Because they were Muslim, the men had wandered the streets looking for a mosque finding none, they took refuge in the church instead.One by one, the men described to church officials and later to government investigators their captivity on a ship of horrors. A chief engineer broke a deckhand’s nose for inadvertently bumping into him. Another officer punched a crew member in the head so often that he lost part of his vision. Insubordinate crew were sometimes locked in the refrigerator. Others were forced to eat rotten fish bait. On good days, shifts lasted 20 hours. Sometimes they worked for 48 hours straight. “I often thought about asking for help,” Andi Sukendar, one of the Indonesian deckhands, said in court papers. “But I didn’t know who to ask.”The worst part, the men said, was the sexual assaults, mostly at the hands of a sadistic bosun who would steal their clothing as they bathed so that he could chase them as they ran naked back to their bunks. In the galley, he approached the men from behind and jabbed them with his exposed erection. When they passed him in the halls, he grabbed their genitals. Other Korean officers made advances, the crewmen said, but none were as aggressive as the bosun. He assaulted deckhands while they showered. He climbed into their bunks at night when they were sleeping.“The bosun tried to teach me how to have sex with him but I refused,” one crew member recounted. Others were not able to stave him off.I wish I could say I was surprised by these reports. But what I read was sickeningly familiar. The expanse of the sea and the dictatorial power of officers over crews allow abusive behaviour that is often only uncovered when a ship sinks.As police interviewed the Oyang 75’s crew in Lyttelton, the ship’s owner refused to pay for their accommodation or food, claiming that they no longer worked for him. The bosun was fired and quickly sent back to Korea, avoiding prosecution in New Zealand. The people in Indonesia who had recruited the men to the ships repeatedly called the crew members’ families, pressuring them to be quiet and not talk to reporters or lawyers.Over the next year, a New Zealand journalist, Michael Field, and two University of Auckland researchers, Christina Stringer and Glenn Simmons, investigated further. Interviewing dozens of crewmen from several Sajo Oyang company vessels and hundreds of men from other foreign ships fishing in New Zealand waters, they revealed a broad pattern of abuse.Beyond the abhorrent working conditions on its ships, the Oyang fleet was putting entire ecosystems at risk with its fishing practices. One ship was impounded in Russia for illegal fishing and later fined in New Zealand for discharging thousands of gallons of used engine oil into the sea. Two other Sajo Oyang ships had been caught in New Zealand’s waters dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of fish overboard, a practice known as high-grading, used to circumvent catch quotas and make room for fresher or more valuable fish.Meanwhile, workers on Sajo Oyang ships described meals speckled with dead bugs and mattresses riddled with biting mites, men hiding in closets from violent officers, and rapes that occurred in nearby bunks that they felt powerless to stop. Crewmen recounted being issued torn hand-me-downs and ill-fitting boots, tattered jackets and gloves. Captains kept the sailors’ passports and certification papers to ensure they could not leave.On one of the company’s other ships in New Zealand’s waters, a deckhand accidentally crushed his finger under a heavy roll of rope. When it was later amputated, he was sent immediately back to work below deck, causing his wound to reopen. He woke up at night to find cockroaches crawling on it, drawn by the dried blood. An engineer told investigators that the crew was only allowed to wash garments with seawater in bags used for fish processing, leaving him little choice but to wear rancid-smelling work clothes every day. Another man who worked in the ship’s storage area described food flecked with bugs he ate it anyway, because he was so hungry.The story of the Oyang fleet was also a story about entrapment. Why did men take these jobs? Once they saw how bad the conditions were, why didn’t they flee immediately?Most of the crew members on the Sajo Oyang ships were from Tegal in central Java, Indonesia, and had been recruited by through an intricate system of debt bondage. They had signed contracts in English, a language they did not speak. Typically, their salary was about US$235 per month – a fraction of the minimum wage required under law, at least while they worked in New Zealand’s waters.Breaching the contracts would bring economic ruin to their families. One deckhand on another vessel, the Oyang 77, put up his elementary and junior high school graduation certificates. In his small village, such records are irreplaceable. If he failed to get the papers back, he would be unemployable. The documents were “the only things of value he had”, one affidavit said.News of the scams and abuse in this work rarely made it back to the small villages where new crew members were recruited, because those who had been tricked were too ashamed to talk about it or to warn others. Even those who knew the risks were willing to try their luck, because they were desperate for work.As the conditions on these ships came to light in New Zealand, the public was horrified and lawmakers began cracking down. The fishing industry went on the offensive. Inwood, the industry’s all-purpose fixer, led the charge, arguing that working long hours was a standard practice on all fishing ships. The failure to pay wages was the fault not of the Sajo Oyang company but of manning agents in Indonesia who were responsible for handling such matters. Koreans tend to be more physical and vocal than Indonesians, he argued. Some of the abuse allegations on the ships were supposedly misunderstandings stemming from these cultural differences.“During its entire period of operating in New Zealand, Sajo Oyang, its officers, crew and representatives have never been the subject of a prosecution,” Inwood wrote in a letter to the editor of a New Zealand newspaper in July 2012. “That is a rare accomplishment in an industry as highly regulated as the New Zealand fishing industry.”Other fishing companies argued that the problems in the Sajo Oyang fleet were isolated and should not be used to justify new regulations. Meanwhile, the Sajo Oyang company worked to protect its brand.While reporting in Auckland in the spring of 2017, I met with Christina Stringer, one of the two University of Auckland researchers who had brought to light many of the abuses in New Zealand’s waters. She recounted how, at one point during her investigation into foreign fishing fleets, she and her research partner, Glenn Simmons, were dining at a local Chinese restaurant with several Indonesian crew members from one of the Oyang ships. The men were living in safe houses at the time and, having no income, were dependent on the kindness of strangers to eat. The former boss of the crew happened to be dining at the same restaurant, and after he took pictures of the crew with his cell phone and made some calls, a group of men appeared outside the restaurant, glaring at the crew as they waited for them to leave. Simmons hustled the crew to a car out the back and managed to lose the group, though not without a chase.The company had good reason to fight the bad publicity. The New Zealand government had begun issuing fines: NZ$420,000 for the Oyang 75’s dumping of low-value catches to replace them with more valuable fish, NZ$10,500 for illegally dumping oil at sea, and NZ$120,000 for when the Oyang 77 tossed more than 50 tonnes of fish overboard.Pressure was also mounting from abroad. The US State Department released its annual Trafficking in Persons Report in June 2012, which explicitly faulted New Zealand for poor treatment of foreign fishing workers. In response, New Zealand took a drastic step. In August 2014, the parliament passed a law expelling all foreign fishing vessels from its national waters. Fishing companies had two years to comply, and were given the option of “reflagging” to New Zealand and operating under its full legal jurisdiction.The law was meant to better protect the roughly 1,500 foreign nationals working on foreign-chartered vessels in its waters by forcing these ships to comply with New Zealand’s labour standards. It was a bold move, because it would cost New Zealand hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment as fishing companies moved elsewhere rather than shoulder the added burden and cost of the new regulations. To fish in New Zealand’s waters, all crew had to be provided with access to personalised bank accounts in which to deposit wages, observers would be required on virtually all foreign-owned fishing vessels, and there would be independent audits of wages.The existence of forced labour on fishing ships was not a revelation. Stories of sea slavery had been reported for more than a decade on boats from Thailand, Taiwan and elsewhere. But no country had ever acted as aggressively as New Zealand did in response.Still, seafarer unions and lawyers for the fishing boat workers questioned whether the government had gone far enough. They argued that the effect of New Zealand’s law would be to push bad behaviour elsewhere as the worst scofflaws simply opted to leave New Zealand’s waters and set up shop in jurisdictions that exert even less control over foreign fishing fleets. The Oyang 75 subsequently travelled to east Africa, near Mauritius, while the Oyang 77 sailed to an area near the Falkland Islands. The horrors that repeatedly befell the hapless crews of Sajo Oyang ships were infuriating and tragic. More importantly, though, they illustrated the chaotic, desultory nature of maritime regulation. Forcing companies to follow labour laws, to observe fishing regulations and to abide by national boundaries requires robust enforcement regimens, constant vigilance and a dogged dedication to a higher legal – if not moral – code. But usually, it requires something else, too, an ingredient that is often missing: participation and cooperation of the men on the receiving end of abuse.Before one of the investigators left the Oyang 75, one of the workers on board, a 28-year-old Indonesian man named Purwanto, pulled him aside. Purwanto seemed genuinely puzzled why anyone would take an interest in the conditions of his work, whether he was satisfied and paid. “No one has ever asked about us before,” said Purwanto, who had been working on the ship for a year. “Why do you want to know about life on the ship?” he asked. The investigator and the union inspector responded that they were simply checking for labour violations. Purwanto said that even if there were violations, it didn’t matter – he needed the job, so he would not say anything more. There was nothing else for him back in Indonesia, he said. “This is the best we can get.”This is an edited extract from The Outlaw Ocean: Crime and Survival in the Last Untamed Frontier by Ian Urbina, published by The Bodley Head on 19 September and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c61f4e99a4b242b05d2a2188e23fa2eea04848/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f1b81d772134fc3eba4d2d72bdd7a6","title":"juan guaido faces questions over links to organised groups","story":"Opposition leader plays down images but analysts say they could prove highly damagingJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan politician fighting to topple Nicolás Maduro, is facing awkward questions about his relationship with organised crime after the publication of compromising photographs showing him with two Colombian paramilitaries.In an interview on Friday, Guaidó played down the significance of the pictures, in which he posed alongside two members of the Colombian criminal gang the Rastrojos identified as El Brother and El Menor.The photos appear to have been taken on 22 February as Guaidó used an illegal border crossing to sneak across Venezuela’s western border into Colombia to attend a Live Aid-style concert in the town of Cúcuta.“I took hundreds of photos that day,” Guaidó told the Colombian broadcaster Blu Radio. “It was hard to know who was asking for a photo. Misconstruing these photos means playing the Maduro regime’s game.”On Friday Venezuela’s state prosecutor’s office said it would open an investigation into the photos. Analysts said the images had the potential to cause severe harm to Guaidó’s credibility and his nine-month quest to force Maduro from power.The Rastrojos are a drug-trafficking group with paramilitary origins who operate on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border. As well as the cocaine trade, they are engaged in illegal mining, kidnapping for ransom and extortion.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group, said: “I think it is extremely damaging. Regardless of whether this was as innocent as they claim – which is rather hard to believe – or whether there was something more to it, it looks so bad.”Gunson said the photos handed “a huge propaganda victory” to Maduro’s government, which is fending off accusations of ties to leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.Maduro sought to exploit the scandal on Thursday, claiming the images were definitive evidence of Guaidó’s ties to “paracos, murderers and narco-traffickers”.In a televised speech, Maduro declared: “The connection between Colombian narco-trafficking and the Venezuelan right is right there in the photo. No one can deny it.”Gunson said that whatever the truth, the photos showed “unbelievable naivety” and were an embarrassment to the international coalition backing Guaidó, which includes the US, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.“It could almost not have come at a worse time for Guaidó,” Gunson said, pointing to the Colombian government’s plans to denounce Maduro’s ties to leftist guerrillas at the UN general assembly later this month.The photos were published on Thursday by Wilfredo Cañizales, the director of a human rights group in Cúcuta, where February’s highly politicised concert was held.Speaking to the , Cañizales claimed the Rastrojos had imposed a curfew along the border before Guaidó’s crossing into Colombia “to make sure no locals would take photos of him crossing illegally through the hidden paths”.Cañizales declined to say how he had obtained the photos or why he had decided to publish them but said: “The Rastrojos are paramilitaries. They are the ones in this region who decide who lives and who dies.”Gunson said the photos also posed uncomfortable questions for Guaidó’s backers in the Colombian government and their possible links with paramilitary groups. “There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c84534d56d2e9bed9974674d7bb54e1c83f71a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b9a77395a452082df6ead360f242bf","title":"judge who convicted geoffrey boycott i stand by my verdict","story":"‘I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,’ says French judge The French judge who convicted Geoffrey Boycott of assaulting his girlfriend has criticised the former England cricketer after he was knighted and says she stands by her decision to find him guilty.The move to award Boycott the honour prompted outrage this week from a domestic violence charity. He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times.Boycott, who has always denied the offence, said he “couldn’t give a toss” about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice.But after being tracked down by the  in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott’s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been “arrogant” and “deplorable”.“I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,” she said. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. Now that I’m really shocked at. He doesn’t deserve it.“As far as French justice is concerned, he has been found guilty of having beaten his partner three times.”The retired judge said: “I remember this case very well and I remember the row about it even after 20 years. I saw all the photos, the evidence, the statements and if I didn’t think he was guilty I wouldn’t have convicted him.” Boycott was fined £5,300 and given a three-month suspended jail sentence, upheld by a second court on appeal. He was also ordered to pay a symbolic one franc in compensation to Moore.The 78-year-old former England captain, who has been commentating for Channel 5 and BBC Radio 5 Live during this summer’s Ashes series, has always denied the charges and claimed Moore was a “woman scorned” exacting her revenge.“Boycott was most definitely not a gentleman,” Haumant said. “He told one of the opposing lawyers to shut up during the hearing. That was extremely vulgar and not something you say during a hearing. I can’t imagine a judge in your country allowing that, and I wouldn’t allow it.”“He claimed it was an accident, but, as I say, if I convicted him it was because I thought he was guilty and I stand by that. He appealed and my judgment was upheld by the appeal court.“It is more than 20 years ago, but I still remember his behaviour in the courtroom. He was arrogant and he had a deplorable attitude throughout the trial.”After he was convicted in the court in Grasse, on the Côte d’Azur, Boycott took a swipe at the French judge, saying he was not entirely surprised to be found guilty “in view of the way the trial was conducted”. He claimed that unlike the UK, the legal system in France rested on the principle of “guilty until proven innocent”.He said he did not care about condemnation of his honour from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women’s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May’s resignation honours list as “extremely disappointing”, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: “I don’t give a toss about her, love.”The French legal system, like the British, is based on the principle that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. All but the most serious crimes and offences, those carrying a prison sentence of 10 years or more, are tried without a jury.People are not “charged” with a crime or offence in France, they are “put under investigation”. Before the case comes to trial, an investigating magistrate known as a juge d’instruction tells police to collect evidence and takes witness statements to produce a case file to determine whether an offence has been committed.If the magistrate decides there is no charge to answer, the case is classé, or dropped. If the magistrate decides there is a case to answer, the person is sent to trial and the file, available to the lawyers of all interested parties, is presented to the trial judge.There were three hearings in the Moore v Boycott case. He was first convicted of assault in January 1998 by judge Marc Juando at a court in Grasse. He was not present for the hearing and appealed successfully to have the verdict set aside. Haumant presided over a second trial in Grasse in November 1998 that confirmed the verdict of the first. Boycott appealed and a panel of three judges upheld the conviction in May 2000.The November 1998 trial was long and at times chaotic. Boycott was said to have flown 13 witnesses to the south of France at an estimated cost of more than £200,000, but many appeared to have nothing to say directly about the accusations. They included a psychiatrist who had never met Moore but gave his interpretation of her behaviour from television clips and conversations with her former husband.Haumant remembers sitting until the early hours of the morning hearing witnesses, many of them appearing for Boycott, all of whose testimony had to be translated. “It was a long trial, but then there were a lot of witnesses, most of them for the defendant,” she said.The verdict in January had been set aside because Boycott failed to turn up to the brief hearing, explaining he was on tour commentating on Test matches in South Africa.Boycott and Moore were staying at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes in October 1996 when they argued. Moore was reported to have become even more furious when she returned to their hotel room to find Boycott packing for an early flight back to the UK.He claimed she had slipped in the ensuing fracas while throwing his clothing and belongings out of the window.Moore said he had attacked her, holding her to the ground and staring at her with “wild, piercing and manic” eyes as he hit her.In her seven-page written explanation of her verdict, Haumant, who told British journalists covering the trial that her hero was the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, made it clear she was not impressed with Boycott’s behaviour in or out of court.“In the court, the accused didn’t hesitate to interrupt Mrs Moore’s lawyer rudely, tarnishing the image of the perfect gentleman which he brought his old friends and witnesses to testify to,” she wrote at the time. She said the evidence presented to the court “does not support the theory of an accidental fall” and ruled that Moore had been the victim of “purposeful blows”.Boycott accused Moore of blackmailing him to settle for a large sum of money, but she said it was never about cash. She asked for and was awarded the symbolic one franc damages. Boycott, labelled a woman-beater and criminal, found it difficult to shake off the stain on his reputation, even when Moore’s former solicitor Sue Sims-Steward said Moore saw Boycott as a way of solving financial problems and portrayed the victim as a difficult woman who could “turn on the tears at will”.“It’s no surprise to me that he’s been given an honour,” said Haumant. “I remember reading a profile of Theresa May in the French magazine l’Express when she said her great idol was not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but Geoffrey Boycott.“On the other hand it is surprising because of what he did,” she said.“I was heavily criticised for my judgment to the point I worried that I’d better not go to the UK because I wouldn’t be safe in the street. I remember an article that made fun of me for not knowing anything about cricket, but why would I?”A spokesman for Boycott did not comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fe4b365fa53b7c435cd14d882365c99c308cf8/0_211_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be2151eed25d0f92e227fb59f73d3a28","title":"science on safety of chlorinated chicken misunderstood","story":"Government’s assurances that there are no health problems are misleading, say food policy expertsThe government has misunderstood the science on the safety of chlorinated chicken, a group of senior food policy experts has said.It has also failed to give watertight commitments that it would not be sold here after a no-deal Brexit, they warn.The experts have written to all MPs to warn that the British public is being “softened up” to accept chlorinated chicken and other food produced under US safety standards, despite it posing a danger to health.In a briefing from the Centre for Food Policy, timed to reach MPs before party conferences, they argue that recent assurances by a government chief scientist were misleading, and a no-deal Brexit could open the door to unsafe food.Prof Sir Ian Boyd, the outgoing chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said in an interview two weeks ago there were “no health problems” with chlorinated chicken and its consumption should be a matter of “consumer choice” rather than government policy.But the academics point to research published last year which found washing food in bleach does not kill many of the pathogens that cause food poisoning. Instead, it sends them into a “viable but non-culturable state”, which means they are not picked up in standard tests, which take a sample of the food and try to culture any germs on it.The presence of the pathogens is thus masked by the bleach, but they are still dangerous to human health.He said a no-deal Brexit would increase the pressure for the UK to accept food from abroad produced to US standards, especially if shortages raised prices, and warned that current laws on labelling were inadequate.Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City Universityand also a co-author, said the government was “wriggling” over the definitions of safety. “For the chief scientist at Defra to say what he did is not accidental,” he said.Robert Wood Johnson, the US ambassador, responded to the : “Sir Ian Boyd is absolutely right: American food safety standards are second to none. The EU’s scientists have said antimicrobial washes are the most effective and economical way to deal with potentially lethal bacteria like salmonella and campylobacter. The World Health Organisation found North America has the lowest incidence of foodborne illness anywhere in the world. A comprehensive free-trade agreement that includes agriculture will create more opportunity, greater choices and wider prosperity for both British and American farmers and consumers.”His clear signal that agriculture should be part of a trade deal faces ministers with difficult choices. Farmers fear being undercut by lower-standard imports, while supermarkets are concerned that they will be blamed over any future food safety scares.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, told the : “Even if we leave the EU with a deal, there is a very real risk that we will have to compete with food imports that have been produced using methods and products that would be illegal on British farms. We need a clear commitment from government that it will set up a trade and standards commission to provide certainty for both farmers and the British public that our values of food production will be respected post-Brexit.”A spokesperson for Defra stopped short of an explicit commitment on chlorinated chicken, or that EU standards would be maintained: “We have been clear that any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies. Without exception, imports will meet our stringent food safety standards. After EU exit, the UK will decide how we set and maintain our own standards and regulations.”Gareth Morgan, head of farming and land use policy at the Soil Association, warned that consumers would face issues beyond food safety: “The notion that chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef are “safe” misses the point. These practices prop up inherently unsafe industrial farming systems with terrible welfare standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88af6382fecd2c62dc17c54d37c5a42f185ca207/0_184_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94312dd29d7a85ff21c2bc1f9078402b","title":"tunisia berlusconi wild card nation goes to polls nabil karoui","story":"Jailed Nabil Karoui hopes to appeal to voters disillusioned by lack of progress since Arab springCampaigning ends on Friday in Tunisia’s presidential election before Sunday’s first round of voting, pitting more than two dozen candidates against each other, including a media mogul running for office from jail.Tunisia is the last of the Arab spring countries still on a democratic track, after Egypt slipped back toward authoritarianism and Syria and Libya descended into conflict.The jailed Nabil Karoui, one of the leading candidates, started a hunger strike this week. He is owner of the unlicensed Nessma TV channel, which he has used to promote his political ambitions. He was detained in August on suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering, charges that his supporters say are politically motivated.His detention is a wild card in the long-running struggle for political supremacy in the young democracy, which has pitted the moderate Islamist Ennahda party against the increasingly splintered anti-Islamist opposition.Karoui’s appeal has been pitched against a sense of growing disillusionment with the country’s main political leaders, who have failed to improve the lives of ordinary citizens since the country launched the Arab spring in 2011 by toppling of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.Karoui is sometimes depicted as Tunisia’s equivalent of Silvio Berlusconi. In reality, however, he is more like the wealthy paterfamilias in a Middle Eastern soap opera, a man touched by both tragedy and success – an image he has skilfully communicated to a key impoverished section of Tunisian society that has until now been detached from the main political trends.He has used his TV channel to air images of himself delivering aid from a family charity to the poor, a slick and sometimes populist figure in comparison with his rivals.The wealthy secular political elite, which he once backed, now see him as a threat, while some on the Islamist side have still not forgiven him for screening Marjane Satrapi’s Franco-Iranian film Persepolis in 2011.Chief among Karoui’s rivals is Youssef Chahed, the current prime minister. Karoui’s supporters blame him for putting their man behind bars in an effort to hobble his campaign.In his campaign offices in Tunis, Karoui’s team believe the moves against him may have benefited their candidate, not least the constant attacks on him on social media which have kept his name in the public eye.“Before his arrest all the indications were that he was 10 points ahead, so we are confident,” said a spokesman, Abdelaziz Belkhodja, adding that they had managed the campaign without the presence of their candidate and with all of his accounts frozen.“He started his hunger strike for several reasons, above all because he wants the right to vote and his civil rights recognised.”The presidential vote was due to take place later in the autumn following parliamentary elections, but was abruptly brought forward after the death of the incumbent, Béji Caïd Essebsi, in August.Observers suggest the campaign is so close between the frontrunners that a fraction of a percentage point could decide who goes through to the runoff.Although the role of president is supposed to be less important than the parliament and prime minister, Essebsi tried to accrue more power and status, presenting himself as a modern incarnation of the country’s founding father, Habib Bourguiba, down to wearing the same style of glasses.Tunisia’s economy, not least its key tourism sector, has struggled since terrorist attacks in 2015 on two tourist sites, the resort of Sousse and the Bardo museum, in which 60 people were killed.Tunisia’s electoral body has declared that Karoui is entitled to run, but it is unclear is what would happen if he won the runoff for president, which would pose constitutional questions if he was still in jail.Commenting on the importance of the current round of elections, Djordje Todorovic, a spokesperson for a joint election observation mission by the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said that this time round Tunisians were more focused on day-to-day issues.“The elections in 2011 were to punish the old regime and celebrate freedom. In 2015 it was an issue of identity – who was Islamist and who was not. Now the question voters are asking of politicians is: ‘What are you going to do for me?’ with the economy a priority.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017102.1568377088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar says gap between eu and uk on deal very wide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar pictured at the Fine Gael pre-Dáil parliamentary party think-in at Garryvoe in east Cork on Friday. Photograph:  ProvisionThe gap between Britain and the European Union over Brexit remains “very wide,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday.His comments come as British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to make a renewed push to reach an exit deal with the European Union. Mr Johnson will hold his first meeting with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday but signs of a breakthrough remained distant with the DUP pouring cold water on suggestions the contentious Irish border “backstop” could be reworked.An article in Friday’s Times newspaper said the DUP had agreed to shift its red lines on Brexit, saying it could accept Northern Ireland abiding by some EU rules post-Brexit as part of a new deal to replace the Irish backstop. The paper claimed the DUP had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, something it had previously said was unacceptable since it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the rest of the UK.Democratic Unionist Party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson rejected the report as nonsense. “We will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop... It won’t be a backstop by any other name either. We will not be accepting separate arrangements that cut us off from UK”. He suggested the Northern Ireland assembly would require an effective veto of any EU regulations, only approving measures “if we believe it is to the advantage of industry in Northern Ireland,” something the EU and Ireland have repeatedly rejected. DUP leader Arlene Foster also rejected the suggestion in a tweet, saying the “UK must leave as one nation”.“We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK,” Foster said. With Mr Johnson vowing to take Britain out of the EU on October 31st with or without a deal, the EU has focused in recent days on whether the main disagreement - over plans to guarantee the border in Ireland remains open - can be bridged. A deal reached last year with Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May would guarantee regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland to help keep goods flowing. But the British parliament rejected this three times. Mr Johnson says the border backstop must be replaced to reach any Withdrawal deal. The EU says any replacement must have the same effect as the backstop, and so far London has offered no proposals that are considered sufficient. “The gap is very wide,” he said. Mr Johnson’s office said he would hold talks with Mr Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday as he continued his efforts to reach an agreement to smooth Britain’s EU departure. Incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan on Friday said he saw “some cause for optimism” about a breakthrough in negotiations, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.But Northern Ireland’s largest political party, whose 10 members of parliament support Johnson’s minority government, suggested a deal was not close, saying it would not let the British region be forced to accept EU regulations after Brexit.Mr Johnson’s government lost its working majority in parliament last week after expulsions and defections from his Conservatives, which means the DUP no longer holds the balance of power in parliament. But its votes could still prove crucial as Johnson tries to convince Brussels that he can secure parliamentary approval for any deal. Also on Friday, incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said the EU would probably grant an extension to the UK, should one be requested. “I think that if they ask it in the context of an election, then the 27 other members will grant that extension, but of course we have a bit to go yet because there is a possibility yet that Mr Johnson may wish to engage with the European Union and come forward with proposals to break this impasse.” Mr Hogan also said “deadlines usually concentrate the mind and on all previous occasions there was always movement close to deadlines” and said he expected this to happen again. - Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen  AFPSenior figures within the DUP are willing to accept some form of cross-Border co-operation to avoid the backstop and allow a deal to be reached over the UK’s exit from the EU.DUP MP for Strangford Jim Shannon told The  the party was looking at “practical and helpful methods” consistent with the agri-food arrangements which already existed on an all-Ireland basis.He also said the idea of an all-Ireland food zone was being discussed by the Conservative party’s pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). He had been told, he said, that this would “still mean the removal of the backstop. It will mean it will become a co-operation,” he said.“If the co-operation is co-operation which doesn’t impact constitutionally or politically upon our position within the United Kingdom then it could, and may well be, a method of going forward,” Mr Shannon said.He emphasised that there would be no border in the Irish Sea, and said that there had been no change in the DUP’s opposition to the backstop. “There’s no deviation. The backstop has to be removed, and both the British government and ourselves are on the same page.”But, he said, “that doesn’t mean there’s not discussions taking place about trying to find a way forward, because there should be”.He is the latest among a number of senior party members to express their willingness to consider alternative economic “arrangements” to the backstop, which is aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told BBC Newsnight on Monday the party was willing to consider arrangements that were of benefit to Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and subject to the consent of the North’s Assembly.‘Sensible deal’There are doubts about the feasibility of such a plan, not least because of the continued lack of the Stormont Assembly, which collapsed two and a half years ago and has yet to be restored. That aside, it is unlikely the EU would agree to cede control to a regional parliament, particularly one which – if it were to be restored – has a mechanism which would give an effective veto to either the DUP or Sinn Féin.However, as the October 31st deadline for the UK crashing out of the EU approaches, there has been more talk of compromise.DUP leader Arlene Foster has called for a “sensible deal”, while the former first minister Peter Robinson told The  “every effort should be made to have an orderly Brexit for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said “where it was appropriate and EU legislation was necessary to keep the free flow of trade across the Irish Border, especially in the agri-food industry, and where it didn’t damage our relationships with our biggest market in GB, then of course, that’s the kind of thing that the Northern Ireland Assembly should be open to consider”. This, he said, was “different from giving carte blanche to the EU”.Lord Hay, former assembly speaker, also gave his support to the proposal. “Before, if you looked at the backstop, everything was being controlled by Brussels and Dublin,” he said. “I think this could be the lock that the assembly has and holds.”He said British prime minister Boris Johnson was “genuine” in trying to find a deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit. “We accept his word on that... at this minute in time, I think we’ve got to trust the prime minister.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images.DUP leader Arlene Foster has dismissed a report her party will offer UK prime minister Boris Johnson a lifeline to help him unlock a Brexit deal.A front page article in today’s Times newspaper said the DUP has agreed to shift its red lines on Brexit, saying it could accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules post-Brexit as part of a new deal to replace the Irish backstop.The paper claimed the DUP, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, something it had previously said was unacceptable since it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland.The Times, citing unidentified sources, wrote that in return for such concessions Brussels would abandon its insistence on Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU.However, Mrs Foster insists that, as previously indicated, any moves which did make Northern Ireland different to the rest of the UK would be unacceptable to the party.“UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK,” Mrs Foster tweeted.“We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.”She added: “Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.”Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has been warned against breaking the law over Brexit by Speaker John Bercow, who vowed “creativity” in Parliament would scupper a no-deal exit.The warning came as the EU’s chief negotiator said there is “no reason to be optimistic” that a new agreement can be brokered before the prime minister’s deadline to ask for a delay.Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European Parliament on Thursday that he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK Government would result in a deal by mid-October.The PM is legally bound to ask Brussels for an extension to Article 50 if he cannot get MPs to back a deal by October 19th, after Parliament approved legislation designed to prevent a no deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017186.1568382933!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk may soon have new prime minister who could decide not to exit eu phil hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Phil Hogan raised   possibility that the UK may not ultimately exit the EU given that the upcoming election could lead to a new government with a different mandate from the British people.  Photograph Nick BradshawThe The United Kingdom may have a new prime minister in several weeks who may decide not to exit the European Union, newly nominated EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has said.Speaking to an audience at the RDS in Dublin, Mr Hogan said that the actions of some members of the Conservative Party to block a no-deal departure had improved the likelihood of a further extension to the Brexit deadline beyond October 31st and a general election in November.This has concentrated the mind of the British prime minister Boris Johnson and left him in a “vulnerable position” without a parliamentary majority, he said.He believed Mr Johnson would make “every possible effort to do a deal” between now and the resumption of the UK parliament on October 14th. He thought that the prime minister wanted a deal “but not everyone around him wants a deal,” said Mr Hogan in a thinly veiled reference to the prime minister’s aide Dominic Cummings. In response to a question about Remainers not voting for the proposed Brexit deal, Mr Hogan raised the possibility that the UK may not ultimately exit the EU given that the upcoming election could lead to a new government with a different mandate from the British people.“You are presupposing that the United Kingdom are going out of the European Union. They may not. Mr Johnson has a big responsibility in the next four weeks. It could fall to somebody else on the fifth week and you could have a second referendum and this will be dependent on the mandate that whatever new government the UK will get in November,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Eamonn FarrellRollingNews.ieIt was claimed by senior Fine Gael figures that such statements could help “rehabilitate” the Opposition party.The Taoiseach made his comments about future co-operation with Fianna Fáil at the conclusion of the two-day Fine Gael parliamentary party think-in in Garryvoe, Co Cork.When asked if he would consider a so-called “grand coalition” after the election, Mr Varadkar said: “I would. Essentially any general election is going to depend on the result. Any general election is going to depend on the results.“My intention and expectation is that we win the election as the largest party again.We form a government and we head a coalition. But I am certainly not ruling out any future arrangement with Fianna Fáil. Either confidence and supply or coalition.”Fine Gael first offered a grand coalition to Fianna Fáil during the lengthy process of government formation after the 2016 general election. Enda Kenny’s offer was declined by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin at the time.Next electionHowever, Mr Varadkar said he would not underpin a Fianna Fáil-led minority government unless Mr Martin wins more seats than him at the next election. It means he would not facilitate Mr Martin’s election as taoiseach if Fianna Fáil, the Greens, Labour and others formed a coalition in a situation where Fine Gael was the largest party in the Dáil.“We certainly would not entertain a situation whereby we were the largest party in the Dáil and we were then somehow asked to facilitate the second and fourth and fifth party forming a government,” Mr Varadkar said.“Let there be no doubt about this. It is my intention and my plan and my expectation that Fine Gael will win the next election when it comes in May 2020.“We will be the largest party and as the largest party we will do what the largest party always does, which is seek to form a government. Ideally a coalition government with a majority.“While confidence and supply has worked reasonably well for just over three years now, a majority government would be better for the country and that’s what I want us to be in a position to do.”Reckless vs rehabilitationSome TDs and Ministers privately said they disagreed with the Taoiseach making the comments, claiming Fine Gael had spent its think-in describing Fianna Fáil as “reckless” only for Mr Varadkar to raise the prospect of bringing them back into government.“We shouldn’t be doing anything to rehabilitate them,” said one Minister, adding that if Fianna Fáil won the next election then questions would be asked about Mr Varadkar’s own position as leader.“If we don’t win the next election, who is to say it’ll be Leo Varadkar’s call?”One TD said that while Fine Gael first offered a grand coalition in 2016, it “wasn’t an indefinite offer”.The Taoiseach stressed he wanted to lead Fine Gael even if the party lost the next election.“Our party rules are there for anyone to see. If after an election we are not forming a government then there is a ballot of Oireachtas members as to whether they want me to continue or not. But I will want to continue in that circumstance.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017431.1568394438!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second brexit referendum cannot be ruled out says david cameron","story":"Former UK prime minister David Cameron has said a second Brexit referendum cannot be ruled out.In an interview with The Times, he admitted he thinks about the consequences of the 2016 poll “every single day” and worries “desperately” about what will happen next.Mr Cameron told the paper: “I think about this every day.

What are they doing there?”Lily Allen performs on stage at Mighty HooplaThe BBC said that Allen’s alleged attacker continues to work with Warner. Allen parted company with the label this summer.“We’re very focused on enforcing our Code of Conduct and providing a safe and professional environment at all times.”The alleged assault took place in the Caribbean, where Allen was working on new material.She recalled: “I had been at a party. He was in a position of responsibility. He’d got me out of this party and decided he wanted to take me back to my hotel. We got to my hotel. I couldn’t find my room keys, so he was like, ‘Well, why don’t you sleep in my bed while I go and get the keys?’”Allen said she had been drinking heavily and passed out. “The next thing I knew, I woke up and he was in my bed naked.”She said the man tried to have sex with her, and she jumped out of bed screaming.At the time, she did not report it to the label. “I’d made a decision that I didn’t want to go to the police, that I didn’t want to make a fuss and I wanted to keep it quiet. But I did want to protect myself,” she said.Allen said she felt her career had been damaged “as a result of talking about this stuff”.“People are always questioning what the victim’s intentions are, what it is that their end game is. I think the victims just want validation - they want someone to go, ‘Yeah, that happened, that was wrong, you’re a person, somebody crossed the line with you,’” she said.“And I’m a 34-year-old woman with two children, God knows what it’s like to be 19, 20, 21 in this industry.”Cara Delevingne: Harvey Weinstein told me to get a \u0026#39beard\u0026#39 to make it in HollywoodDavid Cameron reveals he got \u0026#39off his head\u0026#39 on cannabis during Eton schooldaysWorld\u0026#39s most powerful greenhouse gas on the rise \u0026#39due to green energy boom\u0026#39Actress Felicity Huffman sentenced to 14 days in prison for paying official to cheat on daughter\u0026#39s university examZimbabwe to build mausoleum for Robert Mugabe as family and government end burial feudHow murder detectives are using aeroplane scanners to solve more than 100 murdersLabour \u0026#39ripping apart\u0026#39 education, private school leaders warn as John McDonnell says they will be treated \u0026#39like any other business\u0026#39Comment: Convention underpins our democracy, and MPs toss it aside at their own riskBoris Johnson to meet Jean-Claude Juncker as DUP sources signal softening Brexit positionComment: Age could be a vote winner for Joe BidenCattle farmers campaign to lower age cows can be killed and sold as beefArmy combat vehicles could be electric in three years\u0026#39Difficult to see\u0026#39 if Iran breached Syria oil sale agreement, Gibraltar chief minister saysMuseums urged to display the harsh realities of Neanderthal livesUS officials warn of danger of feral hogs heading across the border from CanadaAsda leads supermarkets in cutting price of petrol by 3pComment: Leave.EU is vindicated and 17.4m of us have beaten the EstablishmentManchester Arena bombing intelligence to stay secretWorld\u0026#39s oldest new parents \u0026#39in intensive care\u0026#39 after birth of twin girls in IndiaRingo Starr and Paul McCartney reunite to record John Lennon song discovered on lost demo tapeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/09/bitcoin-billionaire-whale-.jpg","title":"bitcoin mystery trade cryptocurrency market transaction blockchain","story":"Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsCryptocurrency transfer is the most valuable ever recorded on the blockchainThe world\u0027s largest ever bitcoin transaction has taken place, with just over $1 billion (£802 million) worth of cryptocurrency transferred between accounts.The single transaction of 94,504 bitcoins represents around 0.5 per cent of all bitcoins currently in existence, and it\u0026nbsphas left analysts confused by who made it and for what purpose.The semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin means it is possible to view the transfer on its blockchain – the public ledger that records transactions – but it is not possible to know who made it.Such a large amount of bitcoin has the potential to crash the cryptocurrency market if it is cashed in for fiat currency.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red. These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation.

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThough the exoplanet was first spotted in 2015, new research has finally allowed scientists to reveal the existence of water.\u0026nbspCurrent equipment is only able to determine basic factors such as distance, mass and temperature but sophisticated tools developed at University College London helped\u0026nbsptranslate existing data from the Hubble Space Telescope to make sense of the unique molecule signatures of water vapour.K2-18b is classed as a super-Earth because it is bigger than our Earth – twice as big, as well as eight times heavier.K2-18b super-Earth (M\u0026nbspKornmesserESAHubbleAFP)K2-18b\u0026nbspis too far away for astronomers to see, but they can look at how starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere as it passes around its own sun, called\u0026nbspK2-18.The planet is a lot closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, meaning it only takes around 33 days to transit.“It’s the only planet outside our solar system that we know has the correct temperature, an atmosphere and water,” said lead\u0026nbspauthor Dr\u0026nbspAngelos\u0026nbspTsiaras.“Of course,\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis not a second Earth, because it is a planet that is much bigger, has a different atmospheric composition. It’s orbiting a completely different star, so it doesn’t look like Earth.“The search for habitable planets, it’s very exciting, but it’s here to always remind us that this\u0026nbspis our only home and it’s probably out of the question if we will be able to travel to other planets.”Although the planet sits in the habitable zone, scientists say that instruments available at present are not able to determine any signs of life.Exoplanets will get real names rather than numbersMany more observations are needed\u0026nbspto be sure that it is\u0026nbsphabitable.Scientists, who have published their findings in the Nature Astronomy journal after more than a year of work, believe that the water content could be as low as 0.01 per cent\u0026nbspor as high as 50 per cent.“We don’t know how much water there is however, what these models clearly say is that there is an atmosphere and that there is water there,” said co-author Dr\u0026nbspIngo\u0026nbspWaldmann.Researchers do not think\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis the only potentially habitable\u0026nbspsuper-Earth\u0026nbspand expect to find others with similar characteristics among more than 4,000 exoplanets that have already been discovered.They hope that newer technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope due to launch in March 2021, will unlock more secrets beyond our solar system.“We are looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and going even further,” Dr\u0026nbspTsiaras\u0026nbspadded.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the relationship between the men remains a mystery.The way in which the pair were buried represents “a voluntary expression of commitment between two iniduals” and was not a common burial practice, according to the research, which was published in the Scientific Reports journal.Created with Sketch.

So it’s not as straightforward as some people are suggesting,” Mr Coveney said.He added that the lack of worked out policy suggestions from the UK was a “a source of real frustration” on his side of the table.EU officials say the British government has still not presented “concrete proposals” for a replacement to the Irish backstop in the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

The actual figure could be higher when Labour releases official totals next week.\u0026nbspMost of the motions submitted are based on a template saying Labour should “campaign energetically for a public vote and to Remain” and “support revoking Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal”. They say the party should also “defend free movement and extend migrants’ rights”.It raises the prospect of a fresh battle between activists and the party leadership when the motion\u0026nbspis debated by delegates at the gathering. The text is likely to be amended during lengthy discussions to hammer out a compromise, with Mr Corbyn’s team and some trade unions expected to try to tone down some of the more anti-Brexit language.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “In an election, Labour needs the space to articulate a radical set of policies that will transform the economy and people’s lives. In government, it needs to be able to deliver on its promises. To have either of these things, we need to defeat Brexit and move the conversation on.“The public wants this to be over – any sense that we are going to engage in a lengthy renegotiation will be deeply unpopular. In government, Brexit would be an albatross around our necks – a pointless loss of time and energy, probably a loss of rights and protections and a fracturing of our support base.”Labour MP Clive Lewis, a supporter of the campaign, said: “As an MP, I know what wins elections for Labour – it’s our members, who are more than 90 per cent in favour of Remain.“Our army of volunteers aren’t just foot soldiers, they’re members of a democratic movement. They need to feel ownership over our Brexit policy, they need to be excited and enthused by it. Yes, the people should have the final say, but for our morale we need a clear anti-Brexit position in Labour. That means we must campaign in any public vote for Remain.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within the country’s overlooked hinterland, conditions are desperate, with unemployment in some areas thought to be as high as 30 per cent.Despite a much vaunted war on corruption, spearheaded by presidential candidate and current prime minister Youssef Chahed, the perception across much of the country is one of an entrenched elite getting richer, while many are left to languish in poverty.Created with Sketch.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence. Across the country, the same anger that sparked the country’s 2011 revolution continues to fester and continues to fuel Nabil Karoui’s populist campaign.Karoui\u0026nbsphas remained in detention since his arrest on 23 August, and he lost the second of two appeals for conditional release on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But he fell out of favour with Mr Erdogan in recent years, and has been sharply critical of his rule in recent months, prompting the party’s disciplinary board to consider his expulsion.In a televised appearance, the 60-year-old scholar and diplomat said he was quitting the AKP rather than forcing the trauma of a schismatic confrontation. \u0026nbspFor several years, Mr Davutoglu’s criticisms had been muted and mostly tolerated by Mr Erdogan. But an allegation he made last month suggesting government complicity in a series of 2015 terrorist attacks apparently crossed the line. The violent attacks scuttled peace talks between the Turkish state and rebellious Kurds, and appeared to bolster Mr Erdogan’s popularity ahead of general elections.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

Another founder of the AKP, former president Abdullah Gul, has been rumoured to be behind the effort but has yet to formally announce any involvement.\u0026nbspMr Davutoglu was widely seen as more moderate than Mr Erdogan, and has voiced sympathy for opposition activists and journalists caught up in the government’s years-long dragnet. But he was also the architect of the country’s Syria policy, and is blamed by both Erdogan supporters and opponents for opening Turkey’s borders to allow millions of Syrian refugees to settle in the country.\u0026nbspDavutoglu\u0026nbspannounced his resignation in a televised appearance (Haber Turk)Analysts say Mr Babacan’s prospects are better. Many Turks see him as the man behind the country’s decade-long economic boom, and see his departure from the cabinet in 2015 as the beginning of Turkey’s fiscal troubles. In an interview with the daily paper Karar this week, Mr Babacan insisted his new party would stand up for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law.\u0026nbsp“This is what Turkey strongly needs right now,” he was quoted as saying. “Freedom of thought and freedom of faith. The state itself should be the guarantor of this.”Unless there is pressure for early elections, Mr Erdogan will remain firmly in charge as president until 2023. He\u0026nbsphas dismissed the defections, predicting Mr Babacan “will go nowhere” by forming a new party, and accusing him of iding the Muslim community.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Secular, nationalist, and leftist opposition parties broke open Turkey’s constricted political space this year with victories against Mr Erdogan’s allies in mayoral elections, and some have accused the AKP dissidents of opportunistically entering the fray while doing little to resist the party’s abuses when they were in government.\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdogan shows snippets from New Zealand terrorist videos at campaign rallies“We didn’t really know about any of the disputes they had until they left,” said Onur Yerim, president of Dragoman Strategies, an Istanbul risk consultancy. “Nothing has surfaced over the years that there were major disagreements over policy. If there was, why didn’t they do anything about it when they were part of parliament or the cabinet and had seats and roles?”But analysts say the defections\u0026nbspcould nonetheless hurt Mr Erdogan, and help the opposition, potentially ending the political dominance of the AKP which began in 2002.\u0026nbsp“We are not sure whether it will lead to a big split among party members, but Davutoglu is claiming that the AK Party has lost its soul, its founding principles,” said Ilhan Uzgel, a political scientist based in Ankara. “He may not garner a lot of votes, but it may harm the image of the party, which is going in the direction of authoritarianism and corruption.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He annoyed people because he was clever, pompous and headstrong.”That description could be given today by many MPs, who have tired of Bercow’s constant attention-seeking and his delight in the sound of his own hammy voice.Just as aggravating has been his bias towards the anti-Conservative opposition. That was reflected yesterday in the Commons at news of his imminent resignation.In a nauseating display, Labour MPs who queued up to heap praise on him before they gave him a standing ovation.The Speaker should be a neutral referee who allows the game to flow freely and fairly.But, throughout his  years in charge of the chamber, Bercow was a whistle-happy, partisan official who acted as an additional player for his favoured side and continually put himself at the centre of the action.To understand Bercow, one incident is particularly illuminating. An early turning point in Bercow’s young le came when the head of his primary school refused to put him forward to grammar school, despite Bercow being so precocious he already read The Times .Instead he had to go to the local comprehensive, where he was bullied.On one occasion he was thrown in a pond as his chief tormentor said triumphantly, “Bercow is in there with the other amphibians.”But the experience fed Bercow’s determination to achieve, which he channelled into politics.To his army of left-wing supporters, he was a great reformer who modernised the practices of the Commons, expanded the role of backbenchers and held the Government rigorously to account.But to his enemies, he was squawking egomaniac who demeaned his office with his behaviour. His explicit cheerleading for left-wing causes and Remain was bad enough.This is a figure who subverted the rules of Parliament to wreck Brexit and undermine the Tory Government through endless procedural manoeuvres, as he has shown again this month.The notorious “B******s to Brexit” sticker on his family car, parked at Parliament, has reflected his attitude.His enthusiasm for the fashionable cause of ersity was highlighted in March  when, at a Westminster ceremony, he bizarrely described Elizabeth II as “a kaleidoscope Queen in a kaleidoscope country in a kaleidoscope Commonwealth.”In another typical move, he barred President Trump from addressing Parliament during his recent state visit, justying his stance on the grounds of Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism.”Nor has he been helped by his eccentric conduct of his we Sally, who is almost as big an attention-seeker as he is.She worked in public relations and was a Labour campaigner when they married in , but it was his elevation to the Speaker’s chair in  that really gave her the opportunity to bask in the limelight.Having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother – and been the first contestant in her series to be evicted – she went on to take part in an reality show with Paddy Doherty, the CBB winner, bare-knuckle fighter and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star, with the pair taking it in turns to experience the other’s lestyle.She caused more embarrassment with other incidents, like the infamous stunt in  when she was photographed in the shadow of Big Ben wearing just a strategically placed sheet.After that, Bercow reportedly “read her the riot act.”Yet she caused him further humiliation when it was revealed in March  that she had indulged in a long, passionate affair with the Speaker’s cousin, Alan Bercow.Though she rebuilt her marriage, she admitted that she was “a terrible we and always had been.”Perhaps the darkest episode of all was when used social media to hint that the former Tory Treasurer Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, a baseless smear for which she ended up in court in , was convicted of libel and ordered to pay undisclosed damages. Despite his legal victory, Lord McAlpine died soon afterwards.Before his marriage to Sally, Bercow had few serious relationships.Conceited and awkward with women, he was described in his youth by one female contemporary as a “loudmouthed” and “not attractive young man.”A female journalist who went on a few dates with him recalled that he “was a very odd little man and socially quite gauche. He was restless and found it hard to relax.”His insecurities were fed by his stature and also his unusual background, which gave him the sense of being an outsider.Further friction is generated by Bercow’s manner, which combines self-importance with linguistic showing-off and flashes of rudeness.Part of this stems from small man syndrome.Standing just  feet six inches tall, Bercow tries to make up for his lack of stature by parading his authority.The former Tory Minister Sir Simon Burns memorably described Bercow as “a sanctimonious dwarf.”Several Tories were so exasperated with him that in  that they tried to throw him out of his job.The MP James Durridge, who organised this unsuccessful bid, said that Labour find Bercow “convenient because he is a more effective opposition than their own leader.”But since then Bercow’s pro-Remain antics have stretched Conservative tolerance beyond breaking point.That’s why the party decided to take the unprecedented step of standing a candidate against Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next election in defiance of the long-standing tradition that the Speaker is never opposed by any of the main parties.There have been repeated accusations that Bercow has bullied his staff, allegations he denies, just as he disputes the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman.”Whatever the truth, he has not established a harmonious atmosphere at Westminster or enhanced his reputation.Unlike some of his predecessors like Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd, he leaves office under a cloud.Bercow was brilliant at tennis, even becoming a junior British champion. As a young player, he was described by a professional as “unbelievably talented and invincible.”To this day Bercow retains his deep enthusiasm for the sport and is a big fan of Roger Federer - particularlyhe can watch him for free.An investigation last year found he had received more than £, in freebies since he became speaker - most of which were tickets to tennis and football matches.Indeed, he was spotted at Wimbledon this year wearing a t-shirt with the Federer logo on it, while he was also caught by a BBC camera saying, “We all love you, Roger, all of us.”Im not sure the same can be said of Bercow.After a decade in the role of Speaker, he leaves behind a tainted legacy.He sees himself as a champion of Parliamentary democracy. But in reality, he has presided over a woefully discredited Commons.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too. Ditto former deputy PMDavid Lidington and big-bucks Tory donors Ehud Sheleg and David Brownlow.One of the few creditable things about Mrs May used to be that she resisted dishing out honours to her mates. Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop. The May team pursued a “Brexit in name only” and could not even achieve that.Honouring them is like giving an open-topped bus ride through the streets to a football team that has just been relegated. What will voters make of this gongs-for-the-boys culture A harmless bit of fun  Or a remote parliamentary crowd giving twirly titles to a long line of sub-par operatives The worst thing is that few of us are surprised by this stuff. I don’t suppose many of us genuinely believe politicians’ promises any more.How can we, when they said they would “honour the referendum” but now tell Boris Johnson to go to Brussels with a surrender letter This same elite, which so casually bungs honours to its pals, always sneers at the word “populist” as being something almost dirty.Instead, it wants the status quo. But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us.

And it won’t officially say which it would back.They’re fooling absolutely no one.And what “Leave option” would this be, anyway  Some fantasy Labour deal, even softer than Theresa May’s That would be blatantly unfair to Leavers, since many want No Deal.But then Remainers are no longer even pretending their second vote will be fair.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The whining. The complaining from both sidesabout a lack of democracy.The snarled fury. The endless bloody ponticating.It’s been more than three years and still nobody knows what the hell Labour’s policy is.Get a deal from Brussels and then vote against it, so far as I can discern.God only knows what sort of drugs old man Steptoe and his magic band of brothers are on.But then I’m not too sure what BoJo is up to either, and this is a problem.My guess is thatour Prime Minister wrestles some kind of deal from Brussels, the vast majority of the country will heave an enormous sigh of relief.We can all get on with our lives. Boris can busy himself with building very large bridges across the Irish Sea. Whatever deal he gets, it won’t be a proper Brexit.I have always said, right from day one, that our liberal establishment would never let us leave.And the sort of deal Boris is inching towards now will not be what we might call a full Brexit.It will involve, at the least, selling out the Northern Irish. Over the blessed “backstop”. And here’s the problem for Johnson.If he does that there will still be a large contingent of people very unhappy indeed — and not just the DUP.It means he won’t be able to strike a meaningful deal with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.And that, in turn, means the ­Conservative Party will go into the next election, which is coming very soon, with only a slender hope of victory.The Brexit Party is likely to take enough votes from the Tories to ensure they do not win.That would mean — at best — a hung parliament. And you can bet some sort of coalition deal will be struck between Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.This would result in a rejection of any deal. And almost certainly a second ­referendum on whether we should leave or not.Except that the choices on the ballot paper next time will be gerrymandered to ensure Remain wins .But what  is Boris to do We can’t leave with No Deal — the best option of those available right now — because ­Parliament won’t let him. His hands are tied.He started well in the job, did old BoJo. But things have fallen apart in the past two weeks.He hasn’t helped himself by estranging the Remainers in his party by kicking them out.Evenwe won’t miss them for a fraction of a nanosecond.And he should have been in Brussels from day one, negotiating.If only to show the British public the sheer bloody-minded intransigence and spite of the European Union.Still,he manages to wrench some sort of deal now, at the last moment, I’d be tempted to be in favour of it.Not because it’s what I voted for. But because it’s probably the least worst of all available options.Andhe then loses an election and the present Opposition revokes the deal, all hell will break loose.Yes, whatever way you look at it, this business is going to drag on and on. Until we’re all bored into stupefaction.THE BBC is in trouble after it accidentally showed some rude comments on screen.They were running a piece about cyber- trolling.And they showed a clip of plus-size model Jada Sezer, with a comment from online saying: “I want to **** you’re ***”.People have complained about the BBC’s low standards. And rightly.It should be “I want to **** YOUR ***”, not “you’re”.AT last the toxic little hobgoblin John Bercow is to stand down.The Speaker of the House of Commons will not be fighting his seat at the next election.This may well be because the Tories have announced they will stand against him.

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic. What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether. That would mean thwarting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, evenhe can only offer No Deal, which could easily result in Corbyn entering No.But any No Deal damage would be minimal and ­temporary.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

agreed to a move that could pave the way for a Brexit deal.The Times reported the party accepted some changes that would see Northern Ireland sticking to some European Union rules post-Brexit.But it would be a new deal to replace the hard Irish backstop, a sticking point for many in the Brexit negotiations.The paper claimed the DUP, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.A point it had previously said was unacceptable as it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland.It was claimed that inBrussels would let go of its insistence Northern Ireland stays in a customs union with the EU.Leader Arlene Foster tweeted the party would be keen to see a sensible deal but added not one that ides the internal market of the UK.She was adamant: We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.The source told The Times the move had been described as signicant, but urged a deal was a long way off.This proposal is said to have been talked over on Monday when Mr Johnson had a meeting with Leo Varadkar, the Irish Prime Minister.Earlier this week we told how Mr Johnson ruled out a Northern Ireland only backstop after an Irish EU chief said chances of a Brexit deal are rising.The backstop, the most controversial element of Theresa May’s deal, has been a constant stumbling block in Brexit negotiations.But the PM was handed a boost this week when Phil Hogan, a nominee for EU trade commissioner,  said the “penny had dropped” after he suggested an “all-Ireland” farming market after our orce from the bloc.He later told RTE: I also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position…where hes now prepared to look at ergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom.So I think theres movement happening on both sides.Under the plan, Northern Ireland would match Irish and EU rules in certain sectors after Brexit to avoid the need for a hard border.The idea mimics a compromise offer The Sun revealed European capitals were brainstorming - where the province would mirror Brussels on animal and plant health.The PM’s comments came after he had crunch Brexit talks with DUP boss Arlene Foster and the party’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds in No on Tuesday.Foster said they had a “very good meeting” and the government would not back the idea of a northern Irish backstop because it would not have “unionist consent”.Mr Johnson was also warned against breaking the law over Brexit by Speaker John Bercow, who vowed creativity in Parliament would scupper a no-deal exit.The warning came as the EUs chief negotiator said there is no reason to be optimistic that a new agreement can be brokered before the Prime Ministers deadline to ask for a delay.Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European Parliament on Thursday he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK Government would result in a deal by mid-October.The PM is legally bound to ask Brussels for an extension to Article he cannot get MPs to back a deal by October , after Parliament approved legislation designed to prevent a no deal.And this week Scotlands highest civil court ruled on Wednesday that the prorogation was unlawful because it was obtained for the improper purpose of stymying Parliament.Mr Johnson said the High Court in England had taken the opposite view to the Court of Session in Edinburgh and that the case would now be decided in the Supreme Court.He also insisted he was very hopeful that he could secure a deal by the EU summit starting on October ."},{"url":null,"title":"colourised pictures victorian london charles dicken","story":"The expertly colourised snaps

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either.

And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done dferently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next.I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners.

I worry about it a lot.Mr Cameron has been heavily criticised by many for calling the isive poll that has split the country - but he said he was left with no choice as the issue was not going to go away.He said: This issue needed to be addressed and I thought a referendum was coming, so better to try to get some reforms we needed and have a referendum.But I accept that, you know, that effort failed.I do understand some people are very angry because they didn’t want to leave the EU. Neither did I.He insisted that calling a referendum was not a decision he took in any way lightly.He said: I thought about it more than any other decision I took, because I knew it was an enormous decision.But it seemed to me that there was a genuine problem between Britain and the EU with the eurozone crisis and the development of the euro that needed fixing.There was also – I don’t deny it for a second – a huge political pressure to have a referendum, partly because we’d had treaty after treaty and promise after promise, and this issue was not going to go away.Mr Cameron said that Remain lost as they ended up with very strong technical and economic arguments while those in support of Leave had a very powerful emotional argument.He said: I think the issue of immigration plus that emotional argument was a winning combination for them.The argument about control, it resonated with people, and when you asked them, ‘Well, what is it we’re going to control ’ it was this issue of immigration.Mr Cameron reserved his most stinging criticism forclose friend Michael Gove and fellow ex Etonian Mr Johnson.He said: It turned into this terrible Tory psychodrama and I couldn’t seem to get through.What Boris and Michael Gove were doing was more exciting than the issues I was trying to get across. I felt like I was in a sort of quagmire by the end.Boris had never argued for leaving the EU, right  Michael was a very strong Eurosceptic, but someone whom I’d known as this liberal, compassionate, rational Conservative ended up making arguments about Turkey [joining] and being swamped and what have you.They were trashing the government of which they were a part, effectively.After losing the referendum Mr Cameron admitted he was left feeling miserable and was subjected to abuse from Remainers.On a second referendum, he said: I dont think you can rule it out because were stuck.Askedhe would campaign for another poll, Mr Cameron replied: Im not saying one will happen or should happen. Im just saying that you cant rule things out right now because youve got to find some way of unblocking the blockage.He described a No Deal Brexit as a bad outcome.He added: I very much hope it doesn’t happen.

Shane Moore condemned allegations that his mum Margaret, , was not the victim of domestic abuse as “a joke” and “all wrong”. Shane, who works in Monaco on the French Riviera, also revealed she is too ill to talk. Domestic violence charities have been appalled by the decision to give cricket legend Boycott, , a knighthood.It was awarded to the former England captain in Theresa May ’s resignation honours list.   A French judge who convicted Boycott said she stands by the guilty verdict. The Yorkshireman was convicted in  of assaulting Ms Moore in a hotel in France two years previously. She was left with black eyes. A court was told he hit her  times. The retired judge, Dominique Haumant, who said Boycott’s conduct in court was “arrogant” and “deplorable”, added: “I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. He doesn’t deserve it.” Boycott has always denied he assaulted Ms Moore.    Reacting to the fury at the knighthood, he said he “couldn’t give a toss”. He was first convicted in his absence. Boycott successfully appealed to have the verdict set aside and he was in court for a second trial. It was presided over by Ms Haumant who has reportedly said: “His version was Madame Moore had fallen on the carpet... I remarked ‘she didn’t get two black eyes falling on the thick carpet of a luxury hotel’. “He claimed it was an accident, but... I thought he was guilty and I stand by that.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email When Nicola Owst found a Staffordshire bull terrier abandoned and close to death she didn’t think twice about saving him. But what she didn’t know then was that her new buddy would save her too – by freeing her from her past. The brave dog would also go on to become a social media star and capture the hearts of dog lovers everywhere. Here, in an extract from her new book, Saving Buddy, Nicola shares their story of survival, hope and love.His poor sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face and just trying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. The skin around his filthy, swollen muzzle was pockmarked and livid pink where his fur had worn away. Blood under his right eye had soaked down his face and neck and on to his body, and his skeletal bird-like legs showed every sinew.  He was barely alive and every movement was agonising for him. It was April  and I’d travelled from Leicestershire with my stable-owner friend, Sally, and her daughter, Charlie, to collect two unwanted foals from a couple of shady-looking men in a junkyard just outside London. We’d just finished loading the horse-box when Charlie spotted a dog wedged into a cat carrier, inside a rusty crate. He was barely breathing – clinging on to le. So I freed the cat box and carefully lted him out of his prison. He was some kind of staffy and his terribly scared face showed he’d endured the most dreadful mistreatment. Had he been in illegal dog fights  He’d been left to die in his own waste. The stench of rotting flesh and faeces was unbelievable. His paw pads were red raw from standing in his own urine. What sort of monster could leave an animal is such a state  When I lted his limp body on to my lap, his legs buckled beneath him. I gently swaddled him in a towel. “I’ve got you now, buddy,” I whispered to him. And from that moment on he was known as Buddy.  We set off home but I feared he might not survive the journey and kept saying “Hang in there, Buddy.” We drove straight to the vet who took one look at Buddy and shook his head. It was the worst case of neglect he’d ever seen. Buddy was riddled with demodectic mange. The infection had eaten his skin and his weakened immune system meant he couldn’t fight it. The next  hours would be critical. Armed with antibiotics and a treatment for his skin, we went home. I half-filled the kitchen sink with water, added anti-bacterial shampoo and lowered Buddy in. I gently bathed away the foul dirt and grime as he sat there, placidly. Bit by bit, his lovely, splodgy brown and black brindle markings became clearer, and the real Buddy started to be revealed. This was possibly the first tender care he’d ever been given. I talked to him the whole time, telling him what a brave boy he was. It broke my heart to think about how scared he must have been, abandoned in that crate to die. Once he was clean, I wrapped him up in a big fluffy towel and patted him dry. I then cooked him some mini-fillets of chicken and a sachet of rice. I knewhe ate something, he would stand a better chance of making it through the night. Next morning Buddy seemed perkier. He tried to stand and walk towards me like a wobbly Bambi, but his back legs were too weak and his paws were agony. I went to Asda and bought some baby socks, padded the soles with cotton wool to cushion his paw pads and kept them on with sticky tape. The next time he wobbled on to his feet, he stayed upright for a few more seconds. It was a step in the right direction. And I did some research on Staffordshire bull terriers and was reassured to read they’re a lot softer than their fearsome reputation suggests.    I was going through a break-up at the time and, looking back, it feels asBuddy was sent to give me new focus. I needed help too. I felt very raw and vulnerable, unwanted and rejected. The moment Buddy looked at me with those pleading eyes, I knew he wanted me as much as I wanted him. By healing him, I was healing myself of heartache. I rescued Buddy that day but he also rescued me. Day by day he grew stronger and started to put on weight, but it was a long process. The raw, pink boy I’d rescued started to sport a summer coat. As I massaged his velvet-soft ears, he’d close his eyes in pleasure and wag his tail. I didn’t feel alone as I was so unconditionally loved by my little ball of energy. I had spent so long with loser boyfriends and shed too many tears when relationships had failed. But now I had a fantastic companion who’d be there for me through thick and thin. I was a manager at a job centre and in July  we got some new recruits. We were a similar age and got on well and would all go out for a drink. One of them, Jon Owst, was really nice and I enjoyed chatting to him. He was tall with dark hair, lovely blue eyes and a kind way – eager to hear all about my twin passions: Buddy and horses. We became friends and, six months later, Jon asked me on a date. It was lovely, but I’d gone on about Buddy so much Jon could be in no doubt it was a case of love me, love my dog. To my surprise he asked me out again and we took Buddy to the park. It was a fantastic day – the start of something special. Jon was a breath of fresh air and quickly became a new dad to Buddy. It made me realise how self-centred my recent ex-boyfriend had been. Buddy made me realise le is too short to be with someone who only cared about themselves. In August  Jon popped the question and presented me with a beautul ring. I said yes, straight away. We got married on Easter Sunday, . Our wedding was perfect. Buddy had a gorgeous garland of flowers in the coral wedding colours and he starred in many of the wedding photos.    But two years later I was cuddling Buddy and noticed a hard swelling on his back left ankle – the size of a large broad bean. The vet didn’t think it looked sinister. But I had a niggling feeling it was serious and Jon insisted I take Buddy back to the vet. He sent Buddy for an X-ray and “to have some cells tested.” I went into panic, worrying Buddy had cancer. Five days after the tests the vet rang. And the only word I heard was “tumour”. I couldn’t bear it, not after everything we’d been through, after his terrible start in le. Jon hugged me and tried to put my mind at rest. We went to the surgery. The vet said the tumour was in an awkward place and Buddy needed an specialist. Whatthe cancer had spread into Buddy’s leg. Would it mean amputation to save his le  The op went well. But the surgeon wasn’t % certain he’d removed all of the tumour. Buddy had to have radiotherapy and eight doses of chemotherapy. But how were we going to pay for it  I’d got pet insurance after rescuing Buddy, but with cancer costs rocket and there was very little in the pot.   I was desperately worried. We hadn’t been in our new house long and had no savings. But I’d created a Facebook page called Buddy Dog – The Rescue Staffy, to spread the word that staffies are lovely dogs.I posted about his treatment and the more I shared, the more Buddy’s friends increased.Friends suggested I set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds towards the treatment. And, amazingly, within weeks, we had raised the £ needed. When Buddy had his final round of chemo it was such a relief. It looked as though he would again be the incredible personality we knew and loved. But during Buddy’s cancer scare, we found out I was expecting. I had terrible morning sickness and Buddy knew there was something wrong with me. He’d sit next to me with his head tilted, a worried frown on his face. And I told him everything – as I always had. But eight weeks into the pregnancy, I woke up and sensed something was wrong. I turned to Jon and said: “I think the baby’s gone.” A scan confirmed it two days later, I had an operation to have the pregnancy removed. I was terribly upset but knew it wasn’t uncommon. A few months later I was pregnant for a second time – but miscarried again early on. When it happened a third time I was utterly devastated. Surely there must be something wrong with me  But the gt of morning sickness was delivered again, in the autumn of .

The former public schoolboy also admitted getting “off his head” on dope at Eton and smoking it again later with we Samantha and her friends. His confession came in a bombshell interview with The Times to plug his ­autobiography, For The Record, which is published next Thursday Mr Cameron also told how the Leave campaign’s Brexit victory left him depressed – but there was no apology for the mayhem his decision to hold a ­isive referendum has since caused.    In the book he accuses Mr Johnson and Mr Gove of behaving “appallingly” as the Brexit campaign became “this terrible Tory psychodrama”. He whined: “I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other.

He said: “Boris thought he was going to lose. “When he made the decision to back Leave he said, ‘Brexit will be crushed.’ ” Talking of Mr Johnson’s ambition, he added: “I think he was genuinely torn, but I came to the conclusion in the end that it was too tempting not to run that campaign and go that way.” As revealed in yesterday’s Mirror, Mr Gove bears the brunt of Mr Cameron’s unprecedented attack. He even branded the former ­Education Secretary a “w****r” over his reluctance to change jobs in a reshuffle. Mr Cameron had decided to demote Gove to Chief Whip after years of rocky relations with teachers. But when he refused to budge, Cameron said, he text him: “You are either a team player or a w****r.” In the interview, Mr Cameron complained he was “miserable about giving up the job I loved and working for the country I loved”. He said he was “hugely depressed about it”. But he still refused to accept ­responsibility for unleashing the chaos and paving the way for the current crisis in which the country is mired.  Mr Cameron, who insisted he is not in favour of no-deal, said: “Every single day I think about it, the ­referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done dferently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next. “I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it’s painful for the country and it’s painful to watch.” Pointing to “all those people who wanted a referendum”, he accepted many would never forgive him for ordering an In-Out vote. But he admitted to being accosted in the street by angry electors furious at what has unfolded.  Mr Cameron said: “You get lots of dferent reactions. “What I tried to do in the book was explain why I felt this was inevitable.” The multi-millionaire claimed he worries “desperately about what is going to happen next”. He also accepted a second Brexit referendum could be on the cards. Mr Cameron added: “I don’t think you can rule it out because we’re stuck.” As PM, he held three ­referendums in five years – a  poll on electoral reform, a  Scottish independence ballot and Brexit. Speaking about his personal relationship with Mr Johnson, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve had issues. “Even before Brexit there were tensions and ­disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well.” He also laid into Mr Johnson for axing  Tory rebels who voted against his no-deal bid and for suspending Parliament to avoid ­scrutiny over his plans. He said: “Taking the whip from MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things.”Mr Cameron said he contacted his successor Theresa May as she ­negotiated with Brussels while boxed in by her self-imposed red lines on the withdrawal agreement.He added: “I remember frequently texting her about the frustration of getting a Brexit deal and then seeing Brexiteers vote it down possibly at the risk of the whole project they had devoted themselves to. Maddening. And infuriating. There’s an argument that Brexit is just impossible to deliver and no one could have done, and there’s an argument that, well, wrong choices were made.” As Mr Cameron prepares for his book launch, Mr Johnson was askedhe was worried about what would be written about him in it. The PM, who branded Mr Cameron a “girly swot” in leaked papers, replied: “Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.” Cameron on Gove Michael Gove is branded a liar by Mr Cameron and described as “mendacious” over things he said during the referendum campaign. He said: “I think what I say is that over the issue of whether or not we had a veto over Turkey, and over the issue of the £million on the bus, I think they left the truth at home.” Askedthe pair are still speaking, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve spoken. Not a huge amount. I’ve sort of had a conversation with him. I’ve spoken to the Prime Minister a little bit, but Michael was a very good friend. So that has been more dficult.”  aposIssuesapos with Boris David Cameron has spoken candidly about his relationship with Boris Johnson. The former Prime Minister said of the current Premier: “We’ve had issues.” He paints a damning picture of Mr Johnson as someone who would arrive late at vital emergency COBRA meetings. Mr Cameron also explained how he tried to pe rsuade his friend to back Remain by suggesting he was likely to succeed him in No . He also offered him a top-five Cabinet job – hinting at the position of Defence Secretary.

They made Britain a wealthy nation and offered good working-class jobs you could build a le on. But when those industries closed, the jobs that replaced them were low-paid and insecure.  Then after the financial crisis, communities that were already down took another a kicking from a decade of austerity.It’s time to do right by our towns again.

Firstly, invest in our towns to attract good employers and create decent jobs. That means modern transport links and new centres of green industry across the UK. We can win the battle against climate change and create great new jobs while we’re at it. And we need a National Investment Bank to target investment to towns where good jobs are in short supply.Secondly, the next government must rebuild public services.  Austerity has done deep harm to Britain. And the worst damage is to towns that were already struggling.Every town needs good schools and hospitals, safe neighbourhoods and truly affordable homes. So in this election, let’s hear about long-term plans to fund all of our services properly. And that means restoring what was cut in full. Finally, politicians must give back power to workers.The industries that once made these towns wealthy had strong unions. But in recent decades, working people have been silenced.

He bravely spoke toabout his anger issues after failing to deal with his grief. And he says he struggled to find the courage to speak out and access help.  His issues came to a head when he lost his job abroad and was forced tohome but could no longer live with his dad.  Aaron ended up living on the streets before finding a place to stay at the YMCA.  “I did good in my GCSEs, went to college and studied public services,” he said. “I didn’t have a good home le, I lost my mum when I was young and nothing felt right in my head after that. Nothing was the same.  “I did grieve a lot, I was very angry and out of control, breaking everything up and taking my temper out on people.  “It still sticks with me now.”    Despite his struggles, Aaron said he was “too stubborn” to try and speak to someone and tried to deal with his issues alone.  “You feel like you’re the only one in that circle or bubble that you’re in who knows anything about it. It’s quite personal so opening up to people takes a while,” he said.  “When I did speak to people I felt no one really took it on board, they tell you: ‘yeah, you’ll be alright’. But you don’t really say that to someone.” After finishing his studies Aaron went to work in Calais where he had an eight-month contract working for an activity centre.  But his mental health started to decline when his contract wasn’t renewed.  He said: “I just gave up because I hated everything and nothing was going right for me.

I was depressed before and then that spiked it.”  He said he felt helpless and ashe had no one to turn to while he was homeless.  “I struggled to hold down a job too, I had a part-time job working two hours every morning and I was still doing it even though I was living in a tent,” he explains. “It was hard to stay clean like washing your clothes, and obviously you have from place to place because as soon as people know who you are they can come and trash it so you need to keep on top of that.  “So you’re constantly having to move place and I was asking my family membersI could move in but no one would.  “It felt like I was the black sheep of the family, that they were just pushing me away.” After spending two months living rough, Aaron went to Citizens Advice who helped him find a place to stay at the YMCA.

Sarah Dafner’s little boy Tzvi was only three months old when a case of the flu led to him suffering severe brain damage. The youngster, who is now , was just learning to roll over when he fell ill. On the third morning of his illness Tvizi didn’t wake up. He had stopped breathing and gone into cardiac arrest. Paramedics worked on Tzvi for almost half an hour before he finally started breathing again, but he had sustained massive brain damage. It left him unable to respond to stimuli, blind, in constant pain and having seizures that lasted all day and night. At the start of his illness Tzvi was spending three out of every four weeks in hospital because of infections and seizures. Sarah and husband Reuven, who live in Prestwich, were told there was not much that could be done apart from apostherapy and hopeapos. Sarah said: “His EEG showed no brain activity and Tzvi didn’t respond to stimuli. Not a sound came out of his mouth and he couldn’t bend his legs at all, even when unconscious. They were rigid.    “After that he started having seizures. We began trying dferent drugs with massive side effects and lots of hospital admissions. He was screaming in pain because his body was so stf and the seizures lasted all day long. We were literally living a day at a time.” The familyaposs consultant neurologist said she was worried about going on a summer holiday for fear of what she wouldto Two years ago the familyaposs fortunes finally began to change. The family GP showed Sarah a piece he had read about hyperbaric oxygen chambers. Sarah took Tzvi to a centre in Morecambe to undergo the treatment and the results changed Tzviaposs le. After just  sessions his seizures decreased dramatically and he started smiling for the first time in almost three years. The chamber works by allowing the user to breathe in  per cent oxygen, which is carried through the body to tissue starved of the gas. The treatment is most effective when it is used on consectuive days. While their is a chamber in Manchester, it is run by the Multiple Sclerosis Society and is only for adults, meaning the family currently face a five-hour round trip to Morecambe several times a week. Mum-of-six Sarah has been so struck by the change in her son since he started using the chamber that she is now fundraising to create one in Manchester that can be accessed by people of all ages. Sarah said: “Over the course of treatments his sight has also improved – and he can now track with his eyes – and he has also started responding vocally and interacting. His immune system, which was severely comprised by the pain medication, has also improved dramatically as has his bone density. In the last year he has only been in hospital four or four times.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man 21 stepped out front","story":"NewsMan, , stepped out in front of train  hours after breaking off engagementAmbitious and popular Jacob Standbridge, , was pronounced dead at Sandbach railway station in Cheshire shortly after his relationship endedShareCommentsByTimothy Gallager:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsJacob proposed to Ciera Barnes in  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Jacob Standbridge, , died under the wheels of the high speed passenger locomotive after he texted his mother saying: aposI love you mum so much. Thank you for everything you have done for me. I’m so sorry’. Jacob - also known as Jake - suffered multiple injuries in the .am impact on October  last year at Sandbach railway station in Cheshire and died at the scene. He had split up with fiancée Ciera Barnes the previous evening after he became upset about texts he found on her phone but a coroner ruled it was not clear whether he intended to take his own le. An inquest heard the sports teacher from Sandbach had played in midfield for the Stoke City Academy and other clubs.    After studying a BTECH in sports management he was offered a job providing sports training programs for local schools. He proposed to Ciera during a trip to New York in  and the pair bought a house together. But an inquest heard their relationship became troubled around the same time he began taking steroid injections. His mother Karen told the Warrington hearing: aposaposSometime in January  Jacob met Ciera, although he had had lots of casual girlfriends she was his first love and became part of the family. aposaposBut it seemed to be in the last seven to eight weeks of his le that things with Ciera became rocky, and this coincided with the period he started to use steroid injections.  The mother said the pair almost cancelled a holiday over texts that Jacob found but worked through the situation. She told the inquest that Jacob had called her on the evening of October  to say it was over between him and Ciera, before he came over to the house.  She said that around .am the following morning she heard someone downstairs and saw Jacob reversing his car off the drive. She then received a text about an hour later saying: ‘I love you mum so much thank you for everything you have done for me, I’m so sorryapos, the hearing was told.  The text was the last message she received from him.    Mrs Standbridge added: aposaposJacob was always on the go and was very popular with the kids and the head teachers, a number of schools refused to have anybody . He was extremely ambitious and driven but also loving and extremely proud of what he achieved. He was well respected by the staff, governors and parents. He told me on the Friday he had a meeting with Premier Sports who were offering a free franchise. “He applied for the apprentice and made it through to the final selection. He did compare himself to how others were doing on social media and this was an added pressure but I feel at that what happened was totally out of character for Jacob. At the time of his death he wasn’t in his right mind for whatever reason and I feel that he wanted to be out of pain in that moment - I firmly believe that. “When he left the house he was dressed in shorts and a hoodie and he hated the cold and I believe he was going back to Ciera to sort things out.aposapos "},{"url":null,"title":"man climbs station wall runs","story":"NewsMan climbs station wall and runs down tracks after assaulting security guardBritish Transport Police were called to Laindon station in Essex during rush hour last night following reports that a man had assaulted a security guardShareByJoe Morgan:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-climbs-wall-runs-down-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Lottie Fellows is like most other -year-old woman studying accounting and finance at the University of Bath, accept that she has a lucrative side hussle. She uploads videos of herself whispering onto Youtube, where some have fetched as many as , views. Lottie is a master in the art of autonomous sensory meridian response or ASMR. When some people hear a voice whispered so as to be on the cusp of audible, they get a tingling sensations in parts of their body. The noise can make some feel relaxed and sleepy or, alternatively, very on edge.    For Lottie, her relationship with ASMR began in primary school, when a teacher softly reading her class a book gave her the tingles. Her mum put her onto the then emerging whispering scene in early , suggesting the student might be able to harness it to improve her mental health and sleep. As soon as she watched on video she was hooked. Lottie made her own channel in September of that year.    At first her subscriber count grew slowly as she struggled with the filming and editing process. A year on however, she has , subscribers and millions of views split across  videos. “I was shocked when my channel began to grow, it was very surreal, she said. “I remember watching my videos back and cringing a bit, so knowing others were enjoying it was a surprise.” In her videos Lottie greets her viewers by whispering hello my darlings.    She then adopts a character, whether that be a doctor or a stylist. While the aim of the video is to sooth and relax, some people have misinterpreted the sensual display Lottie offers as sexual. “When people say ASMR is sexual I respond with the argument that anything can be sexualized, she said.  I can understand why slow whispering or the words ‘roleplay’ can be misinterpreted as being sexual, and there are some female creators who show a bit of cleavage to get more views.

As they embrace and discuss what ice cream they will have, they look like any other couple in the first throes of love. But they have already been married  years – after becoming the first Down’s syndrome couple in the UK to tie the knot in . They have enjoyed the longest marriage of anybody with the condition and everyone who knows them says their romance is like a “fairytale”. Maryanne, , says: “I love him. I loved him from the first time I met him.”    And pointing towards his wedding ring, Tommy, , adds: “I wear this every day. I married her, I did.” From their daily walks on the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, to rustling up something special in the kitchen, they have done everything together since meeting at a le skills training centre in July . Sadly, Tommy lost both parents by  and was in residential care – but Maryanne’s family took him under their wing.After  months, Tommy bought a plastic ring from a vending machine and, having asked permission from Maryanne’s mum, Linda Martin, he popped the question. Linda, , says: “When I sent out the invitations people said it wouldn’t last and asked me what I’d doit didn’t.   But we need to treat Tommy and Maryanne like adults. Everyone should be able to marry the love of their lives.” The big day itself was certainly something to remember as  family and friends gathered at church in . Maryanne says: “We got married on July . I had a white dress and I wore a crown like a princess.And Tommy was in a suit with a shirt and tie. My wedding day was the best day of my le. I love my husband. He is my best friend.” Maryanne and Tommy then moved in with Linda before getting their own flat, next door, in .   Linda says: “They would talk all the time, from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep. I had to bang on the wall because they’d be in hysterics. “They also cooked with me every night and I taught them the basics of how to make fresh dinners. These two are marvellous in the kitchen. That’s where Tommy gets into his element.” When we visit Tommy and Maryanne in their flat, their pride shines through. Maryanne says: “I clean it every day.” The couple’s love for music is also apparent, as the apartment is crammed with Elvis memorabilia. There is even wallpaper with the King’s face and a cuckoo clock that plays his songs. So it comes as no surprise when Tommy sings Love me Tender to his we. “I sing this to her every day,” he says. “I sang it when we got married too.”    Maryanne nods while cradling a heart-shaped locket containing a photo of them with their names engraved. The couple renewed their vows on their th wedding anniversary in , in front of  people. And every year, they are keen to celebrate their anniversary and show the world their love. But devastatingly, Tommy may not be able to remember their th anniversary next year. He was diagnosed with dementia five years ago and already struggles to do day-to-day tasks like tying his shoelaces or washing his hair.Heartbreakingly, he also sometimes forgets who Maryanne is. If he continues to decline, her family fear they may be forced to separate for the first time.    Maryanne’s sister Lindi Newman, , says: “He’s forgotten who Maryanne is a handful of times. He pushes her away and says, ‘I don’t know who you are’ and ‘I don’t love you’.Maryanne takes that to heart and is hysterical. She calls me and I go across the road to calm them down. It’s scary for Tommy too but then he forgets anything has happened. “We tell her Tommy forgets things because his brain’s a bit poorly and he’s getting older.But we take each day as it comes because we’ve been toldTommy needs residential care, Maryanne wouldn’t be able to go with him. We’d do whatever we could to stop it happening.” Maryanne is also determined to do everything she can to help Tommy. Lindi says: “Tommy can’t put his own shoes on or fasten his jewellery or watches. Maryanne also helps him in and out of the bath, helps get him get dressed and things like that.”Maryanne chips in: “I tell him I love him three times a day. We have kisses and cuddles. I do all I can.” And this is clear to see when we head to the beach, as she grabs Tommy’s hand and leads him in the right direction. “Come on, Tom,” she grins as they point out their favourite lunch spots and pubs. “We just like spending time together,” she adds. “Sometimes we get an ice cream and a shandy.” And when Tommy stumbles, Maryanne is right there to support him. “Easy, tiger,” she laughs as she steadies him.  The pair are working to make new memories and will go to Disneyland this summer with Lindi and her family. Lindi says: “Next year, when Maryanne and Tommy reach  years, my husband and I will have been married  and my mother-in-law and father-in-law  – so we have a huge celebration planned with all the family going on holiday.Every year they have together is special and we make the most of it. And I always take lots of photos and have them put into an album for Tommy to help his memory.”Devoted Tommy and Maryanne have also won the hearts of , Facebook followers.Lindi says: “There’s just so much love that comes through there. Tommy and Maryanne have set the bar throughout their relationship. It’s literally a fairytale."},{"url":null,"title":"van driver caught waving phone","story":"NewsVan driver caught waving phone in the air while driving along dual carriagewayEXCLUSIVE: The man was spotted travelling along the A, near Oxford - a stretch of road that has seen numerous fatal crashes in recent yearsShareCommentsByRachel Endley :,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video van-driver-hold-phone-above-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Broganaposs condition gradually got worse and she started to suffer from generalised seizures up to  times per day. The horric symptoms meant could not be left alone with food as she would often choke.  The seizures also caused Brogan to have dangerous accidents with one resulting in  stitches to her face. Brogan said: At one point I was having up to  seizures a day and was having accidents. One time I was washing up, we had porcelain plates that everyone has and I had seizure. The plate broke and cut my face and I had to have  stitches. I have a scar, but you can hardly see it as the facial surgeon did an amazing job. There was also the time I had a kettle in my hand and had a seizure. I poured the boiling water all over myself and burnt myself. Due to her condition, Brogan was unable to have a bath due to the possibility of her drowningshe had a seizure. She was also not able to shower unsupervised as that too became a drowning hazard when she blocked the plug with her shoulder during one episode. However, Broganaposs le changed when she got her seizure alert dog, Wadsley. She said: “My le before Wadsley was miserable and I was depressed as hell.    “I was on medication but it wasn’t working, nothing was working. I knew what le was like before and I wanted that back. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t have a bath or a shower in case I had a seizure and drowned or fell and banged my head. I couldn’t cook or leave the house, so many of things that people take for granted I wasn’t allowed to do any more. Brogan applied to Support Dogs, a charity that provide, train and support specialist assistance dogs when she was -years-old. However, due to huge demand the programme was closed at that time and she didn’t hear anything for two years. After applying to a number of charities, Brogan was about to give up on her chance of getting a seizure alert dog. However, that week she received a phone call from Support Dogs saying they had a Labrador who could be trained to pick when Brogan was about to have a seizure via his sense of smell. They claim the amazing dog can give Brogan a  and a half minute warning before she has an episode. This allows the -year-old to either get home or get to a safe place quickly before she has a seizure, whether that is a disability toilet or changing room. Her new found independence thanks to Wadsley allows Brogan to play rugby with the consent of her GP. She said: Wadsley can still detect a seizure even though he can’t see me.

But some social media users were horried to discover a piece of punctuation aposmissingapos from a sign outside of the prestigious building in London. A photo of the sign, which is intended to advertise whataposs inside the library, was shared on Twitter by a user named Dr Peter Hornsby. His post quickly went viral, garnering over , likes and more than , retweets - but can you see what people thought was wrong with the sign   Dr Hornsby captioned his post: Great advert from the British Library. The sign reads: Shops. Cafés. The whole wealth of human knowledge, endeavour and experience to date. Events. Exhibitions. And while many might think this is perfectly fine, others were quick to argue that the British Library should have included an Oxford comma after the word endeavour. The controversial piece of punctuation is typically used as the final comma in a list of three or more things to help prevent confusion, being placed before the words aposandapos or aposorapos.  People on Twitter were ided over whether or not it should have been used here. One person replied, saying: Love it! But where is the Oxford comma      Another wrote: The lack of the Oxford comma is killing me. A third added: Of all the places, I would expect the British Library to employ an Oxford comma.  However, others didnapost think the piece of punctuation needed to be used in this instance. Someone  said: I don’t think an Oxford comma is necessary in this particular sentence it isn’t ambiguous. Besides, isn’t it an americanism  A second thought the Oxford comma was optional here. Whatever your stance on it, the British Library didnapost seem too bothered about not having used the Oxford comma. A spokesperson told MailOnline they had received a very positive response after the sign went up earlier this month.

It’s harder for the defence when you move it quickly from side to side because there will be a gap in the defence some time.“As well as moving it quicker, you have to be patient to wait for that gap to appear.”Marshall was given a break by manager James McPake for the - Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin City last Sunday and is keen to get back on the pitch come tomorrow.“I wasn’t playing on Sunday, the gaffer said I could head home and see some family and get a rest, but when I came back the feeling was positive around the place, to be honest,” he added.“I don’t think we need to dwell too much on it. We’ve had a couple of bad results but it’s happened, it’s over and it’s about putting it right tomorrow.“If you look over the whole start to the season, it’s been a decent start.“The derby was obviously a night to forget but we have three more derbies this season and we’ll be looking to put that right later on in the season.”On being rested, he added: “I want to be playing every week but we have a good squad with two good players for every position. The gaffer needed to see Sean Mackie play as well so, fair enough, I respect his decision.“It’s always good to have a bit of competition.”Dundee picked up six clean sheets in their opening eight matches of the season and rediscovering that will be key to getting back to form, says Marshall.Their inability to deal with set-pieces at Tannadice, too, took the left-back by surprise two weeks ago and the former Queen of the South man revealed improving that has been a key part of training lately.He added: “We’d kept a few clean sheets already this season and then conceding six was unacceptable, particularly at this club.“We need to get back to being solid and doing the basics right like we were doing when we were picking up so many clean sheets. We’ve been working on our set-pieces.“Usually we’ve been pretty solid from them this season. We need to put that right because we can’t defend like that.”And Alloa in the past have used their threat at set-plays to pick up some vital results in the Championship.Marshall added: “I haven’t seen much of Alloa this year but last season they were always organised and they scored from a few set-pieces against me when I was at Queens.“They are also a good footballing side and I’ve heard they are playing out from the back this season so they’ll probably come here and try to play football as well.“They are a part-time team but they were brilliant last year. They always seem to grind results out and we need to be aware of that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee university graduate admits drink driving following night out","story":"A Dundee University graduate has been banned from driving for  months after pleading guilty to drink driving.Abraham Fernandez, , admitted driving with an alcohol level of  microgrammes in  mililitres of breath on August  on Perth Road, near Ninewells Avenue.The Perth man attempted to drive home after becoming separated from friends on a night out.

He came in for pre-season looking sharp and really fit and he’s carried that right through into the league campaign,” said McMullan.“He’s been really good but that’s probably gone under the radar a wee bit with Shanks scoring however many goals he has, but Louis has been great.“I’m sure Shanks will say the same thing because Louis has been really good for him and they seem to work together very well.“It’s made things a bit more dficult for defences because there is two of them up there to worry about and that’s good for us.“The two of them complement each other very well and that’s what you want from your strikers. It’s good for the team.”As they look to continue what’s been a perfect start in the Championship with, four wins from four outings so far, tomorrow sees United head for Ayr United and potentially one of their toughest tests to date.McMullan is well aware last season Somerset Park was not a happy hunting ground.It saw United suffer two defeats that were signicant blows to their automatic promotion challenge.While he is determined to take three points this time, he expects to have to work hard for them.“They were dficult to play against last year and it will be the same again,” McMullan added.“They are direct and make the game really physical. You don’t really get a minute on the ball.“So you have to be ready to go against them andyou are not at it % then you will get beat.”Of course, one big plus this time round is that man Shankland being in tangerine instead of black and white.McMullan’s viewing that as a double bonus.“I think he scored six goals against us so it will be great that he is not up against us this time.“Having him in your team is brilliant. You just need to get it into the vicinity of the -yard box and the ball usually hits him and then goes in!”For the Terrors, the main priority is another win to keep the early season momentum going.While he admits his preference would have been for the league games to be coming thick and fast right now, he’s not too concerned about last week’s break for the Challenge Cup possibly interrupting the team’s flow.“The cup has kind of broken it up a bit for us. It was a bit inconvenient, to be honest, and it’s not the greatest cup as it is.“It kind of broke up our momentum but we are determined to pick up where we left off after the derby against Dundee.”“The positive side of the couple of breaks we’ve had since the league started is that they can give time for boys who’ve picked up knocks to recover properly and we’ll all be feeling fresh for this game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it.

There are a lot of hurdles you need to overcome and that is part of any player’s development, particularly when they are injured.“I am sure Scott will be fine.“With his last injury when he was out for two or three months everybody commented on how focused Scott was to come back.“He will need that discipline and temperament again to get over this type of injury.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25623775-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen charity could use electric bikes to help deliver food parcels","story":"Electric cargo bikes could be used to deliver food parcels to families in need as part of a new Aberdeen charity scheme.Community Food Initiatives North Eastis working on plans to introduce the delivery services to help reduce its carbon footprint.Residents suffering from ill health or mobility issues could benefit as well as single parents with several children.Food parcels will still be available to be picked up from the CFINE base on Poynernook Road.The charity is now looking for volunteers who would be interested in carrying out home deliveries on the bikes.Dave Simmers, chief executive of CFINE, said he had taken food to the homes of families who could not make it to the site in the past.He said: “I’ve been out delivering parcels to people who have phoned on a Friday afternoon and can’t get in to pick them up.“It’s not for everybody because we just can’t manage.“It’s for people who have mobility issues or for other reasons – for example, a lone parent with three children.”The charity hopes to use the bikes for smaller deliveries so it relies less on its diesel van, making the service more environmentally friendly.Dave added: “We’d be looking at them for our fare share scheme, for our fruit and vegetable deliveries and our new community food pantry.“There’s the social purpose, which is to help these people get home deliveries, but it’s also an alternative to our diesel van.“There’s a growing number of people who are concerned about the environment who it might appeal to.“It also promotes us as a green charity.”Anyone who might be able to help out is asked to contact the CFINE office on   or email info@cfine.org"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d668a497e6b59.78887505-651x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet harley basil and dexter and dakota are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This cheeky girl is  months old.

However, the city council said this could be reviewed at a later date.It is understood from sources close to the project that work should begin on the smaller Newton of Charleston development, comprising just  homes, by the end of this year.Meanwhile, construction work could begin on the wider Loirston development by the “tail end” of next year or into .Officers at Aberdeen City Council have produced an updating planning framework for the area which will be presented to the local authority’s planning committee next week.They have been asked to agree putting the proposals out to public consultation to give residents the chance to have their say.Councillor Sarah Duncan, who represents Cove, Nigg and Kincorth, urged the public to have their say in any future consultation.She said: “It is essential the revised framework goes out for public consultation as any development around Loirston Loch is of signicant interest to people living in Nigg, Redmoss, Cove and Kincorth.“There have been changes in the area since the original framework was published, not least Lochside Academy and Balmoral stadium, so it’s appropriate now that local people can see what might happen and comment on that.”The city council’s planning committee will be asked to approve the content of the development framework and to agree that the proposals go out to public consultation for a minimum of four weeks.The views of the public consultation would then be reported back to a future meeting of the committee within the next six months."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits, explained Shirley.ldquoWe hope there will be many more initiatives for community growing starting up in other Border towns and villages.It might be a wrap for the film crew, but these community horticulturists continue to work hard growing fresh fruit and vegetables in their tasty gardens throughout the year.ITV will be airing the show later this month, and being involved in the creation of a community garden which is fresh, free and enhances the environment is a worthy  minutes claim to fame."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-set-toast-peebles-highland-games","story":"FORMER athletics coach

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

And finally, perhaps most crucially, it should reveal something universal about le itself. Good memoirs have one or two of these attributes great memoirs possess them all.How many ndashany ndash will David Cameronrsquos hotly-anticipated book contain, I wonder  The former prime ministerrsquos memoir, For The Record, is due out in  daysrsquo time, which means by rights I should already be able to answer that question. It is normal protocol for editors and reviewers to be sent copies weeks, sometimes months, in advance, but this book is apparently so hot it will stay under lock and key until the release date of September .Does this mean Mr Cameron is about to spill the beans on Boris Johnson  Does he have something up his sleeve that could bring down his old Eton, Oxford and Bullingdon Club chum  Are we to take it the revelations contained in this book are so explosive they will cause another major tremor in what has been a summer of political earthquakes : Johnson called Cameron a girly swotI fear those of hoping for such an outcome will be let down. After all, with Mr Cameron reportedly paid pound, in advance for the book ndash therersquos also a TV series in the offing ndash itrsquos more likely his publishers are simply ensuring they get plenty of bang for their buck. Indeed,there was anyone left who believed Mr Cameron had been laying low over the last three years because he feels ashamed about the misery and chaos he has inflicted upon the rest of us by holding the EU referendum, the penny must surely have dropped that he is under contract to keep schtum.By rights, of course, this is a man who should, evenonly in print, fall on his knees and beg forgiveness from us all. So arrogant and wrong-headed was his decision-making that we now sit on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit that has the potential to cause economic, political and social misery. Not that wealthy, privileged, cosseted Mr Cameron and his family will suffer its effects, of course, just as he clearly didnrsquot feel any sympathy or responsibility towards the families and communities he and his government plunged into austerity from  onwards.Evenno-deal can be avoided, the damaging isions Mr Camerons referendum created and fed upon will last for generations. To say he changed his country for the worse is an understatement. As for the apology he owes the people of Libya, thatrsquos another can of worms.Andthe memoirs of his predecessors are anything to go by, rather than apology and candour, Mr Cameronrsquos tome will be filled with dull procedure, maddening attempts to deflect blame and crass legacy-making.As for the standard of writing, it will be interesting to seehe has more talent than some of the previous inhabitants of Number . Even that great verbal communicator Tony Blair revealed himself to be a terrible writer his  book overflowed with clicheacute and wince-inducing pop psychology. Werenrsquot there also some really bad sex scenes  Crucially, he refused to confront Iraq.:David Cameron toto political limelight next month to publicise his autobiography For The RecordGordon Brownrsquos memoir ndash with its ghastly title My Le, Our Times ndash was criminally dull, as was John Majorrsquos, which I remember reading on my sickbed in the early Noughties after picking it up in an actual bargain bin for p. I only read two volumes of Mrs Thatcherrsquos autobiography and can attest that despite the grand delusion, at least they werenrsquot boring.For a truly skilled and revelatory take on the political world, we must turn to those who surround the powerful. All three volumes of Alastair Campbellrsquos diaries make for scintillating reading, as do those of the late Tory MP Alan Clark. Neither Campbell nor Clark emerge as likeable people, yet both are talented writers who exude wit, humour and honesty in spades. Their books embed readers in their heads, shock us, and in dferent ways, tell us about the nature of power.Mr Cameronrsquos publishers claim he will ldquotalk candidly, though itrsquos hard to imagine this former PR man, who, in common with his pal Mr Johnson has never seemed burdened by self-doubt, will feel the need or inclination to explain himself to the likes of us. Sorry Dave ndash I fear the giant bargain bin in the ether awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-giant-gets-set-no-deal-brexit","story":"But it declared the long-term growth prospects for whisky around the world will not be impeded by the current upheaval caused by Brexit.Top executives of Chivas owner Pernod Ricard briefedjournalists yesterday at the distillerrsquos new head office on Glasgowrsquos Blythswood Square, which is now home to around  back office staff who have moved from its former headquarters in Paisley.Th maker of Ballantinersquos, Chivas Regal and Royal Salute is shting its bottling operation from Paisley to a ldquostate of the art facility in Dumbarton, where it has invested pound million in its Kilmalid site. The Kilmalid plant will be fully operational next year.Asked whether the distiller has prepared for a no-deal Brexit, Chivas chief executive Jean-Christophe Coutures, who appeared alongside executive chairman Alexandre Ricard and Christian Porta, chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, said: ldquoI canrsquot comment on the outcome of it . The only thing I would say is that, as a business, what we want is visibility. It is very dficult to forecast and to plan for the unknown.:Chivas owner lts profit forecasts for yearldquoNow we are firmly preparing for a no-deal Brexit, with the expectation that there will be a deal. It has always been our position, but we have to prepare for the worst.Mr Coutures said the distillerrsquos preparations involve ensuring it has sufficient supplies of glass, bottle closures and labels.He noted: ldquoWe are lucky enough in Pernod to have a very strong distribution network of sister companies, and in the last six months we have been moving finished goods inventory for key markets and SKUs , in particular the European Union, by increasing all inventory in those markets. It doesnrsquot impact our sell out terms, because it is internal .ldquoThe other point which is important to note is that we hardly use trucks in Chivas Bros. We mainly use ports and boats to transport our products, so we believe will be in a better place than others in that context.:Activist turns heat on whisky giant PernodObserving that it was impossible to predict the outcome of the political crisis, he added: ldquoThe only thing I know, [is that] we are ready, and I am firmly of the view that Scotch, no matter what, will continue growing, and I donrsquot expect any slowdown because of Brexit. I think the dynamics of the category remain extremely positive.However, Mr Ricard said there could be an effect on Scotch and Irish whiskey exportsUS President Donald Trump moves to impose tarfs on imports of European spirits.He said: ldquoThe US is a huge market for European spirits, particularly for Scotch, Irishand Cognac, so it would have somewhat of an impact of course.Mr Ricard declared the distillerrsquos Scotch whisky portfolio continues to be ldquobig driver of the firmrsquos financial performance. Pernod reported organic profit growth of . per cent in its  financial year, underpinned by growth of % on Chivas Regal, % for Ballantinersquos, % for The Glenlivet and % for Royal Salute.Mr Ricard said: ldquoLetrsquos be very clear: our Scotch business, which is the biggest part of our portfolio, is driving that growth, and we are extremely happy about it.While he observed that the .% growth in exports reported recently by the Scotch Whisky Association, to pound.bn in the first half of , reflected stock-building by some distillers, he said Pernodrsquos figures did not.Mr Ricard said: ldquoUnlike us, a lot of our competitors donrsquot have... sister companies inmarkets. It means they have been pushing inventories to third parties, which impacted, eventually, their sell-out.He added: ldquoIn thosenumbers, it is genuine numbers. Brexit or not Brexit, the numbers would have been exactly those.Mr Ricard downplayed the effects of the Hong Kong protests on sales in the special administrative region. He noted that the Hong Kong market is relatively small, and the only disruption occurs when the airport has been closed and sales of whisky are impeded in travel retail stores.Mr Ricard said the potential for exports to China remain strong, noting that on the basis of demographics, urbanisation trends and demand for whisky and Cognac, he is confident of achieving sales growth in high single digit to low double-digit percentage terms ldquofor the foreseeable future.Mr Coutures outlined Pernodrsquos commitment to invest poundm per year in Scotch whisky distilling, manufacturing and logistics. The investment includes plans to upgrade the visitor experiences at The Glenlivet and Strathisla distilleries on Speyside.With regard to Strathisla, the ldquooldest commercial distillery on Speyside, Mr Coutures said the aim is to ldquobring to le the story of Chivas and the distillery. ldquoOur approach will not be to do something large scale, with a multi-hundred-million [pound] investment, but to respect the distillery as it stands, he said.He added that plans for The Glenlivet will allow visitors to enjoy aspects of Scottish nature.

First we need to give councils the power of consent when someone proposes changing a home to a holiday home, and also we need to allow social home providers, community organisations and local authorities to purchase land at closer to the original value.ldquoWhen land is sold with planning permission or the perception that it will be used for housebuilding then you can add pound, on to the asking price, even for rough arable land.He added: ldquoSelling it for what it is actually worth, not to private builders but to councils and social housing providers, would allow more house to be built as budgets could be stretched further.Faisal Faisal Choudhry, director of Scottish Research and Residential Research at estate agents Savills, said that house price growth had not been as big a barrier to purchasing a home in rural areas as it has in the cities.Instead, the problem has been supply for the housing market and the number of new homes being built.He said: ldquoThe lack of houses in rural areas and the dficulty people experience purchasing a property is not because of house price growth, but because of a lack of choice.ldquoIf no new supply is coming on to the market then people are forced to stay renting or living with parents, and thatrsquos eventually not sustainable for young couples looking for their first home.He said that the amount of social housing being built had gone some way to alleviating the problem, but it still left people waiting months, or even years, to get the keys to their own home.Mr Choudhry said: ldquoWith social housing you have to be qualied to get on to the councilrsquos list, and it is means tested. And people can be waiting years in some cases.ldquoThey end up looking at areas where there are homes coming onto the market, such as Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and the Lothians, and move there.ldquoBut these places arenrsquot rural. People are faced with a choice: stay in the hope that something comes up, or up sticks and go to where the houses are.Three years ago, the Scottish government launched two projects, thepound million Rural Housing Fund and the poundm Islands Housing Fund, to provide grants and loans to groups building homes in areas where there is pressure on the housing market.According to the latest statistics from July, it has helped fund almost  homes, including new dwellings in Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney, the Highlands and Kinross.Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning, Kevin Stewart, said: ldquoWe remain on track to deliver at least , affordable homes by , including , for social rent, backed by record investment of more thanpound. billion. Our most recent official statistics show we have delivered more than , affordable homes since .ldquoThe poundm Rural and Islands Housing Funds were launched as part of wider housing policy to increase supply of long term affordable housing in rural areas.ldquoGiven the complex nature of rural housing projects, we extended the timescales for these funds from the initial three years to five to allowas many projects as possible to come forward.ldquoWe are also working to ensure those who aspire to home ownership are able to achieve it and over , households have been supported through our home ownership schemes since ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate-campaigners-call-set-tougher-targets","story":"The Climate Change Bill will go to final vote in the Scottish Parliament on September .Stop Climate Chaos Scotland ndash a coalition of more than  charities and civil society organisations ndash yesterday handed in an open letter signed by thousands of people to Holyrood.The note stated that, while Scotlandrsquos declaration of a climate emergency is apositive step forward, politicians must use the Bill to sign our commitment to action into law.

Although that was a very robust policing response it is not sustainable or desirable to constantly have -plus officers in full public order gear in the city streets every weekend.\"A moratorium on marches is being considered to \"find that right balance\" between the right to march and the need to protect the city, she added.\"What we need is some breathing space, we need to be able to step back.\"Ms Aitken continued: \"We need to understand the situation and the organisers of the traditional parades must engage in this as well.\"They need to step up and give some confidence and some guarantees that were not going to see a repeat of the violence of recent weeks, and at the moment I dont think anyone is convinced they are able to do that.\"She said advice from Police Scotland had warned of a \"risk\"this weekends marches went ahead.The council leader stated: \"Our only concern is about marches where there is this risk of unacceptable disruption to the le of the community. Other marches can go ahead.\"No-one wants to interfere with the right of citizens, the citys streets belong to the citizens and they are entitled to use them either to express an opinion or to celebrate a faith day or for whatever reason.\"But they cannot do thatthey are going to cause violence and unacceptable disruption to the lives of the city and to communities.\"At the moment there are some marches where the risk of that is very high, and until we get some kind of confidence and guarantee that we are not going to see a repeat of that then we need to step back for a bit and have a period without these marches.\""},{"url":null,"title":"support-welsh-independence-reaches-historic-high","story":"The YouGov poll, commissioned by Plaid Cymru, found % would back breaking away from the UK ndash rising to %excluding ldquodonrsquot knows ndash representing the highest level in polling history.Growing support for Welsh independence has led to a series of rallies recently held in Cardf, Caernarfon and Merthyr Tydfil, where thousands joined marches organised byAll Under One Banner Cymru.:Odds now clearly in favour of Scottish independence, says bookmakerPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the new poll represented a ldquohistoric high for dreams of an independent Wales, and accused figures in Westminster of ldquowrecking Walesrsquo future.Mr Price said: ldquoWestminster is in turmoil.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away. By next summer the plant should be quiet and there should be no smell.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/INVERNESS-CITY-SKYE-1-web.jpg","title":"portree high girls selected to join caley thistle","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKatherine Dibblefrom Breakish and Jenner Macleodfrom Raasay will travel through to the Highland capital for training and competitions.Katherine Dibble can operate as a playmaker, while Jenner MacLeod plays as a defender.

Then the idea is for people to go into local groups and talk about what they can do locally.#We will then have a picture of who is interested in doing what and come up with possibilities for people to link up and then we will try and work out where we can go from there.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.

We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK,” Mrs Foster tweeted.“We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.”She added: “Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The DUP’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, also rejected reports that the party was softening its stance, but said he had detected a dferent tone in talks between London and Dublin.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I think that there was a dferent attitude in the talks between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach at the beginning of the week and there seemed to be less rhetoric at those discussions from what there had been in the past.“And I suppose that’s progress.”Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has been warned against breaking the law over Brexit by Speaker John Bercow, who vowed that “creativity” in Parliament would scupper a no-deal exit.The comments drew sharp criticism from prominent Tory Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin, who said the Speaker had launched a personal attack on the Prime Minister.Mr Bercow’s intervention came as the EU’s chief negotiator said there is “no reason to be optimistic” that a new agreement can be brokered before the Prime Minister’s deadline to ask for a delay.Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European Parliament on Thursday that he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK Government would result in a deal by mid-October.The PM is legally bound to ask Brussels for an extension to Article he cannot get MPs to back a deal by October , after Parliament approved legislation designed to prevent a no-deal.Mr Barnier’s warning came after the PM was forced to deny lying to the Queen in order to secure his five-week suspension to Parliament as the Halloween departure deadline looms.Outgoing Commons Speaker Mr Bercow said in a London speech that the so-called Benn Act enforcing the extension means the only possible Brexit outcome is one approved by Parliament.The former Tory warned that it is “astonishing” that anyone has entertained the idea that the PM could disobey the law, after Mr Johnson said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for a delay.Mr Bercow compared refusing to ask for a delay in “what one might regard as the noble end” of Brexit to a bank robber insisting they would give their loot to charity.If the Government comes close to disobeying the Act, the Speaker said Parliament “would want to cut off such a possibility and do so forcefully”.“If that demands additional procedural creativity in order to come to pass, it is a racing certainty that this will happen, and that neither the limitations of the existing rule book nor the ticking of the clock will stop it doing so,” he added.We will see in the coming weeksthe British are able to make concrete proposals in writing that are legally operationalMichel BarnierSir Bernard attacked Mr Bercow’s remarks, telling the BBC: “The office of Speaker has become irretrievably politicised and radicalised.“It would have been unthinkable  or  years ago for the Speaker of the House of Commons to launch a personal attack on the Prime Minister like this.”Sir Bernard said MPs should now review the role of Speaker.He said: “For one inidual in what is now a contested, televised, very public and controversial position to have so much unregulated, untrammelled power is something, I think, that the House of Commons is going to have to look at.”Mr Johnson would not have to ask for an extension to January MPs approved a deal or no-deal under the Benn Act, which was pushed through Parliament by opposition MPs and Tory rebels.But Mr Barnier, in a speech to MEPs, suggested that negotiating a new Withdrawal Agreement remained uncertain despite discussions between Mr Johnson’s team and the EU.“I cannot tell you objectively whether contacts with the Government of Mr Johnson will be able to reach an agreement by mid-October,” he said.“While we have previously reached an agreement, as far as we can speak, we have no reason to be optimistic.”The developments came on a day in which the PM “absolutely” denied lying to the Queen to get the suspension of Parliament.Scotland’s highest civil court ruled on Wednesday that the prorogation was unlawful because it was obtained for the “improper purpose of stymying Parliament”.Mr Johnson said the High Court in England had taken the opposite view to the Court of Session in Edinburgh and that the case would now be decided in the Supreme Court.He also insisted he was “very hopeful” that he could secure a deal by the EU summit starting on October .Meanwhile, the full opinions from the judges at the Edinburgh court emerged on Thursday evening.Judge Lord Carloway said the “true reason” for the suspension was to reduce time for “Parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit” in a “clandestine manner”."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":"

The decisions I took contributed to that failure. I failed.”He admitted that he has “many regrets” and that there are “many things” he would do dferently about the vote, but insisted renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU and giving the country a say was the “right approach”.I am truly sorry to have seen the country I love so much suffer uncertainty and ision in the years since then.David Cameron“I did not fully anticipate the strength of feeling that would be unleashed both during the referendum and afterwards, and I am truly sorry to have seen the country I love so much suffer uncertainty and ision in the years since then,” Mr Cameron said.“But on the central question of whether it was right to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and give people the chance to have their say on it, my view remains that this was the right approach to take.“I believe that, particularly with the Eurozone crisis, the organisation was changing before our very eyes, and our already precarious place in it was becoming harder to sustain.“Renegotiating our position was my attempt to address that, and putting the outcome to a public vote was not just fair and not just overdue, but necessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Michael Gove and Boris Johnson In an interview with the paper, he also took aim at Priti Patel’s “attack that wealthy people didn’t understand the problems of immigration”.“It felt very like she was put on point to do some attacking of the government and its record. I suppose some people would say all is fair in love and war and political campaigns.“I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. And they did.”And he revealed that he once texted Mr Gove, now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to say: “You are either a team player or a wanker.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  David Cameron with his we Samantha as he arrived at  Downing Street Mr Cameron also confessed that he got “off his head” on dope while at Eton, and said he smoked it later with his we Samantha and her friends.The former PM – who said he had been “hugely depressed” about leaving Number  – described Mr Johnson as “easy to work with” but admitted that there had been “issues” between the pair.“I want him to succeed. I worked with him well, as I say in the book. I also say that he was a capable mayor. He was easy to work with. I thought he was very talented. I wanted him in my government,” he explained.“We’ve had issues. Even before Brexit, there were sometimes tensions and disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well. And I want him to succeed.“Look, he’s got a very clear strategy and plan. It’s, you know, not the approach that I would have taken, but I want him to succeed.”But on the new Prime Minister’s recent decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks and withdraw the whip from  Tory MPs – including the likes of Ken Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames – Mr Cameron expressed his disapproval.“Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea,” he said.On Friday Mr Johnson said he was not concerned about what his predecessor would write about him in the memoir.“I want people to be clear, absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs in the course of the next few days will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.“Not least for what he did in turning this country round after Labour left it bankrupt.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

Our assessment is that this group is concealing bomb making materials. We have a number of areas of focus but there is nothing definitive and no guarantees. However, our chances of success are vastly improved by support and information from the community.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes.

We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus.

He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town. Ironically, Mark would have been  years old on September  a week after tournament.Former schoolmate, Conor MacNamara, spoke on behalf of the men involved in the fund-raising initiative.   He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to .

that latter section of the A, to open in . Those two schemes cost £ million.They are two of three major improvements on the main route to the Northwest.The third dual carriageway is the longest, a -mile stretch that is being built from Dungiven to Drumahoe, on the outskirts of the Maiden City.When all three parts are open in , almost  of the -mile journey between York Street, Belfast, and Altnagelvin, will be motorway or high quality dual carriageway. The latter road prohibits right turns across the central reserve, akin to a motorway.The upgrades will leave an -mile single carriageway over the Glenshane Pass, but it has lower traffic levels and climbing lanes.Gareth McLaverty, contracts manager at Graham, who built the road with Farrans, said they were “delighted” to finishthe first phase.He said: “It will help to strengthen the links between Belfast and Derry Londonderry and will bring the long-term benefits to road users and the local community of reduced journey times and improved road safety.”The road was delayed by environmental objections. Mr McLaverty said: “We have done our utmost to limit the environmental impact. An acoustic barrier, re-grading of agricultural land to reduce the impact of embankments, sustainable drainage ponds, farm accommodation tracks, over-bridges and underpasses, landscaping planting and boundary treatment are among the work carried out.”Video: Julian Smith issues Magee growth report - Department has not explored University for Derry Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams. I know mum and dad were glad to see me get through it.”\"  \"  Malcolm McKeown Murder: Police release C.C.T.V. footage of car used by gunmanTop teacher warns on mental health time bomb over autism

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
