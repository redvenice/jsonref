This is an improvement on the 210p a share previously offered by Allied Universal, which G4S said significantly undervalued the company.G4S, which operates services including running four British prisons and managing 21 UK Covid-19 test centres, has been heavily criticised following a series of scandals about its work on UK government contracts.Allied Universal said its offer included a significant premium on G4S’s share price at the beginning of the offer period in September.However, the UK firm’s stock has jumped in the last three months since a bidding war intensified between two of its overseas rivals, and its shares closed at 255p on Tuesday.G4S has been fighting off hostile takeover bids from its smaller Canadian suitor GardaWorld for several months. GardaWorld made a final bid of 235p a share earlier this month, valuing G4S at £3.68bn.The directors of Allied Universal and G4S said that the combined company would create a “world-leading integrated security business with revenues of approximately $18bn (£13.5bn), a strong international platform and an extensive portfolio of blue-chip clients across the public and private sectors”.G4S’s chairman, John Connolly, recommended that shareholders vote to accept the offer, which he said “represents an excellent opportunity to create a leading global security company, for shareholders to realise value for their investment at an attractive premium, while also ensuring the future success of G4S for employees, customers and other stakeholders”.Allied Universal said that US regulators had already given the go-ahead for the merger to proceed.G4S employs 533,000 people across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America.The firm has repeatedly hit the headlines after being stripped of several government contracts, including its contract to run HMP Birmingham, but the majority of its work emanates from corporate contracts.G4S runs cash-handling services and provides security operations, including at the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6c6aa5e433e2f47beea3b442bf8c48f927c548/1515_1426_6548_3929/master/6548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d191a51bb4802849d854fd13748d430","title":"ineos boss opts to build british heir to land rover defender in france","story":"Vocal Brexiter Sir Jim Ratcliffe vowed to make new Grenadier 4x4 in Bridgend but has now bought car plant at HambachBillionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has chosen to build a “British” 4x4 inspired by the Land Rover Defender in France, rather than Bridgend in Wales.Ratcliffe, who has built up an estimated £12.15bn fortune from petrochemicals company Ineos, announced on Tuesday that the Ineos Grenadier vehicle will be built at the former Smart factory in Hambach, close to the French-German border. The deal will “safeguard” 1,300 jobs at the factory, but dash hopes for an automotive revival in south Wales.Ratcliffe, a vocal Brexit supporter who recently left the UK for tax-free Monaco, said Hambach had presented the company with “a unique opportunity that we simply could not ignore”.He said that in Hambach, Ineos was buying “a modern automotive manufacturing facility with a world-class workforce”.“Ineos Automotive set out a vision to build the world’s best utilitarian 4x4, and at our new home in Hambach, we will do just that,” he added.Ratcliffe last year announced plans to build a factory in Bridgend and employ 500 British people building the new vehicle. “We have looked long and hard at possible manufacturing locations for Grenadier across the world with lots of good options to choose from,” he said in September 2019. “The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing, which has always been at the heart of what Ineos stands for.”When Ratcliffe announced plans for the Grenadier – which is named after the pub near Buckingham Palace where he first conceived of the idea – the billionaire said: “Our preference is to build it in the UK.“We’d like to retain the Britishness and have a bit of passion about UK manufacturing,” he told Sun readers at the time. “We believe that Britain can produce something as reliable as Germany or Japan if we do it well.”However on Tuesday, Ratcliffe announced that Ineos had bought the Hambach factory from Mercedes-Benz and would start building the 4x4 there in late 2021. “The acquisition secures the future of the site and safeguards many jobs that might otherwise have been lost,” Ineos said.Dirk Heilmann, chief executive of Ineos Automotive, said: “This acquisition marks our biggest milestone yet in the development of the Grenadier. Alongside the exhaustive testing programme that our prototype vehicles are now undergoing, we can now begin preparations at Hambach to build our 4x4 from late next year for delivery to our customers around the globe.”Ratcliffe said he came up with the idea of pumping £500m into creating a successor to the Defender over beers in the Grenadier pub in Belgravia, London.He had already selected German, rather than British, engineers to create the designs for the vehicle.The Ineos chairman and majority shareholder said he wanted to create a “rugged, uncompromising, no frills” spiritual successor to the original Defender because of his love for the vehicle, which is also a favourite of the Queen.“When I’m on safari in Africa I always prefer to be in a Land Rover,” he said. “But I always carry a picnic basket.”Jaguar Land Rover ceased producing the original design of the Land Rover Defender in 2016 after 68 years but launched its own all-new version earlier this year.According the latest Sunday Times rich list, Ratcliffe is worth just over £12bn, making him the fifth richest person in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5886eb4a7756065075ffa8cfb0a082204dcd75a4/0_134_1358_815/master/1358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28672f424b24775e1dcabf8b1dfab757","title":"codpieces zeppelins best brexit","story":"There’s no definitive answer yet as to who messed things up worst – but there are plenty of committed contendersDavid Cameron’s referendum on EU membership was intended to “settle the issue for a generation”. Since then, Britain has been trapped in a midsummer night’s scream that has lasted four and a half years, and has not technically actually even begun. We must hope the way to the sunlit uplands is via shit creek – because that’s certainly the direction we took. Still, as we sit and wait for deal or no deal, let’s take a look at Brexit’s best bits.At one point, Michael Howard threatened war with Spain. On another occasion, a Ukip leader wrote to the Queen to inform her she had committed treason when she signed the Maastricht treaty. A thinktank suggested the Irish border issue could be resolved with zeppelins – the only problem being, they were insanely expensive and entirely weather-dependent. During one of the “meaningful votes” – sorry, no idea – an MP intoned to parliament: “This is a turd of a deal, which has now been taken away and polished, and is now a polished turd. But it might be the best turd that we’ve got.”Preposterous people became a thing. Throbbing forehead vein Mark Francois compared a mild letter from the Airbus CEO with Rommel’s Atlantic wall defences. Steve Baker uttered the words: “Everybody knows I’m Brexit hardman Steve Baker.” Boris Johnson uttered the words “Fuck business.”It was announced that a “major Hollywood studio” was turning Arron Banks’s Bad Boys of Brexit book into a $60m, six-part TV drama, which would have made it one of the most expensive shows then on TV. Kevin Spacey was tipped to play Farage. (Probably worth going back to him now.)Brexit produced hallucinatory TV moments. Theresa May was shown a cowpat at the Chelsea flower show and pronounced it “wonderful”. A batshit Channel 4 News film saw Jacob Rees-Mogg and Alastair Campbell sat in a cafe with a gynaecologist whose German wife had left him for voting leave because he thought it would help the NHS. Or consider this exchange between Will Self and Mark Francois on BBC One. Self: “Well Mark, what’s in your codpiece?” Francois: “That’s none of your business.” Self: “Are you saying that because you’ve got a small penis?” Francois: “As a matter of fact mate, no, quite the opposite.”According to many of its most ardent pushers, Brexit was best understood in terms of the second world war or their own virility. Perhaps the latter was one reason Theresa May was so bad at it. The only way she could have been worse is if she had done what Jeremy Corbyn demanded and triggered article 50 the day after the referendum result.May conducted a general election campaign entirely in safe spaces where she only spoke three words: “strong and stable”. You campaign in poetry, govern in prose – so if that’s the poetry, do just imagine the state of the prose. Indeed, you lived through it, while May continued to act like she had a landslide majority (as did Labour). By the time she was coughing her way through that conference speech at which a ninth-tier comedian gave her a P45, she was excruciatingly unwatchable. Or, as Michael Gove put it: “I witnessed a great speech from a prime minister at the top of her game.”Months, maybe years, were lavished on Tory plotting. Nigel Farage resigned repeatedly. At one point, he said he was on the point of calling for a second referendum. Vince Cable, centrist leader of a remain party, missed a key Brexit vote in order to attend a London dinner party reportedly about the setting up of a new centrist remain party. James Dyson moved his HQ to Singapore.Ukip had a punch up in the European parliament building. The MEP who came off worst was treated in a Strasbourg hospital, with the official party statement on his progress reading: “Steven is sick of croissants and ready for a full English.” Rather than resign, one tweedy Ukip leader barricaded himself into a provincial hotel with his 25-year-old racist girlfriend. His successor appointed Tommy Robinson as an adviser.In Brussels, the theory developed that Britain simply could not be this unprepared – it had to be a ploy. Islington-based blogger Dominic Cummings would unleash 20,000-word drive-bys on what the government was getting wrong. Dominic Raab revealed he “hadn’t quite understood” how reliant the UK was on the Dover-Calais crossing. He was Brexit secretary at the time. Chris Grayling … but no. Still too raw.Judges, newspapers, the BBC, the House of Lords, the civil service – all were blamed for politicians’ failures. David Cameron would emerge occasionally from his £25,000 shepherd’s hut to post pictures of his feet or take £100,000 for a speech.As for who messed Brexit up worst: Tories, Labour, the Lib Dems, even the Brexit party – was ever a contest more closely fought? No one managed anyone’s expectations. Brexit remained a Rorschach blot in which people continued to see what they wanted to see for months and years after they should have known better. Boris Johnson congratulated May effusively on the backstop, while Michael Gove said: “The final whistle blew … and Theresa May has won.”Cut to a couple of months later in the House of Commons, where an MP had referenced an anti-Brexit sticker in John Bercow’s wife’s car, and was shouting at the Speaker: “HAVE YOU DRIVEN THAT CAR WITH THE STICKER THERE?” In unrelated news, it emerged we buy half our sperm from Denmark.The above, of course, barely scratches the surface of the past few years, in which the UK repeatedly tried and failed to take back control of taking back control. Is the beginning finally in sight? Will Boris Johnson ace the statecraft this week, allowing us to move on to the creative phase of all this creative destruction? I know the prime minister likes a quote, so I offer the following observation of the Romanian writer Panait Istrati, when visiting the 1930s USSR of purges and show trials. “All right, I can see the broken eggs.

Here he is, look, talking to Sky News about the doomed track-and-trace system, giggling in front of a faux-punk portrait of the Queen. Here he is, look, threatening Piers Morgan that he’ll take the vaccine on live television. And here he is – and yes, I’ve just watched it back again to make sure – here he is crying on Good Morning Britain, because someone called William Shakespeare took the vaccine, and that man was British. I grew up on a steady diet of Zig and Zag, so I’m fairly used to waking up to watch puppets being controlled by hands inserted into their darker regions, but I do think the 2020 reboot needs to work in the realism department.Are we all right? Matt Hancock, who is pretending to cry on TV by holding a single finger to a dry eye and then laughing – I don’t want to “gatekeep crying” but that is simply not how it is done – clearly isn’t all right. With Tuesday morning’s rollout making household names of Coventry grandmother Margaret Keenan (the first person to take the PfizerBioNTech vaccine outside of trials) and William Shakespeare (the first person named William Shakespeare to take the vaccine out of trials), it’s totally understandable that this news would bring with it a small, squirming feeling of hope. But then Hancock dabs his bone-dry eyes again and says something like, “There’s so much work that’s gone into this and it really, really … I’m just proud to be British”, and: ah. Are you? Really? Why?I suppose it is hardwired into the British condition to react to any hardship big or small by doubling down on dumb patriotism, but I do really think it is worth saying that “Germany developed the vaccine, all we did was buy it” before we plan a too-many-Red-Arrows flyover.There’s an old dunk the British like to perform on Americans about the second world war – “You took your time getting involved!”, men born in 1965 like to joke with men born in 1978, in bars and pubs across the free world – and it relates to some complex neuroses about valour, sacrifice and having had comparatively easy lives: I don’t know. Britain being the first country to roll out a Covid vaccine feels less of a gritty victory won in the trenches and on the beaches, and more like camping overnight for three days outside an Apple store to be the first to buy an iPhone: like yeah, you did it, but it’s very difficult to respect you for it.Big week for patriotism though, isn’t it? Kate and William – who, if you haven’t got up to that bit in The Crown yet, are the good honest millennial-era royals we like, and not the workshy millennial-era ex-royals we hate – are doing a tour of Scotland and Wales, for some reason, but on a train this time, so it’s fun. Part of me was hoping they’d see the reality of British train travel and revolutionise it from the inside – Prince William, so affected by being shimmied out of his chair by two people with five people’s luggage who insist that they’ve booked his table, then sitting on a fold-down seat by the toilets and having his £9 cheese toastie interrupted by people who need a crap repeatedly asking him, “Is there anyone in there, mate?”, like what am I, the Toilet Master? – but then I found out they’re travelling via royal train.So at no point in their tour will they have to confront the strange sewage-y smell of every single carpet on certain expensive train operators. Prince William will never have to idle for half an hour at Rhyl. At no point will Kate have to fumble through her bags to produce a millennial railcard which – both she and the inspector know full well – expired several years ago. This was an opportunity lost.Still, you have to wonder what those encountering the royals in Vaccine Week are feeling. Existential apathy, I’m suspecting. On a week where the long-awaited vaccine is finally rolling out but things are still extremely bad, pandemic-wise, Kate and William are doing a frontline worker-thanking tour but not actually taking the vaccine with them, so it’s just two royals turning up, slightly flouting domestic Covid regulations, to politely say: hallo.“Just you?” paramedics would be forgiven for thinking, as a flurry of photographers stop them working in the middle of the day to make them line up and keep their distance from two strangers. “No … no vaccine for us or anything?”There’s just – sorry, I’m tearing up. There’s just so much work that’s gone into this pointless train tour of the UK, you know? And it really, really … I’m just proud to be British.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f600dd8708b3656cdd72f5140b2be81df6a8bf/0_172_4734_2840/master/4734.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=cb4f794ff935bcfa7639e0362aa23113","title":"wollstonecraft woolf statues represent women britain black","story":"Both were born into privilege and steeped in empire. Britain’s outstanding black women deserve to be honoured tooThe prospect of a lifesize statue of Virginia Woolf in the capital is moving closer, with a fundraising event this week that campaigners hope will help reach their £50,000 target.It makes perfect sense that Virginia Woolf should be honoured: she was perhaps the best known of the modernist writers in the early part of the 20th century, an innovator of stream-of-consciousness writing. She is recognised for her classic novels including Mrs Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, and brilliant feminist essays such as A Room of One’s Own and Three Guineas.In fact, the campaign to have her recognised was aided by the backlash against another female statue – one honouring the writer, philosopher and founding mother of western feminism, Mary Wollstonecraft. Unveiled last month, the statue controversially portrayed a naked woman with a buff gym-body and abundant pubic hair. The fact it took over 200 years for Wollstonecraft’s life to be commemorated only added to the sense of outrage.Women have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to statues – a 2018 study found they were represented by only 174 statues of 828 surveyed in Britain. Yet, for me, many assumptions around gender need updating too.Today these feminist icons are seen to deserve lasting recognition not only because of their achievements, but because they are somehow one of “us”. The artist behind the Wollstonecraft statue, Maggi Hambling, describes the figure as an “everywoman”. Woolf campaigner Cheryl Robson suggests her bronze form, near Richmond Bridge on a terrace overlooking the Thames, will provide girls and women with a role model. The sculpture includes a bench so that members of the public can engage in conversation with the author – a lovely idea, though deeply ironic considering Woolf was a notorious snob.Yet do Woolf and Wollstonecraft really represent all women? Both were born into wealthy families and their writing is steeped in the language and ideology of the British empire. Woolf herself had the freedom to write largely thanks to money inherited through her family’s colonial activities. And in her most famous essay about women and writing, A Room of One’s Own, she disparages a silent and very alien “negress” who apparently does not count as a woman.Wollstonecraft herself built an argument on the value of women as intelligent and deserving of education by comparing them over and over to objectified slaves – 80 times, no less, in her landmark text A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published in 1792. And as writer and professor Moira Ferguson makes clear in her book Subject to Others, Wollstonecraft pushed for political enfranchisement for white women while dehumanising black women and men.These feminist writers might be a long way from the likes of white supremacists Cecil Rhodes and Edward Colston, whose statues were targeted by anti-racism campaigners. Still, the representation of these two feminist figures as down-to-earth is well wide of the mark.Evidence that Wollstencraft, Woolf and many other feminists of the past spared little if any thought to advocating for women of colour should not be swept under the carpet. Do modern-day feminists really want to imitate those in power who have long omitted “unhelpful” passages of history?Britain’s lack of statues of women is bad enough, but it is pitiful too that only two represent black women: one for Crimean war nurse Mary Seacole the other for Olympian Kelly Holmes.Hopefully we’ll see statues in the future representing a broader range of women. After all, Britain’s outstanding women have not all been white and posh. Surely deserving is Mary Prince, the first woman to present an anti-slavery petition to parliament, and the first black woman to write and publish an autobiography, in 1831. A petition is currently under way to install a statue of her outside the Museum of London Docklands.Another contender must be Phillis Wheatley, who in 1773 became the first female writer of African heritage to be published in the English language. A plaque commemorating her achievement was installed outside London’s Dorsett City hotel last year. And let’s not forget women who may not have written works of literature or led battles or joined parliament. For example, the British Jamaican-born pre-Raphaelite model Fanny Eaton, whose presence supported the development of artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the 19th century. Eaton has been left out of history, unlike contemporaries such as Elizabeth Siddal and Jane Morris. Eaton raised 10 children and worked a series of jobs as a seamstress, a cook and cleaner. Her relatives are battling to have a plaque in her name.Statues invite us to ask questions about who should be valued and why. Imagine the difference it would make if, rather than the stiff privileged men on plinths, we could see statues of amazing women from different backgrounds who contributed to society leading campaigns, or writing songs, or fostering children, perhaps? It would surely send an inspirational, and inclusive, message to all of us.• Claire Hynes teaches literature and creative writing at the University of East Anglia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adf1604f3d2e5a97b53bb7a21854588dda7a386/0_0_3067_1850/master/3067.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a495f0d33f255b6fdf954c11f667506","title":"how darjeeling express and dishoom put a fresh spin on tradition to shift the tastes of modern britain","story":"The founders of two of the UK’s most pioneering Indian restaurants changed the nation’s perception of the cuisine by drawing on the old waysThe first Indian restaurant in Britain opened more than two centuries ago – almost as long ago, in fact, as the earliest Scotch whisky distilleries – so it’s no surprise that curry is so firmly embedded in the nation’s psyche. But the days of the homogenous chicken tikka masala or korma are firmly in the past, as a new breed of restaurateurs have spiced up the nation’s palate with their original thinking and modern perspectives on Indian cuisine. And despite a tumultuous year for the restaurant industry, this culinary revolution shows no signs of abating.Think of game-changing Indian restaurants in Britain and a leading contender has to be Dishoom. Inspired by, and putting a fresh twist on, the Irani cafes of Mumbai, it sparked a wave of new restaurants, all bent on pushing boundaries and unearthing the richly-varied culinary lore of India.“Before Dishoom, certainly in London, there was a sense of Indian food just being about curries,” says its co-founder Shamil Thakrar. “Dishoom allowed for more regionally-focused Indian cuisine, and for people to mess around with small plates and cocktails. When others saw we were successful, they thought: ‘We could do something like that.’ There are some fantastic restaurants that have come up subsequently, like Gymkhana or Gunpowder.”For housewife-turned-chef Asma Khan, the notion of refining tradition has taken the form of unwinding the templated feel of the typical high-street curry house, and going back to the roots of Indian cooking – an authentic labour of love, served with the warmth of the home. Darjeeling Express began life in 2012 as a supper club, as Khan experimented with the old family recipes she’d grown up eating in Kolkata. Within five years, she had opened her restaurant to such acclaim that, before long, she had appeared in her own episode of Netflix’s Chef’s Table (the first British chef to do so).At Darjeeling Express, in central London, slow-cooked dishes such as lamb dum biryani and fish malaikari are designed to be shared, while the chef looks on, a warm presence in the dining room rather than staying hidden in the kitchen. “I see the people come in and, like a grandmother, I watch while they eat,” says Khan. “I want people to relive that moment of knowing that someone loves you enough to cook for you. It is the reason for cooking – it should not be to impress.”If Darjeeling Express makes diners feel right at home, then Dishoom, which now has eight restaurants across London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, is like the friendly cafe down the road whose door is always open. It’s charming, immersive and stylish thanks to mid-20th century Irani cafe design details such as marble tables, ceiling fans and family portraits. Dishoom’s signature staples such as vada pav and black dal, not to mention the legendary bacon naan breakfast rolls, ensure customers return again and again, often queuing round the block for a table.“The idea of cafes doesn’t feel very Indian, so it was lovely to change the way people thought about urban India and its food,” says Thakrar. “Irani cafes were some of the early spaces in India that brought together different walks of life – the taxi driver, the barrister, the artist – in one place to eat. I remember when we opened in Shoreditch, there were hipsters in their skinny jeans and big glasses standing in the queue next to old Indian aunties.”Having non-culinary backgrounds seems to have enabled both restaurateurs to envision new takes on the norm. Thakrar worked as a corporate strategist and then as a director at his family-owned business before co-founding Dishoom Khan, meanwhile, did a PhD in British Constitutional Law before eventually deciding to pursue “the dream of cooking for others”.“I don’t cook the way people think Indian people cook, I don’t measure,” says Khan, who taught herself using her mother’s recipes when she was homesick after her move to Cambridge from India in the early 1990s. “Cooking is about tasting and layering and balancing. There’s a whole journey of different flavours. Even though it’s spicy, the chilli should not dominate – and if it does, you’re a bad cook!”Innovation is not only to be found on the plate, of course. A point of pride at Darjeeling Express is its all-female kitchen, where the average age is 50. Khan likes to employ people from an immigrant background who don’t have professional culinary skills, because they remind her of herself.While Thakrar might not be as hands on in the kitchen at Dishoom – where executive chef Naved Nasir reigns – the skills he brings to the table are just as essential for the brand to remain ahead of the game.Thakrar is an inveterate storyteller, even creating a fresh narrative theme that closely informs the concept and design of each new branch of Dishoom. He imagines who might have launched the cafe, and who its patrons might have been, had it opened in Mumbai – which Thakrar, evoking its more freewheeling older days, refers to it by its former name.“It takes you to a different time and place and offers you a sense of immersion,” he says. “I love the idea that you can take these stories and make them whimsical and beautiful, and teach someone a bit of history, and then finally you get to taste this delicious food. For people who know Bombay, it is transporting, and for everyone else it’s putting the food and drink in the right cultural context.”The restaurant industry, like so many others, is facing up to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, and both Thakrar and Khan have had to innovate and adapt. Dishoom now offers a delivery service and – taking advantage of the popularity of its breakfasts – an at-home bacon naan kit. Darjeeling Express has launched a takeaway deli menu even while going ahead with plans to open a new, larger site in Covent Garden in December.As a year like no other continues to redefine the once gloriously-normal pleasure of dining out and exploring the nuances of global cuisines, restaurateurs such as Khan and Thakrar continue to pave the way – shifting perceptions and pushing boundaries even as they honour traditions.Original by TraditionThe Glenlivet is the original Speyside Single Malt and has been breaking traditions to set new standards in whisky since 1824.

Our experts share the drinks they’ll be serving up as the nights draw inThe golden hue of autumn leaves, the scent of woodsmoke and bonfires … there’s no spirit that better captures the feeling of autumn than a single malt. But single malts have, for unfathomable reasons, long been the purview of the connoisseur. What better season to usher in the realisation that they can also star in some truly tasty cocktails that are perfect for the weeks ahead?Here’s an array of five moreish cocktails to see you through the long autumn nights. The classically floral and fruity flavours of Speyside-style whisky are at the forefront, yet enhanced by the fresh new twist of deliciously innovative ingredients.The rusty hues of an Old Fashioned look like autumn in a glass. Bobby Hiddleston, bartender and co-founder of Swift Bar in Soho, London, adds a further seasonal twist to this absolute classic by swapping out the slightly summery citrus of orange for the earthy October flavours of plum and pear.How to make itMix in a glass 50ml The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 25ml umeshu, 10ml crème de poire and add two dashes of lemon bitters for the tart kick of a classic old fashioned. Add a big cube of ice and garnish with a twist of lemon peel.Espresso Martinis are so last season. Instead, try a warming batch of Spiced Speyside Coffee, the ultimate whisky cocktail when you have friends over. This one’s made for long nights chatting by the fire, or a delicious pick-me-up as group energy levels start to waiver.“The character of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old stands up to the flavour of the coffee, while the hint of cayenne pepper complements the spice of the single malt,” says The Glenlivet’s head of heritage and education Alex Robertson.How to make itFor intimate autumnal gatherings, whip up a batch for four. Take 160ml of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 60ml coffee syrup, 40ml sugar syrup, 300ml americano coffee, and ½ tsp cayenne pepper. Mix together in a warmed glass jug. Pour into four long-stemmed glasses, and top with lightly whipped double cream, drained over a spoon into each glass to form a layer on top. Garnish with chocolate flakes and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.As the rays of a low sun stream through the trees, crack out the blender for a cocktail that blends the last throes of summer with the chilly days of autumn. Dubbed The Glenlivet Colada by whisky writer Felipe Schrieberg, the pineapple juice works nicely with the flavour profile of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve – which is selectively finished in Caribbean rum barrels – and whispers a faint memory of warmer days, while the warm hit of cinnamon brings in the smoky-sweet hint of autumn.“Pina coladas are my (not very) guilty pleasure, any season, and using a gentle, sweeter whisky like The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve serves as a perfectly lovely substitute for rum,” says Schrieberg, who is currently running virtual whisky masterclasses all autumn over Zoom.How to make it Add 50ml of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve to 120ml pineapple juice, 60ml coconut cream, a dash of bitters, and a splash of cinnamon syrup. Pulse together in a blender with crushed ice. Garnish with pineapple leaves and a stick of cinnamon.As the nights draw in, cuddle up on the sofa with a calming nightcap. The Glenlivet’s Small Voice of Calm cocktail is a soothing mix of chamomile, whisky and lemon: the perfect tonic after a long day of video calls and endless emails.“The floral notes in The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve are brought out by the chamomile, while the sharp lemon notes complement the sweetness of the whisky,” says Robertson.How to make itPour 50ml The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 25ml chamomile syrup, and 10ml lemon juice into a cocktail shaker and lightly shake to mix the ingredients. Strain over cubed ice in a short glass and top up with 100ml chilled soda water. Garnish with chamomile flowers or a wedge of lemon.As the cold weather draws in, the temptation is to stay indoors. Stick the kettle on and rustle up some company – a luxurious Hot Toddy. Served in an enamel mug, it’s like a tiny hot-water bottle for your hands and warms your insides. This is a favourite of whisky writer and Instagrammer The Whisky Lady, AKA Anne-Sophie Bigot.“As the temperatures drop, autumn is all about warming up and being cosy, and for me whisky cocktails are definitely part of the equation. A good scotch hot toddy on the couch, sat by a crackling woodfire is a must. It screams autumn vibes to me,” says Bigot.How to make itBest built in an enamel mug, take 50ml of The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, add 15ml lemon juice and 15ml ginger syrup for a spicy kick. Swirl together with a couple of dashes of bitters. Top with hot water and garnish with a slice of lemon studded with cloves for that sweet, peppery aroma that whispers of frosty nights.The Glenlivet is the original Speyside single malt, setting new standards since 1824.

Pran Patel, a former assistant headteacher who provides anti-racism and unconscious bias training to UK schools, says: “White privilege is straightforward: white people don’t deal with racialised systemic discrimination. That’s the reality of the society we live in.“The consequences of white privilege are there to see: the pay gap for black and minority ethnic people, the fact black people are 40 times more likely to be stopped and searched and more likely to be sectioned. Saying we need to be really balanced about that, I find problematic.”This year, following the death of George Floyd in America and Black Lives Matter protests across the globe, many UK headteachers, who had slumbered on the issue of racism, have been sharply awoken, while their students confidence to speak out has been boosted by high-profile support and petitions for more representative curriculums.However, just as schools were implementing new anti-bullying policies and curriculums to include black perspectives, in October the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, warned that teaching about white privilege “as fact” without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views would be breaking the law.Invoking the 1996 Education Act, which forbids the promotion of partisan political views, Badenoch, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, said schools that “openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group” were in contravention of their “statutory duty to be politically impartial”.What does this mean for teachers? If a GCSE student comes across the work of Richard Delgado or Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, scholars in critical race theory, should a teacher steer clear of their questions? After all, Badenoch said, “this government stands unequivocally against critical race theory”. Or if a year 6 student finds something about white privilege on Instagram, should teachers be explaining it as a reality – or as a “contested political idea”, in Badenoch’s words?Rabiger says: “The minister’s remarks could have a silencing effect. The risk of what she has said is a bit like section 28 and gay rights, where you’re not allowed to be seen to be ‘promoting’ a particular view. This is scaring people away from the trickier questions. I would have no problem teaching about white privilege. As long as you’re teaching about the social factors and being balanced, that’s not against the law.”Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, brought in by Margaret Thatcher’s government, banned the “promotion” of homosexuality and “acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. This had a chilling effect on teachers. Critics said the legislation “cast a cloud of confusion and ambiguity” and many schools opted simply never to discuss homosexuality. It was repealed in 2003.Teachers do need to be equipped for the toughest questions, says Rob Carpenter, chief executive at the Inspire Partnership, an academy trust with nine primary schools across south London and Kent. He and his team decided to “frame our leadership meetings around different books, like Hashi Mohamed’s People Like Us, or Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge.“We take a chapter and that then turns into a discussion about ‘what does that mean for us?’” he says. The idea is for staff to engage in some of the trickiest conversations among themselves first, so they feel more prepared heading into the classroom. These texts tackle issues such as white privilege. But what about teaching it to kids?“We wouldn’t explicitly teach about white privilege in a non-contextual way, but we would approach the theme of social justice and equity within the context of a historical period,” Carpenter says.In June, 12 days after the death of George Floyd, Omie Elizabeth Dale published an open letter to Stanground academy, in the largely white city of Peterborough, about her schooldays there. Dale, who left the school in 2013 and now works in public relations, says: “My letter mainly came from a place of thinking there will be students who may be experiencing the same stuff I had. I had a largely positive experience. It wasn’t really until I left that I was struck by my experience and what was tolerated there.”Wayne Norrie, chief executive, since 2016, of Greenwood academies trust, which runs Stanground academy among its 37 schools, invited her to speak to him and she is now the trust’s adviser on racism and has been asked to join the board. Dale said she was persuaded to get involved because Norrie “does have a real wish to improve the lives of his pupils in every possible way”.Norrie says Dale “explained to me what it was like to be black, walking into a white environment, and how that made her feel”. But he is cautious about quick-fix solutions. “What I fear is tokenism,” he says, “people rushing in and getting it wrong”. The trust is putting together a three-year plan, beginning with surveys to families this term.Some people in education back the equalities minister’s view that white privilege is a contested idea. Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, an English teacher and member of campaign group Don’t Divide Us, says: “I’m very much in favour of schools being places of intellectual inquiry, but what I am not in favour of is telling children they personally are racists or at risk of being racists or are personally oppressed.” She says her group has been contacted by teachers concerned by their school’s approach to Black History Month, or parents whose children have been asked to list the ways in which they are privileged.Cuthbert suggests a compromise for teaching the topics. “You could have a Black Lives Matter speaker in and a Don’t Divide Us speaker in. As an educator, you want to complicate things, not close them off.”Michael Brotherton, a lawyer in the education team at law firm Stone King, says: “Legally, context is everything and delivery is everything. You could have two lessons on white privilege, and one could be balanced and thought-provoking, and the other could be a monologue.” Where schools may run into trouble is proving the lesson was balanced. “Written evidence is always the best evidence. But the lesson plan would only get you so far, because obviously you could have said anything.” He concedes: “There is a risk teachers might run scared.”In her letter about her old school, Dale reserved her strongest warnings for teachers who failed to respond to her questions or proactively tackle racist behaviour. Her little brother is now at Stanground academy. She will be trying to make sure that his questions will be answered clearly by staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a44cb6b5d81410a9fe582a7209516b93ed232a5b/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=38a6ac46a2da03f250d67afea12435b8","title":"earth photo 2020 nature photography winners in pictures","story":"Earth Photo, the international competition and exhibition created by Forestry England and the Royal Geographical Society with IBG, aims to encourage discussion about the environment by telling stories about the natural world, its inhabitants and our treatment of both"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/244f27bfe05e5b2ec085fa93330ebdd404f77aa8/0_284_2646_1587/master/2646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35d5df61b335a2ec4f6fbedf067ebd6","title":"psg v istanbul basaksehir suspended after fourth official accused of racism","story":"Uefa has announced it has launched a “thorough investigation” after players from Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir left the pitch in the 23rd minute of their Champions League fixture in the French capital on Tuesday night following an incident of alleged racism by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu.Play was immediately suspended and while an attempt was made to restart the game with a new fourth official it was ultimately abandoned after the visiting side refused to return to the pitch. Instead the remaining minutes of the match will resume from 5.55pm GMT on Wednesday.“Following an alleged incident involving the fourth official, the match was temporarily suspended,” read a Uefa statement. “After consultation with both teams, it was agreed that the match would restart with a different fourth official. Uefa will thoroughly investigate the matter and further communication will be made in due course.”The walk-off occurred after Basaksehir’s Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo was shown a red card in the 16th minute for protesting against a refereeing decision. That led to the Basaksehir striker Demba Ba, a substitute on the night, confronting Coltescu over what the official said as he called on referee Ovidiu Hategan to dismiss Webo, which Reuters reported as being: “The black one over there. Go and check who he is. The black one over there, it’s not possible to act like that.”In response, a clearly incensed Ba could be seen in video footage saying to Coltescu: “You never say ‘this white guy’, you say: ‘These guys’. So, listen to me, why when you mention a black guy do you have to say ‘this black guy’?”Ba could also then be seen in footage confronting Hategan, and saying to him: “Why he say negro?” There followed heated discussions before both sets of players departed down the tunnel.Issuing a statement on Twitter, Basaksehir said:“Our players have taken a decision NOT TO go back on the pitch after our Assistant Coach Pierre Webo has been exposed to racist behaviour by the 4th Official.” The same account also posted the message: “NO TO RACISM Respect.”PSG also issued a statement on Twitter in regards to what took place during the first half at the Parc des Princes. It read: “After a red card is given by the referee to a member of opposition staff, discussions continue between players and staff of both teams with the referee. The Basaksehir players decide to go back to the locker room, the Parisians follow them.”The show of support from PSG players was swift and decisive. The central defender Presnel Kimpembe could be seen in footage saying: “Is he serious? We are heading in. We’re heading in. That’s it, we’re heading in,” as tensions rose in Paris. Meanwhile, the striker Kylian Mbappé later posted the following message on Twitter: “SAY NO TO RACISM. M WEBO WE ARE WITH YOU”.Players walking off the pitch in protest against racism is rare and the fact those from both sets of teams involved in the game in Paris did so was especially striking. It could also prove a turning point in football’s fight against discrimination, and in that regard there will be much focus on Uefa’s investigation and the sanctions the governing body issues should Coltescu be found guilty of racism.Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, issued his own statement on Twitter on Tuesday night: “We are unconditionally against racism and discrimination in sports and in all areas of life.”Regardless of the result in the rearranged game in Paris on Wednesday evening, Thomas Tuchel’s side have qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League following Manchester United’s 3-2 defeat against RB Leipzig.PSG have nine points, the same amount as United, and even if they remain on that after what will be their final Group H fixture the French champions will progress on the back of having a better head-to-head record against Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side.A victory against Basaksehir would enable PSG to leapfrog Leipzig and progress to the last 16 as group winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fcc3740423b7a57a63e2201fea08e2143b244f4/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=c0791211f0e041acd21ca92600d5a8de","title":"teaching dogs to talk stella bunny","story":"Provided with a board full of buttons, some pets appear to be communicating with their humans – and researchers are investigatingThere are plenty of reasons why we talk to our pets. Some research suggests our chattiness can be motivated by loneliness, a need to feel control over the dynamic of our relationship with them, or even just our perception of animal consciousness. It’s likely that most pet owners would simply feel weird not greeting their wagging pup at the door with a shower of “oh, hellooo”s or cooing baby-talk to their purring cat.What’s altogether unexpected is the idea that pets might talk to us – but new research is exploring whether and how they can.Helmed by Dr Federico Rossano, director of the Comparative Cognition Lab at the University of California San Diego, and Leo Trottier, a PhD candidate, project They Can Talk is one of the latest in a decades-long series of psycholinguistic studies seeking to document non-humans expressing themselves in language-like ways. But unlike many studies of the past, which either focused on the learning capacity of a single star animal – like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi the chimpanzee, or Rico the dog – They Can Talk is an unusually large, open-source citizen science study.More than 1,000 dogs, 50 cats and a few horses are involved in the project – with more applicants every day.Yet there would be no They Can Talk at all if there was not first the work of Christina Hunger, a San Diego speech-language pathologist who began training Stella, her Catahoulablue heeler mix, as a puppy in 2018.Inspired by the behavioral similarities she perceived between Stella and preverbal toddlers, she ordered a box of four recordable buttons and started off with a few of them each programmed to say a different word. “My initial intention was just to teach her a few words to express some basic needs to help us communicate a bit better, but we just kept progressing,” Hunger says.Today, Stella can use her expanded button set-up – itself a kind of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device not unlike those used by humans with language problems – to seemingly convey concepts with combinations of up to five words at a time.When Trottier came across Hunger and Stella on Instagram in 2019, he had already spent years studying cognitive science and developing tech to monitor animal behavior. He quickly realized he could make a prefab pet AAC soundboard anyone could use, and that gaining systematic insight into whether and how animals use language-like communication could be easier than scientists had previously gauged.“I saw Christina doing what she was doing with buttons, and it became clear what we thought would take reams and reams of data and probably a decade or more, as well as a large team of software developers, could actually be done in a fraction of the time with people who are familiar with techniques of speech-language pathology and a bunch of talk buttons that make sounds,” he says.Trottier and Rossano launched the They Can Talk pilot program in March of this year. The researchers found an initial group of 50 – “a lot of teachers, a lot of speech-language pathologists, a lot of dog trainers”, says Trottier – willing to kickstart the project from home by recording their dogs’ interactions with a soundboard of programmable AAC “HexTiles” Trottier designed and now sells through his company, CleverPet. (Hunger, who will release a book of her own work next spring, did not join.)Two of these pilot participants were Tacoma’s Alexis Devine and her sheepadoodle, Bunny. Bunny, who has been using some form of recordable buttons to express herself since Devine brought her home in 2019, is now a bit of an internet celebrity.Since Devine began posting Bunny’s adventures in communication on TikTok in May, her account @What_About_Bunny has amassed 5.3 million followers who love watching Bunny seemingly request afternoon walks by pressing “now”, “afternoon”, or “walk”, or observe the audible ocean waves outside her house by pawing the buttons “water” and “sound”.Bunny’s TikTok popularity supercharged public interest in project They Can Talk, sending heaps of eager new applicants – many of them bored at home during the pandemic and spending loads of time with their pets anyway.By engaging with concepts of time and space, Bunny is also a good representative of what researchers hope to see: pets who are able to go beyond first-order associations, demanding, for example, food or attention, and who rather suggest the capacity for things like syntax and conceptual contextualization. The reason it’s important that Bunny, or any other pet, may be able to refer to things that happened last week is that it counters “the long philosophical and psychological tradition which claims that only humans have certain cognitive abilities that are related to language”, such as episodic memory, explains Rossano.Additionally, Rossano notes that scientists currently believe humans are the only species to use language to convey our emotional experiences to others. By pointing out things that interest her, such as the waves, Bunny seems to be acting much like a human toddler, sharing something that has caught her attention.If animals can truly and reliably use language to place themselves in time and share their emotions, “then already it changes our representation of the emotional, mental life of other creatures, which can of course affect our very assumptions of these animals and how we treat them, how we interact with them, and what kinds of rights we give them”, says Rossano.Critics of the project have noted the issue of confirmation bias: we, as enthusiastically anthropomorphizing humans, long to read into animal behavior and see an intellectual complexity comparable to our own. Perhaps that’s all that is going on when we watch a dog like Bunny.Rossano emphasizes that no dog or other animal should be forced or coerced with food to engage with AAC soundboards. Domestic animals, he notes, have their own fundamental way of relating to humans and each other, and project They Can Talk neither can nor should replace that.“What I’m hoping is, at the very least, participants will get to spend more time with their animal and interact with them, and that itself should be a good thing,” says Rossano. “If the animal doesn’t learn to use the buttons, it doesn’t matter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f0723f0d1f96060bb42c87289c372820163e1c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a361c76217b3a0d438438c3700feb355","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

Normally it’s Matt Hancock who gets all the crap gigs and is No 10’s “designated fall-guy”. But while all Boris Johnson got from his hospital visit to observe one of the first vaccinations – soon every jabbee will be issued with an “I don’t want to be used as a photo op for politicians” sticker – was a whole load of questions on the Brexit negotiations that he couldn’t deal with, Hancock was allowed to bask in his moment of glory. A saviour had risen from the streets and to everyone’s surprise – not least Matt’s – that person was him. Even if it was only for one day.Hancock’s day had begun with a puzzle. Had he or had he not cried on ITV’s Good Morning Britain when watching footage of William Shakespeare of the Stratford-on-Avon area (really) receive his coronavirus jab? Matt certainly appeared tearful, but not everyone was completely convinced. Still, it made good telly.He had said how emotional it was, had lowered his face as he rubbed his eyes and yet it was hard to spot a genuine tear. Perhaps it was just old fashioned British reserve or maybe all his tears had been used up on the 60,000 people who had already died from coronavirus – many of them in care homes as a direct result of his department’s neglect. “It makes me proud to be British,” he said, his voice catching a little, as he conveniently forgot that the vaccine had been made by a German biotech firm working in collaboration with a US pharmaceutical giant.Certainly by the time the health secretary arrived in the Commons at lunchtime to answer an urgent question on the vaccine’s distribution, he appeared to have recovered his composure. This was to be his moment and he was determined to enjoy every second. So often he has been called on to explain why the government’s response to the coronavirus has been at best hopeless and at worst reckless, but now he was just happy to be festooned with garlands from both sides of the house. This year has been unremittingly grim and MPs from all parties were just glad to have some good news to share with one another. Many seemed rather more emotional than Hancock had on telly earlier in the day.Matt didn’t actually have much to say, beyond repeating what he had said on his broadcast rounds. It was a historic day but we should not get too carried away as the NHS faced a herculean task in introducing the vaccination programme across the country. So far the vaccines were restricted to 70 hub hospitals but he expected other hospitals and care homes to receive supplies by next week. But we were still in for a long haul and if we were to get through it then people should abide by the rules. For some reason, he omitted to say that one way of helping might be to scrap the five-day Christmas free-for-all which was sure to add to the death toll in January and February.By and large – the major screw-ups excepted – the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has tried to adopt an approach of constructive criticism in his responses to Hancock’s coronavirus statements. Today he just went for the full love-in. This was a great day and he wasn’t going to spoil it with any niggle. So all he wanted to know was whether all care homes would get the vaccine by Christmas – spoiler alert: they probably won’t as we don’t have enough stock and can’t be certain when the next batches will arrive – and whether junior NHS staff would qualify as priority recipients.Hancock successfully managed to answer completely different questions while repeating that it had been an emotional day. Jeremy Hunt, chair of the health select committee, then asked the question that was literally on no one’s mind. Was it now safe for everyone to book their summer holidays? He’d got a great deal on a villa in the Seychelles but he’d like the health secretary to give him the nod before putting down a deposit. Hancock merely said he’d already sorted his own holiday in Cornwall. Or failing that, the Isle of Wight. Anywhere in tier 1 basically.Most of the rest of the questions were just as soft. If not quite so random. Everyone welcomed the vaccine but wanted to know when it was coming to a hospital near their constituencies and, while they had the health secretary’s unided attention, would he consider moving their region down a tier next week in celebration. Matt merely smiled benignly, assured everyone he had the logistics under control and that he would do what he could when the time was right. He even managed to rein back the jingoistic rhetoric of the UK’s place in world history as the first country to administer the vaccine. Though he did mention it twice.There were just a few MPs who dared raise some of the trickier questions. Like why was track and trace still such a disaster when it was going to be key to protecting the nation’s health in the coming months before the rollout was complete. And what were the contingency plans for bringing the vaccine into the country if there were delays at the border caused by Brexit?“We have five contingency plans,” Hancock insisted. Well, could you let us know what they were, asked Labour’s Emma Lewell-Buck. Matt couldn’t. This level of information was top secret and he’d have to kill her if he told her. Which was odd, as Hancock had already told the country what they were during his media round earlier in the day. Lorries, boats, a variety of ports, commercial aircraft and, if all else failed, the RAF. Still, maybe Hancock could be forgiven for this lapse in memory. As he had said on several occasions, it had been an emotional day. Even the losers get lucky sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f56c6b2da80b8cc1d68a5a995946d46f1df43e/0_158_4809_2885/master/4809.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8e89bb2bdf23492b49bd8dedd6baa7a6","title":"dame rachel de souza set to be next childrens commissioner for england","story":"Appointment of founding chief of Inspiration Trust controversial because of Tory party linksAn academy trust leader, so highly valued by Michael Gove that he once said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”, is the government’s choice to become the next children’s commissioner for England.Dame Rachel de Souza, who is the founding chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, is to take over from the current incumbent, Anne Longfield, when her six-year term in office comes to an end next February.The appointment is likely to be regarded as controversial because of her close links with the Conservative party. The Inspiration Trust, which is made up of 14 academies in Norfolk and north Suffolk, was founded by the Conservative peer and former academies minister Lord Agnew.De Souza, who was appointed a dame in the 2014 new year honours list for services to education, is also a firm favourite of Gove. The former Conservative education secretary once told the Eastern Daily Press: “If anyone asked me what my ideal education policy would be, it would be to clone Rachel 23,000 times.”When Sir Michael Wilshaw stepped down from his role as chief inspector of schools and head of Ofsted in 2016, De Souza was touted as a possible contender to replace him though the Times commented she “may be seen as too close to Michael Gove”. In the end the job went to the current incumbent, Amanda Spielman.A steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, De Souza is regarded as a no-excuses traditionalist who shares Gove’s belief in a knowledge-rich curriculum. Even critics acknowledge her success as a headteacher who has improved schools in deprived areas serving disadvantaged children.There have been allegations about advance warning of Ofsted inspections of schools within the trust, but they were found to be unsubstantiated. Concerns were also raised about the number of pupils moving into home education at one of the trust’s schools.One of the issues on which Longfield has campaigned is the practice of schools moving difficult or low-achieving pupils so that they are not included in GCSE results, known as off-rolling. Longfield has made herself a thorn in the side of the government, speaking out on exclusions, unregulated care homes, free school meals and child poverty. She has also held ministers to account over their response to the pandemic and its impact on children.De Souza’s appointment was welcomed by many on social media. However, one critic told the : “Expect a weaker defender and advocate for children than Anne Longfield was.”Responding to the announcement, De Souza said: “Throughout my whole career, I have been a passionate advocate for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and finding ways to support them so they can realise their potential and flourish.“We all know just how difficult Covid-19 has been for families up and down the country, and – subject to the appointment being approved – I would very much like to play my part in helping level up opportunities for children, and ensuring their welfare everywhere, as we come through this difficult time and look towards a more positive future.”Making the announcement, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, thanked Longfield for her service and said: “It is more important than ever before to have experienced and dedicated colleagues working with us in a shared ambition to protect and defend the most vulnerable children.“I look forward to finalising the appointment of Dame Rachel de Souza as the next children’s commissioner, where she will bring her considerable experience of raising outcomes for every child to this essential role.”De Souza will now appear before MPs on the Commons education committee before her appointment is expected to be confirmed by Williamson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184e60077f095917992edd5093354cf504c067e4/0_98_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968527f5b529c6085a66f9e66e9af9e1","title":"covid driven recession likely to push 2m uk families into poverty","story":"Destitution levels in Great Britain are expected to double in the wake of the pandemic with an estimated 2 million families, including a million children, likely to struggle to afford to feed themselves, stay warm, or keep clean as the recession deepens, according to a study.The estimates, carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), described “increasing, intensifying” levels of extreme poverty experienced by some of the country’s poorest households in recent years, and highlight a social security system increasingly failing to protect society’s most vulnerable.Cuts in social security rates over the past decade, together with design flaws in universal credit and disability benefits, as well as the harsh impact of welfare reforms such as benefit caps, were driving sharp rises in extreme poverty even before Covid struck, the study says.Destitution was most salient in areas of the north-east and north-west of England, and parts of inner London. Over one in every 100 households in Blackpool, Kingston upon Hull, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Salford were in extreme poverty.The study defines destitution as inability to afford two or more of shelter, food, heating, lighting, weather-appropriate clothing, or basic toiletries over the past month, or a weekly income after housing costs of or below £70 for a single adult or £145 for a couple with two children.Helen Barnard, director of JRF, said: “Our social security system should act as an anchor to hold us steady when we’re pulled down by powerful currents like job loss, illness or relationship breakdown. But, right now, our system is not doing enough to protect people from destitution.”She added: “It is appalling that so many people are going through this distressing and degrading experience, and we should not tolerate it. No one in our society should be unable to afford to eat or keep clean and sheltered. We can and must do more.”The report will pile the pressure on ministers to commit to maintaining the £20 a week universal credit boost in April – it says it will decide in the new year. But it also highlights long-term concerns over the adequacy of the UK social security system after a decade of austerity and with months of economic recession lying ahead.A government spokesperson said: “Making sure every child gets the best start in life is central to our efforts to level up opportunity across the country, which is why we have raised the living wage for all and boosted welfare support by billions, including £170m to help families stay warm and well-fed over Christmas.”Although it welcomed the government’s pandemic measures, including the temporary £20 a week uplift, the study said these were not enough to prevent some people falling into destitution, and the problem of extreme poverty would accelerate if the benefits top-up was not maintained.The underlying fragility of the welfare system was highlighted by the finding that half of destitute households in 2019 were in receipt of universal credit or had applied for it. The need to repay advance loans taken out to tide them through the five-week delay for a first benefit payment often left people with little to live on, the report said.It was striking how Britain was increasingly reliant on charity food banks as a “core welfare response” to growing poverty destitution, the report said. “It seems unwise to rely on this voluntary effort to ensure that the basic physiological needs of large numbers of UK residents are met.”Migrants, many ineligible for welfare support, were disproportionately likely to be destitute. “That all those present on UK soil during a national (global) health emergency should have access to the basic essentials for survival is the minimum that a rich and human society should undertake to ensure,” the study concluded.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “No child in Britain should be hungry or without essentials. The government must do more to support struggling families who are facing real hardship this winter. They must see sense and scrap the planned cut to universal credit, which will take £20 a week from 6 million families”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e70aedbcf67ec259d504a56c56f5479640417ce/0_48_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=484172c3881bea970f06834898408ead","title":"alix popham interview rugby union dementia special report","story":"The former Wales back-rower was diagnosed with early onset dementia this year aged 40 and is frustrated the game he still loves – despite what it has done to him – has not been made saferAlix Popham calls it D-day. “We were in the middle of bloody lockdown, couldn’t go anywhere, couldn’t see anybody.” So he was at home with his wife, Mel. And the phone rang. “They told us to sit down and then they said: ‘Sorry, it’s not good news.’”At the age of 40, Popham had been diagnosed with early onset dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (“probable” because the diagnosis can be confirmed only by a post-mortem). He was surprised to find he felt relieved “because I wasn’t going mad. It wasn’t all in my head. I wasn’t making things up.” Later he felt anger, too, anger that the game he loves, and had given his life to, had, it seems, led to this.They showed his last Test match on TV during lockdown, Wales against England at Twickenham in 2008, the first match of the famous grand slam. He watched it with Mel and their three kids. He knows he played in it, that Wales won, but not much more. “I’ve got no recollection of being in the game, I can’t remember being on the bus, being in the stadium.”A lot of his career is like that. “My memories of rugby are made-up, from people telling me things or seeing pictures or watching clips.” He can remember stuff from when he was a kid “but lots of my career I just know I played for these clubs at that time, but I can’t remember a lot else about it”.He knows he met Nelson Mandela before a Test against South Africa in 2003, but only because he has a photo of it. He was knocked out cold during the game and only woke up after the match. His neuropsychologist told him his brain must have been so inflamed it was as if “he had the camera but there was no film in it”.Last year, the problems started to seep into his everyday life. Little things at first, stuff he could shrug off. His wife would send him out to buy milk, but when he got to the shop he’d forgotten what she wanted, or she would send him to get cash from her bank account and he would forget her pin. He would find it hard to concentrate when more than one person was talking, couldn’t tune into a conversation if the TV was on in the background. And he found he was becoming unusually snappy and aggressive. He would slam doors when they rowed, once he even tore off the bannister. And then he would feel guilty. “I would think to myself: ‘What the fuck was all that about?’” Often, the next day, he couldn’t remember what the row was about. He felt a lot of anxiety, too, which he wasn’t used to. All of a sudden he was checking his emails over 10 times or more before he pressed send.Mel wanted him to see a doctor. He told her not to worry, that it was just he was feeling stress. Then he had the blackout. He was out on a bike ride, a 25-mile loop he had done countless times. Halfway round, he had no idea where he was. He stopped, sat on the side of the road, called home, and Mel told him to cycle back the way he came. The next day he made an appointment to see his GP. It was the first of many, in the NHS and then in private care. There were MRI scans, DTI scans, meetings with doctors, neurologists and neuropsychologists. Then D-day. And suddenly, it all started to make sense.As ever with the brain, there is much we cannot know for sure. These diagnoses are a deeply unsettling development in players so young. The gathering of what science likes to call “hard data” takes many years and many studies, which is small comfort to those living with any repercussions in the here and now. It was not until 2019 that science established a raised incidence of mortality by neurodegenerative disease among professional footballers of the 20th century. Rugby is likely looking at a stronger association. Most players, we must hope, will be unaffected. The reality is we will start to find out only as they age. And, even then, is any risk simply a function of playing the sport or of other factors?Rugby is 150 years old. Why is this a problem now?If these cases of dementia are symptomatic of a new phenomenon, the key development appears to be when elite rugby players went full-time in the 1990s. Not only did the physical toll of the 80 minutes intensify dramatically, players were subjected to contact training throughout the week. A group of players intend to pursue a legal case against the rugby authorities claiming they were owed a duty of care given emerging evidence of the dangers.Yes. Training is much more sophisticated than in the wild west of the early years of the professional era. Awareness and treatment of head injury has also been transformed in the last decade. Alas, with better preparation of players, the intensity of the 80 minutes on the field has continued to escalate. There is no way of knowing if the net effect of this relative shift in load from the week to the weekend mitigates the risks.What can rugby do?This is probablyhopefully a problem restricted to the elite game, where the attrition rates are so much higher. Certain measures are already in place since the Thompson generation played. Head injury must be managed ever more carefully. Science is on the cusp of developing technologies to detect brain injury more effectively and swiftly, but this could be a double-edged sword if it goes on to reveal a much higher incidence than previously thought. Current attempts to change the nature of the game are likely to prove hopelessly peripheral. There is no easy answer to that.He still has regular appointments with a neuropsychologist and an occupational therapist. They have been helping the family learn how to live the best lives they can. Mel was staying overnight in London one day a week for her work, but one night when she was away he forgot the grill was on and started a fire in the kitchen. So she decided it was best to stay at home. They make sure they are always in the same room when they need to talk. He has a diary of things he needs to do each day, half hour by half hour. And he has given up alcohol and started learning techniques to help him deal with his stress and anxiety. He wonders how different it all might be if he knew then what he knows now. “But in our day it was sniffing salts and shrug it off.”It’s not only the concussions he is worried about, it’s all the blows. His consultant asked him to make a rough count of the tackles, carries and clean-outs he made in every game and training session. “He thinks minimum I’ve had over 100,000 sub-concussions. Minimum. And that’s just my professional career. I started playing when I was four.” One of his neurologists explained it like this: “Every contact causes a little bit of damage to your brain. Look at it like a leaking tap. If it drips once or twice on a piece of mud there’d be no mark, but if it drips for 14 years there would be a lot of damage. And there is a lot of damage showing on my scans.”However despite it all, he still loves rugby. “All my life, every day since I was four, it’s been rugby, rugby, rugby. And there’s so many amazing things that you get from it.” But he’s angry it is not safer, angry there are people playing now who may end up in the same position he is in. He rattles off three changes he believes the authorities could make tomorrow. The first is to provide each player with a mandatory health check every year, including brain scans. The second is to improve insurance provision after retirement. The third is to limit contact training, which the NFL started doing nine years ago. “Why would they think it’s not going to happen in rugby, when the NFL put that in place in 2011?”“How I look at life is this: if somebody is having a kicking on the side of the street I would pull over and try and stop what was going on. And I’m frustrated at the moment with what’s happening, because it feels like the governing bodies are driving past that person being beaten up. Because they know what the problems are, and they can so easily solve so many of them.” There still are going to be concussions, he says, and freak accidents, because it is a contact sport. Like a lot of former players, Popham carries scars from playing it. His upper body is “buggered”, but he always knew that was the risk. “You know you are signing up for that. Same for all the guys I’ve spoken to. We knew our bodies were going to be in bits when we retired. But we had no clue our brains were as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2d8e5410ad2c434dfcf12ddf65937c3acca77f/116_510_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=524553bab6755bed6303b6930a4d4f81","title":"england to fly home on thursday after tour party pair cleared of infection covid cricket","story":"England’s concerns about the failed biosecure bubble in South Africa stem back to the start of the tour when they saw the home players enter the hotel and immediately hold a team barbecue that evening.The Proteas had already seen one player test positive for Covid-19 before their arrival on site on 18 November but there was shock among the tourists, who checked in 24 hours earlier, when they then saw their opponents immediately gather in a large group.Under the agreed protocols, both squads were expected to socially distance before their first-round tests inside the bubble at the Vineyard hotel. England were all clear but when South Africa announced a second positive on 20 November – a player present at the gathering – alarm bells began to ring.This set the tone for a tour during which three T20 internationals were played but the one-day series was called off, with a buildup of collective anxiety among the tourists tipped over the edge when a third South African tested positive last Friday, followed by two hotel staff and two cases in their own camp.England’s two positives were overturned by additional tests and analysis on Tuesday and they will fly home with the team on Thursday. This, plus five players heading to Australia for the Big Bash League, has only added to a feeling among locals they were too hasty in their decision to call off the tour.England insist they did not get the all‑clear on the two players until midday on Tuesday and by this point Ashley Giles, the team director, had already acted on his players’ concerns. Their faith in the setup had evaporated and there was an acceptance that bubble fatigue had also descended.There have been suggestions that the third South African positive case – whose emergence led to the first ODI at Newlands being called off last Friday – was seen walking around the hotel in the lead-up to this, despite sitting out the final T20 match four days earlier because of illness.Manjra has all but ruled out this case being linked to the second positive case 14 days earlier, stating his test results showed a likely five- to seven‑day infection window. The hotel staff – one of whom worked with the England players – were also regularly tested and the zonal system was not broken.England’s system in the summer clearly differed, with players living on site at the grounds, wearing Bluetooth chips to monitor contact with others, eating at separate tables and even facing away from each other in lifts. Hand sanitiser stations were also dotted around the Rose Bowl and Old Trafford.Manjra, who pointed to the recent Indian Premier League having added to the burden for players in both teams, said: “We opted not to go draconian. We tempered what we did for the mental health of players. We decided to do initial testing and then be a bit more liberal in terms of applications of protocols. We have learned the lessons and we will implement them much more strictly for Sri Lanka, Australia and when England come back.“Finger-pointing does not help in any cause. In the end, the cricket community is small and we have to play each other many times over the next few years.”Ben Stokes’s father Ged has died from brain cancer at the age of 65, his former rugby league club, Workington Town, have announced. Stokes, who left the South Africa tour after the T20 series, missed the back end of the English season to spend time with him in New Zealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b5bb10a8a49e4c14897942b493e2b8e6f9b605/76_322_2924_1756/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43ce1b47ce43205eb5eede43af5de0f","title":"rugby union dark news dementia presents sport with reality dared not face","story":"Analysis: there is a clear link between rugby and dementia, and the key event appears to be the leap to professionalism in the 1990sIn other words, this is not a coincidence, and it is rugby’s problem. No amount of smooth-talking from the sport’s authorities, or platitudes about the need for further research, can controvert what is in plain sight. There is a link between rugby and degenerative neurological disorders. At this point, it must also be asserted that this association is probably with professional rugby, but there is likely to be a sliding scale, which could reach down into the ever-more punishing community game too.It seems the key event is the sudden leap to full-time professionalism of elite rugby union in the mid-1990s. A generation of players, now barely at middle age, thus became the first to play an entire career full-time. In so doing, they assumed a toll of physical attrition unlike that of any previous.Close enough to the amateur era and its unreconstructed ways, that period of early professionalism may even prove to have been exceptionally punishing, certainly in terms of the toll of training throughout the week. Clubs and unions are smarter now with their approach to preparation, but the intensity of the 80 minutes on matchday, fuelled by that ever-improving method, has continued to escalate and shows no signs of abating.Within the last decade, rugby has tried to put its house in order regarding concussion. The transformation in the culture surrounding head injury and the “old school” virtue of toughing it out has been swift, even impressive. But perhaps the most alarming possibility of all is that concussion, as defined variously each time experts in the worldwide Concussion in Sport Group meet, which is every four years, is at best only part of the problem.Such a conclusion would raise both codes of rugby into the highest risk category of the world’s major sports. The dramas that have played out in American football over the question of concussion have been watched with disquiet by rugby, but the suspicion the intensity of head collisions in the NFL is of a different order has allayed some of the fears. If the repetitive-blow hypothesis holds true, if the damage is a function of the number of impacts as well as the intensity, rugby suddenly becomes even more dangerous.There is no way of avoiding repetitive blows to the head, and lots of them, in rugby as currently played. Governing bodies can demand as many red cards as they see fit, or even implement actual law changes to lower the height of a legal tackle, but a sport with so many moving parts in a team, all commissioned to crash into each other at high speed, whether at tackle, ruck or set piece, cannot avoid the repetitive shaking of its players’ brains.The recent shift of the paradigm in football regarding headers offers no comfort, either. No one is knocked out by heading a football, but it seems increasingly likely there is a link there too between the bang-bang-bang of head with object and a raised incidence of neurological complications in later life.Rugby is now confronted with how early “later life” can be. For any of professionalism’s first generation to be diagnosed with dementia when barely into their 40s – and not even as old as that for some of the others with symptoms – is an ethical burden of immense weight for a sport to bear.All rugby players accept, as do those who play so many other sports, that there will be repercussions in later life for their bodies. But the progressive loss of their minds, the erosion of who they are, was never part of the bargain and certainly not within a few years of retirement.There is no way of knowing yet. Of course, any burden borne by what we must ardently hope is a small minority of the elite will be offset by the self-evident benefits that team sports confer across all of society, emotionally and culturally every bit as much as physically.But this is an uncomfortable bargain for a sport to strike. What is non-negotiable is the risks of a career in rugby are made clear to those considering one – and this must happen well before science, in its painstakingly meticulous manner, is able to declare definitively how the mechanics of these injuries work, a clear conception of which remains elusive. As long as players know, a sport’s conscience may remain clear.The trouble is, such transparency comes with a weighty burden of its own. To declare these risks is, effectively, to advertise them. The implications for a sport’s image among the wider population are dire. We are put in mind of smoking, an ever-vanishing pastime once embraced without a thought. We are put in mind of boxing.As society becomes cleaner, more health-conscious, more self-improving, so its tastes change. The great dilemma for a collision sport is that the cleaner, healthier and more improved its players become, the more dangerous they are to each other. No one has done any of this on purpose, but rugby’s paradox is no less ruinous for that – to itself or, it now seems certain, to at least some of the brains of its players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f80e5a16e2c8af4d03da08180eefae94b27529b9/0_310_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3e8c746f49d162f3bc24f2f1d0838991","title":"joe biden coronavirus vaccine health team","story":"President-elect warns of challenges amid Covid surge while Trump ignores gravity of crisis at parallel eventJoe Biden vowed on Tuesday to ensure 100m coronavirus vaccinations would be administered to Americans during his first 100 days in the White House – as Donald Trump held a parallel event where he ignored the deepening public health crisis, instead repeating his false claims that he, not Biden, won the November election.The Democratic president-elect on Tuesday introduced his new leadership team covering healthcare and laid out an aggressive plan to defeat the coronavirus pandemic that contrasted sharply with the Trump administration’s efforts.Speaking at an event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Biden formally introduced the team of scientists and doctors he assembled to guide the nation through what they hope will be the final stage of a public health crisis that has killed nearly 284,000 American lives and is one of the worst crises ever to hit the US.Preparing to assume office in the midst of what experts believe could be the pandemic’s darkest hour, Biden outlined his priorities for his first three months in office, including a commitment to distribute “100m shots in the first 100 days”, a plea for all Americans to wear masks during that period to prevent the spread of the virus and a promise to open a “majority of schools”.“Out of our collective pain, we are going to find a collective purpose,” Biden said, striking a somber tone as he acknowledged the toll of the brutal coronavirus surge averaging more than 2,200 deaths per day. “To control the pandemic, to save lives and to heal as a nation.”Leading what Biden dubbed his “core Covid healthcare team” was Xavier Becerra, his nominee for secretary of health and human services. Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, served 12 terms in Congress and is California’s the attorney general. He would be the first Latino to serve as US health secretary.“The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services has never been as vital or as urgent as it is today,” Becerra said via video link from California.Among the other members of the health team is the former surgeon general Vivek Murthy, whom Biden nominated again for the role, and Rochelle Walensky, whom he picked to lead the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, accepted Biden’s invitation to stay on as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a position he has held since 1984, and will serve as Biden’s chief medical adviser.“Like every good doctor, he’ll tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know,” Biden said of Fauci, who has become one of the most prominent and trusted sources of information during the coronavirus epidemic, despite his turbulent relationship with Trump. Biden said he was honored to be the seventh president Fauci would serve.In a pre-recorded video, Fauci said the current public health crisis was “the toughest one we have ever faced as a nation” and warned that the “road ahead will not be easy”.Echoing Fauci, Biden and his nominees were clear-eyed about the challenges that lay ahead. The promise of multiple vaccines has raised hopes, but his team will be judged by its execution of what Biden vowed would be the “most efficient mass vaccination plan in US history”. A coronavirus vaccine by the drugmaker Pfizer is expected to receive approval by the Food and Drug Administration as soon as this week.Still, “developing a vaccine is only one herculean task distributing it is another”, Biden said, acknowledging that it may take longer than expected and would require persuading skeptical Americans to take the vaccine.That, Biden said, risked slowing the process. He implored Congress to pass a coronavirus economic relief package that would help finance the administration of the vaccines. Forestalling aid, Biden warned, could dramatically “slow and stall” the distribution process.Biden vowed a starkly different approach from that of the current occupant of the White House, who has spent his final weeks in office ignoring the crisis, fixated instead on overturning the results of an election he lost with increasingly wild legal challenges.Whereas Trump has long downplayed the threat of the disease and disregarded public health guidelines, Biden, who used his presidential campaign to demonstrate the seriousness of the pandemic, said his team would “spare not a single effort” to defeat the virus and repeated his promise to be guided by science.At a dueling event celebrating Operation Warp Speed, Trump boasted that his administration had procured vaccines much quicker than expected and claimed that even his critics were praising the achievement as “one of the miracles of modern medicine”.Yet the celebratory White House event came as his administration faced new scrutiny after the New York Times reported that the Trump administration declined an opportunity to purchase more doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine this summer. The White House has denied the story, though several news outlets have corroborated the reporting.As the virus continues its uncontrolled spread, Trump has refused to use his remaining time in office – and significant political sway – to urge Americans to take safety precautions such as mask-wearing and social distancing. Biden, meanwhile, has little power to influence public response to the virus until he is inaugurated next month.In his remarks from Delaware, Biden warned that a preliminary review of the Trump administration’s vaccine distribution plan found several shortcomings, and it remained unclear how the administration had planned to get vaccines from the containers into the arms of 330 million Americans. Until then, Biden said the “easiest” and most “patriotic” action Americans could take to protect their families and friends was to wear a mask.“We’re in a very dark winter – things may well get worse before they get better,” Biden said. “It’s daunting. But I promise you, we’ll make progress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c319ce3878359475755bf4df18ecc38a0fb1e1/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f5e89ab8f34804824f48f5b68096aaa","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

That is a rise from 156 cases per 100,000 the week before, with PHE noting the seven-day case rate for London increased over five consecutive days.In some parts of London, which is currently in tier 2, the latest figures show the rate was even higher, reaching 299 per 100,000 population in Barking and Dagenham and 319 in Havering, with a total of 20 of the 32 boroughs exceeding the average figure for England of 149 cases per 100,000.By contrast many areas already in tier 3 have lower rates, including the city of Bristol, where the rate is almost 141 per 100,000 population, and Coventry, where the rate is just over 134.“The latest data shows case rates are on the increase again in most London boroughs, including in the at-risk over 60s,” said Prof Kevin Fenton, the London regional director for Public Health England.“We’ll need to work together to prevent a big surge in cases in London ahead of the festive period so we must all do our bit and limit the spread over the coming days and weeks.”But Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England and author of Blinded by Corona, stressed that urgent action was needed.Experts say the trend in cases chimes with rises in the positivity rate and recent increases hospital admissions in London.Mike Gill, former regional director of public health for the south-east region, said the situation looks “very grim”. “I think it would be quite wrong to imagine that we can relax at Christmas without doing anything extra between now and then,” he told the . A review of coronavirus restrictions across the country is due to be carried out on 16 December.Prof Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of Independent Sage, agreed restrictions could be tightened.But Scally added that with Christmas rapidly approaching, and the government committed to relaxing restrictions for the festivities, the situation could get worse with expectations of a high movement of people, as well as international arrivals, multigenerational mixing and indoor gatherings – all of which can increase transmission.“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the next week or two leaves the government with a really difficult conundrum just days before Christmas,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cbdef575791b22900a4c97a751d8af720d86f5c/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc9040581f5436344c229a2058e1d34","title":"students in the uk share your experiences of rapid testing coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from students or parents on the mass rapid testing schemes taking place in universities before ChristmasSome experts have called for an end to the use of rapid tests in universities, where they have been rolled out to test students before they return home for Christmas.

Photograph: Getty imagesIt is hard to see how public health officials will not seek a third lockdown in January given their extremely gloomy forecasts of recent days.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, both in his letter to Government last week and his comments at the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing on Monday, clearly foresees daily case numbers after Christmas reaching the kind of level that twice previously triggered recommendations for swingeing restrictions.The euphoria surrounding the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is understandable. But for now, and many months to come, restrictions are the only way Government knows to rein in surging case numbers, when other public health measures have failed.In his letter Dr Holohan set out an ominous picture case numbers did not fall far enough after the last lockdown, they are already rising again, and Christmas is approaching with all the potentially risky socialising that entails.As a result Nphet is already revising its modelling forecast upwards. Previously it had forecast up to 1,200 cases a day by mid-January now Dr Holohan is predicting this will be a reality by the second week of the month.That might not seem like a big difference but it is when you are dealing with exponential growth, as seems likely next month.That our figures have already “bottomed out”, as the chief medical officer said, is evident in the ergent trends over 14 days and seven days.Ireland has the lowest 14-day incidence of the virus in Europe, and this rate has dropped 25 per cent over the previous 14 days.In contrast, the measure of trends over the past seven days is up 11 per cent compared to the previous seven days, and Ireland suddenly has the fifth fastest rising seven-day incidence in the EU.The heavy messaging of public health officials against socialising over the coming weeks may dampen festivities somewhat and curb the spread of the virus, but only to a limited extent given the high starting point after Level 5 restrictions. High figuresOur big problem is an amalgam of smaller problems which are not difficult to discern. First, the Border the incidence of the virus in Donegal is 2.5 times the rest of the country, and is rising again more quickly than elsewhere. Louth also has high figures.This is hardly surprising given that Northern Ireland has four times the number of cases as the Republic. The virus continues to spill over from the North, seriously damaging the Republic’s chance of reining it in. We also have a hospital problem. The two counties with the highest incidence at present are Donegal and Kilkenny, where large outbreaks in local hospitals are filling wards and causing deaths.Across the country hospital outbreaks accounted for 46 deaths out of the 140 that occurred last month, more even than the 41 recorded in nursing homes.According to Dr Holohan’s letter, there were 60 hospital clusters last month in 24 locations, involving 1,000 cases. This is why serial testing of healthcare workers is being introduced in January, making Ireland the first country in the world to undertake such a measure. Though why wait until January?The high incidence of cases among over-65s is also a problem, though continuing outbreaks in nursing homes may largely account for this.Both the hospital and nursing home outbreaks are being brought under control, and another positive sign is the continuing low number of cases in schools (a trends seen in the UK and other countries).Even so, as Dr Holohan says, a surge in January is now “more likely than not”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431231.1607463974!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for reform of testing and travel regime to facilitate international flights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA draft copy of the committee’s report, seen by The , also calls for the introduction of relaxed rules for those coming from territories deemed ‘red’ under the EU’s traffic light system. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill An Oireachtas committee report is set to press for significant reform of the testing and travel regime, amid growing concerns over the future of the aviation sector as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.The transport committee will on Wednesday publish a report on the sector and call for a range of reforms, including an enhanced role for antigen – or saliva – testing in facilitating travel.A draft copy of the committee’s report, seen by The , also calls for the introduction of relaxed rules for those coming from territories deemed “red” under the EU’s traffic light system, including the waiving of a requirement to self-isolate when passengers can produce a negative test from their departure country taken three days prior to leaving.It also calls on Government to subsidise the more expensive “gold standard” PCR tests currently used for travel, so that no passenger will have to pay more than €50. The committee found that the level of follow-up checks on the passenger locator form is “totally inadequate”.The draft report also calls for enhanced State supports for the sector, a strategy to increase levels of international travel next year, and urges Government to seek an exemption from State aid rules so it can support airports with emergency funding, as well as the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme for the sector through 2021.AccelerationThe final version of the draft report, which was still subject to changes, will be published on Wednesday. It calls for the acceleration of validation studies on the use of antigen testing, and recommends that Government commit to using the tests at airports where they are validated to meet World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria.It also calls for the inclusion of the aviation industry on the HSE’s antigen working group, and that testing requirements should not be limited to a single type of test. It calls for the introduction of a traffic light system for non-EU countries.The draft also finds that liquidity supports should be given to companies which had strong balance sheets at the outset of the pandemic, and says a State airports authority for Dublin, Shannon and Cork should be re-established.Separately, the State’s Covid vaccine taskforce is set for talks with the data protection watchdog over its plans to track delivery of the immunisation programme across the population. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has previously said the HSE is working on a project to procure a National Immunisation Information System (NIIS), as the Republic does have a single integrated national immunisation database. Mr Donnelly has said interim options will be considered for the rollout of the Covid vaccine, if needed.MeetingA Government spokesman said the Data Protection Commissioner will be meeting with the taskforce, which he said is “standard procedure to ensure data is protected during the immunisation rollout”.Labour Party leader Alan Kelly, who raised the database issue in the Dáil on Tuesday, said he was “very surprised” these meetings are only taking place this week. “We literally have no database to store this information and continuously mine to ensure best rollout and continuous updating. This may also need some form of emergency legislation,” Mr Kelly said.It comes as the death of one further Covid-19 patient was reported on Tuesday by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet). This brings to 2,097 the total number of deaths in the pandemic. Nphet also reported 215 confirmed cases of the virus, taking the total number of cases to 74,682.There were 210 Covid-19 patients in hospital, including 31 in ICU.The 14-day national incidence of the disease now stands at 80.2 cases per 100,000 people. Donegal and Kilkenny are again the counties with the highest incidence, while Leitrim has the lowest.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “While each of us awaits our opportunity to be vaccinated, it is important that we continue to protect each other in the meantime, particularly over Christmas and in the months ahead.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431219.1607462225!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"groups representing key workers press for priority vaccinations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMargaret Keenan (90) is lauded by staff as she returns to her ward after becoming the first person in the UK to receive the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine at University Hospital Coventry. Photograph: PAGroups representing key workers are to press for their inclusion in priority categories for vaccination once the State begins to roll out its Covid-19 immunisation programme.On Tuesday, Cabinet approved 15 different cohorts for the sequence of vaccine roll-out, with healthcare workers, nursing home residents, older people and those at risk of severe disease to be given access first. The Department of Health said “key workers”, sixth on the list of categories, must provide a service essential to the vaccine programme. Those living or working in crowded accommodation where isolation and social distancing is difficult are ninth, while key workers who cannot avoid a high risk of exposure are 10th and “other workers in occupations important to the functioning of society” are 13th.Vaccinations are expected to be rolled out in January. The death of one further Covid-19 patient was reported on Tuesday, bringing the pandemic total to 2,097. A further 215 confirmed cases of the virus were reported, taking the total number of cases to 74,682.The department said the vaccination priority list was drawn up on an ethical basis, with the goals of fairness, reducing harm and protecting the vulnerable.While the groups acknowledged priority access for healthcare workers and the vulnerable was appropriate, they said their members should also be considered for inclusion in high categories. ‘Workplace vectors’Greg Ennis, a Siptu official who represents meat plant workers, said they should be vaccinated as “key workers” in the sixth tier because they face “unprecedented workplace vectors for the transmission of Covid-19”.Fórsa, the State’s largest public sector union, said it would press for State employees such as local authority staff, community sector workers and some civil servants to be included as key workers who cannot avoid a high risk of exposure. Mandate trade union general secretary Gerry Light said retail workers should be given the highest level of access possible. “If we define them as essential workers, let’s follow that up by doing everything we can to give them access to the vaccine on a priority basis.”PDForra (Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association) said ships crews cannot socially distance, while the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (Raco) said all personnel should be in this category and those engaged in swabbing should be included with healthcare workers.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431210.1607461912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scots braced for no deal we need parity with northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Alistair Roberts, vice chair of the Clyde Fishermen’s Association.

When combined with Brexit, it could put him out of business.Like many fishermen, he voted Leave, believing it would mean small boats like his would regain some of the UK’s fish quota. With fish remaining one of the sticking points in the trade talks, he is now far from hopeful.“It’s just one big mess at the minute and nobody knows what way to turn. We need parity with Northern Ireland, ” he tells The , reflecting the views of many of his fellows.Worried about a no-deal Brexit, he says: “At the end of the day we’ve been pally with the Irish fishermen for years and we don’t wish them any bad luck, but all we’re looking for is parity.”While supporting the Northern Ireland protocol “very strongly”, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister Michael Russell points out, however, that Scotland “voted more substantially to Remain, and we’ve had nothing at all”.‘Advantages’“I don’t think we yet know what the impact will be, but we expect it to be difficult, because quite clearly we will not have the advantages that are built into the protocol . We expect them to be substantial,” he said.In Cairnryan, lorries are still being loaded onto the ferry for the journey to Belfast without friction. Lorries arrive, they are checked in electronically in seconds, and join numbered lanes awaiting boarding.Come January 1st, however, Cairnryan and its fellow west coast port will find itself on the front line of the Irish Sea border between the United Kingdom and the European Union.Though much remains to be agreed, it appears highly unlikely at this stage that delays at ports because of checks and paperwork can be avoided come January 1st.Lorries could be “stacked” in Stranraer, which has more space than Cairnryan, because of custom and phytosanitary paperwork delays: “We do not have enough environmental health officers, not enough vets,” Russell says.While the agreement in principle reached between the sides on Tuesday on the protocol should provide clarity as to how the Irish Sea border will operate, those who will have to work it daily have yet to see the detail.By degreesHowever, Séamus Leheny from the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland is not alone in believing that it will come into force by degrees in the opening months of the new year.Firstly, there must be a period of grace for chilled food imports and a trusted trader scheme as argued for by major UK supermarkets to safeguard food supply chains from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.Tuesday’s deal is “a positive step”, says Leheny, not least because it gives industry “a bit of breathing space” to implement the protocol – and, he says, potentially creates the ground where a trade deal might be reached.The news will have been welcomed by truckers in Cairnryan, too.“I could have 200 deliveries in the one load. There will be terrible paperwork involved, and somebody’s going to have to do all that,” he told The .“This is fresh food,” says Michael Wauchop, pointing to his refrigerated trailer. “That can’t be held up for long, and Tesco wants it on the shelves as quickly as possible. They will have to come to some agreement.”“It’s all talk, hearsay,” says Mark Williams. “ Nobody knows what’s going to happen.” He shrugs. “I’m not that bothered about it – whatever happens will happen.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The lack of maternity leave for public representatives is a “glaring barrier” for women who want to enter politics, a TD has claimed.Social Democrats TD Holly Cairns said she is pushing for legislation to permit maternity leave for elected officials, following Minister for Justice Helen McEntee’s announcement that she is pregnant.Ms McEntee will become the first senior Cabinet minister to give birth while in office.Ms Cairns has offered to pair with the Justice Minister for all votes if changes to allow her take maternity leave are not introduced before she gives birth next year.“It’s kind of mad that she’s the first member of Cabinet to give birth while in office it’s even madder that there isn’t any provision for maternity leave. That goes for senators, councillors and TDs,” she said.Ms Cairns said when she was first elected to Cork County Council, female councillors spoke of the “trauma” of giving birth while being an elected official.“They were working from their maternity beds, they had to take sick leave which is, quite frankly, insulting, and their wages were being docked. Of course, they felt like they were being judged by the electorate for not being at council meetings and it’s just ridiculous in 2020 that we’re even talking about this,” she said.“I think the reality is if we had more women at these decision-making tables all along, we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation and perhaps if we had maternity leave for public representatives, we would have more women at those decision-making tables.”Ms Cairns first raised the issue with the Taoiseach back in July and has since been working on a Bill with the Bills Office in Leinster House. She hopes to get an update from the office later this week, but acknowledged there are “a lot of complications” in providing leave.“Obviously, the electorate vote for somebody to vote on their behalf and when we look at the option of having a replacement, like a locum, there’s a question there of can that happen when they haven’t been elected to vote on behalf of the people. Does that need to be included on the ballot? There are different questions like that,” she added.Ms Cairns suggested remote voting could also be used as a possible solution. She added that she hopes there will be cross-party support on the issue.Meanwhile, Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill introduced a Bill on Tuesday to enable remote voting in the Oireachtas, a move which, she said, could “remove the barrier to maternity leave” for politicians.“We have had lots of talk about maternity leave for politicians. This Bill is part of that conversation and is one of the first steps towards flexible maternity provision for TDs and Senators. At a minimum, maternity or paternity provision requires the possibility of remote or proxy voting,” she said.“I believe all workers who are parents with young children should be afforded parental discretion, including members of the Oireachtas. It should be the parents’ choice together as to how to spend the weeks and months following the birth, or adoption, of their new baby.”Legal reform for the provision of maternity care was promised more than 40 years ago but was never delivered. At present, TDs have to provide a sick note if they wish to take time off to be with their newborn children."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431237.1607464731!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin may look at constitutional change to allow politicians take maternity leave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Micheal Martin  told Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators that politicians needed to modernise how the Oireachtas does its business.    Photograph: Laura Hutton Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the Government might consider Constitutional change to ensure maternity leave, childcare and other issues for women in political life are addressed as a matter of urgency. He was speaking following the disclosure at the weekend there are no current provisions to allow Minister for Justice Helen McEntee - who is pregnant - take maternity leave.When efforts were made in 2018 to introduce maternity leave for TDs, the Oireachtas was told that such a law might be contrary to the Constitutional requirement for TDs to be available at all times to be summoned to the Dáil. Mr Martin said that reforms will be prioritised by the Government to support women in politics and he himself would work personally with the Oireachtas women’s caucus on this issue.“It is important that we bring progressive change on how parliament works. Constitutional change needs to be seriously considered on this issue to bring permanent and sustainable progress,” he said. No dealAddressing colleagues at the weekly parliamentary party, Mr Martin also said it was a positive development on the party of the British government to remove the offending clauses from its internal markets Bill to allow the protocol on Northern Ireland to be signed off. “Significant differences remain on the level playing field and there is an ongoing risk of a no deal Brexit,” he warned. “There is a route to a resolution on fisheries. The impact of a ‘no deal’ is very serious across the regions. If a ‘no deal’ emerges we have a very serous situation as a country along with Covid,” he said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly made a lengthy contribution on the Covid-19 vaccine plan, and also on the situation with regard to Nurses Pay. However, while several TDs who are at the meeting said Mr Donnelly had spoken well, it was a week too late. Senator Eugene Murphy told the Taoiseach the party and Government had missed the tone of the political mood on the issue of student nurses and pay. Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry also said it was a seek too late as far as the nursing issue was concerned. He told the meeting they had raised the issue of a bursary for student nurses last month. Like others he complained about a lack of strategy within the party on private members motion, saying that the Fianna Fáil response to last week’s motion was a disaster. “We need to have a head of messaging for the party, ideally a TD or at least someone with a political nose to road test issues and now how things will okay out and be received. “I asked several ministers last week who was in charge of messaging within Fianna Fáíl? None of them knew and neither do I and it shows,” he said.

In Dublin, Taoiseach Micheál Martin warned the Dáil that the situation was “very serious” and that the House could soon be “discussing preparations for a no-deal Brexit”.Later, Mr Martin told The  he welcomed the “positive and helpful” agreement yesterday between the EU and UK on the implementation of last year’s deal to avoid a hard border in Ireland. But he said he was “on the pessimistic side” about consensus on a free trade agreement in the coming days.And he told the Dáil that people should not “over-interpret” the agreement on the North as a sign that a trade deal is imminent.Some sources in Dublin believe that in making the agreement on the North, the British government has “boxed off” the incoming Biden administration’s concerns about Northern Ireland, clearing the way for a US-UK trade deal even if there is a no-deal Brexit.Downing Street said the prime minister would use the meeting with Dr von der Leyen tonight “to continue discussions on the future relationship” between Britain and the EU, while the European Commission said it would not be a negotiating session. Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost have outlined for the two leaders the remaining differences on fisheries, level playing field guarantees of fair competition and how to enforce any deal. Britain’s cabinet office minister Michael Gove will outline to MPs on Wednesday the details of the agreement on implementing the Northern Ireland protocol. Earlier, the EU and UK declared they had reached agreement on “all issues” regarding how to practically implement arrangements for Northern Ireland designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and signed last year.This allowed the British government to announce it would scrap controversial clauses of legislation that would have broken the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year, and which the Irish Government warned would have made a deal impossible.The two sides have agreed details of an EU presence in Northern Ireland to oversee how British officials administer checks on goods coming from Britain and elsewhere. Goods ‘not at risk’The British government said they had agreed on how to determine criteria for goods to be considered “not at risk” of entering the EU when moving from Britain to Northern Ireland, the exemption of agricultural and fish subsidies from state aid rules, and the finalisation of the list of chairpersons of the arbitration panel for a dispute settlement mechanism. Meanwhile, the largest ferry company operating on the Irish Sea has urged the EU to introduce a six-month “implementation phase” for post-Brexit customs because many businesses are not ready.Stena Line, the Swedish company whose ferries cross the Irish Sea more than 250 times a week, said there remains “many unanswered questions”, despite the EU and UK agreeing on Tuesday on how the Northern Ireland protocol for Irish Sea checks will operate under the Brexit deal.“The systems and infrastructure required for customs checks in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK will also not be finalised in time for January 1st, 2021,” said Stena Line’s executive director and Brexit spokesman Ian Hampton.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

And then there are other days when suddenly something happens. It happened to me a couple of weeks ago, and I just suddenly thought, what would she be like?”Reflecting on this year and the loss many people will be experiencing, the Most Rev Welby said: “I think for people around this country around the world, more than a million dead around the world this Christmas, there will be an empty chair. “And it will be painful, deeply painful. I think I\u0027d want to say be kind to yourselves. Give yourself time. Talk about the person. Be honest about your grief and your loss, that you miss them. There\u0027s no harm in tears”.  The Chief Rabbi added: “No two bereavements are the same. If anybody comes along and says, I know exactly what you\u0027re going through, they don\u0027t.

But the projections were out of date and vastly overestimated deaths.The UK Statistics Authority said there needed to be more transparency about data and how predictions were being made.It later emerged that the Government had redrawn its graphs so they no longer suggested that deaths could soon overtake those at the peak of the first wave.Many experts have complained that the data presented by the Government ahead of the lockdown was “riddled with errors” and exaggerated the need for a second lockdown, while Greg Clark, the chairman of the Commons science and technology committee, said the belated admission of errors was “of great concern”.A spokesman for the ONS said: “Our official estimates have not changed and these are the ones we advise to be used.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dismissed eton teacher seeks act parliament reinstate post","story":"A dismissed Eton teacher is seeking an Act of Parliament to reinstate him to his post, as he encourages his supporters to lobby MPs and peers to rally behind his cause.Will Knowland was sacked for gross misconduct after recording a lecture which questioned current radical feminist orthodoxy” and then refusing to remove it from his YouTube channel.If his dismissal is upheld by the school’s appeal panel, which met on Tuesday and is due to deliver its verdict early next week, he intends to invoke an obscure branch of legislation in a last-ditch attempt to win back his job.Writing to his supporters, he explained his strategy: “Another way in which I might hope to secure the support of members of both Houses of Parliament is by lodging a petition for a Personal Bill.“My petition would be to try and secure a Personal Act of Parliament reinstating me as a Master at Eton College. Like any Bill that goes through Parliament, there would be scrutiny by a Select Committee of my case, and any petition opposing the Bill by the College. Parliament would hear evidence and submissions from counsel.”Personal Bills are a form of Private Bills which relate to the “estate, property, status or style, or otherwise relating to the personal affairs, of an inidual”.They have traditionally been used for orce or to permit otherwise forbidden marriages and were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.But they have fallen out of use in recent years and the last Act resulting from a Private Bill was passed in 1987 to enable the marriage of George Donald Evans and Deborah Jane Evans.Mr Knowland explained to his supporters that the benefits of a Parliamentary procedure are that “it would allow Masters, and other members of the Eton Community, to be able to speak freely about these issues under the protection of Parliamentary privilege”.But he said that the possibility of bringing about the Personal Bill will “ultimately rest” on support he could muster from MPs and peers.“Therefore, if you do have contact with Honourable Members of either House, I would be forever grateful if you would convey your views on my case, and the need for freedom of expression to be protected while delivering a balanced curriculum of erse viewpoints to the wonderful students at the College,” he said.Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union which has been supporting Mr Knowland, said they will petition Parliament to pass a Personal Bill to intervene in his case if Eton does not reinstate him.“There’s so much at stake here, Parliament must be given an opportunity to make its feelings known,” Mr Young said.He warned that if Eton’s appeal panel upholds the decision to dismiss Mr Knowland, it could have a “chilling effect” in schools and make it “impossible” for teachers to talk about controversial ideas in the classroom.Eton College has been engulfed in a free speech row following Mr Knowland’s dismissal. His controversial lecture, titled “The Patriarchy Paradox” was part of the Perspectives course taken by sixth form students to encourage them to think critically about subjects of public debate.Mr Knowland alleged that he was banned from delivering the lecture to pupils and then dismissed after he refused to remove a video of it from his personal YouTube channel.Eton has said the dismissal was not a matter of free speech but one of internal discipline.The £42,500-a-year school has said it was left with no choice but to ask Mr Knowland to remove the video from the internet as it fell foul of equality laws.An Eton College spokesman said: “The appeal hearing has concluded and, as laid down by school procedure, a decision is normally delivered within seven calendar days.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"historical re enactment group had account suspended facebook","story":"A historical re-enactment group had its account suspended by Facebook after being mistaken for a US right-wing militia.Wimborne Militia recreates historic battles from the 17th century and helps out with other local events - including recently turning on a town\u0027s Christmas lights.Those behind the group believe their society, which uses historical costumes and licenced old-fashioned shotguns to re-enact the events, has been mistaken for right-wing US militias, full of people armed to the teeth with deadly weapons.But recently the administrators of the Dorset-based group all had their accounts suspended after the social media giant flagged the group as unacceptable.The group relies on social media to keep the public informed of its activities - especially during the coronavirus pandmemic.The group said in a post on Facebook: Hello, It seem that due to events overseas, Facebook is deleting anything to do with Militias.Unfortunately despite being a British Reenactment society we seem to have been caught up in the algorithm.So if this page disappears that is why. We shall have to start again!While the five deleted accounts were those of the group\u0027s administrators, the main page has remained online.Facebook began banning militia groups in the US after critics claimed the platform was being used to encourage violence.Facebook has since apologised and restored the militia member\u0027s accounts, a spokesman said on Tuesday.He said: The Group and accounts were removed in error and have now been restored. We\u0027re sorry for any upset this has caused and we\u0027ve taken steps to prevent this happening again.The five administrators for the Wimborne Militia public Facebook page all had their own accounts disabled by the social media giant.One such member was 64-year-old Chris Brown, who also runs the Wimborne Neighbourhood Watch Facebook page, and is the town crier.He went to great lengths to try and get his account back so he could once again run the pages, even emailing former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who now works at Facebook.Mr Brown, the founder of the Wimborne Militia, said: The first we knew something was wrong was last week when none of us could access our Facebook accounts.There was a message that appeared that stated \u0027your account has been disabled due to contraventions of community standards. This decision is irreversible.\u0027We had no idea what had gone on. We thought somebody had hacked our accounts at first.We couldn\u0027t get hold of anybody at Facebook. I even emailed Nick Clegg, who is the director of global communications at Facebook, but I\u0027m still waiting for a reply.The history enthusiast said that it could be the fault of a US-based algorithm, explaining: We suspected it was down to this business in the US where you have militia groups that are armed to the teeth and an algorithm is wiping off anybody who has the word militia on their page.It looks like Facebook made a blanket decision without checking us out. If they did it would have been fairly obvious that were aren\u0027t a dangerous, political group.We are an English Civil War re-enactment group with 17th century weapons which we had shotgun licences for.

A watershed. A turning point in the war against an unseen enemy that has taken a wrecking ball to our way of life and killed more than 61,000 people in these isles.Tuesday, dubbed V-Day, marked a breakthrough in our pushback against coronavirus with the launch of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Yet within hours came mixed messages from the OxfordAstraZeneca camp a troubling reminder that creating a vaccine in record time was always going to represent a challenge.A study confirmed our home-grown vaccine is safe and effective but there are concerns the efficacy may be closer to the 62.1 per cent achieved by two standard doses than the 90 per cent which felicitously resulted from an error that saw volunteers receive half a dose and then a full dose.This news should not take the shine off V-Day, however. By any standards, it is an astonishing milestone.The battle-weary public feared it might never happen, but in the event science prevailed - sooner than we had dared to imagine. In giving the Pfizer drug clinical approval before any other country, Britain finally proved itself to be genuinely world-beating.And so it was that at 6.31am precisely, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan made not just national headlines but human history when she became the first patient on the planet to be inoculated against Covid-19.At University Hospital in Coventry, Mrs Keenan, who turns 91 next week, was given the first of two shots. And the rest of us received a much-needed infusion of hope and optimism.Not before time. The all-in-this-together consensus of March had been starting to fray. Anti-vaxxers have been growing ever more strident. Young people are flouting regulations by gathering, not helped by pop singers and journalists forced to apologise for partying in public.Contrast their behaviour with that of the older generation - from Captain Sir Tom Moore to Her Majesty the Queen and now these early vaccine volunteers - who have been leading from the front, by example, with quiet dignity and old-fashioned stoicism.This is for a good cause I\u0027m so pleased I\u0027ve had it done, said Mrs Keenan. This is a terrible disease, we do want rid of it. I\u0027d say go for it - it\u0027s free and it\u0027s the best thing that has ever happened. If I can do it, so can you.Hours later, William Shakespeare, 82, received his jab at University Hospital in Coventry, leading to a wealth of gentle puns including Two Gentlemen of Corona, which would previously have been branded tasteless but on V-Day raised a smile.Other emotions were in evidence too. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welled up in public and the rest of us were reduced to tears by Gill Rodgers, 86, from Brighton, interviewed on the Today programme about her impending inoculation.I\u0027m a bit pleased, she said. Although it really doesn\u0027t seem fair I\u0027m getting it when so many other people need it too.Such selflessness was deeply moving, not least because Mrs Rogers lost her husband to Covid during lockdown.Lyn Wheeler, 81, from Bromley, south-east London, who received the jab, was delighted to take part in what she felt was very valuable work.You have got to realise that life is a bit of a risk and you can\u0027t keep hiding away, you have to stand up and go for things, she said.Fighting talk, inspiring sentiments and a reminder to younger generations that fortune favours the brave.When their turn comes, let us hope they have the courage to roll up their sleeves and Take It Like A Nan.Additional reporting by Jamie JohnsonMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thin skinned nicola sturgeon cant bear upstaged anyone even","story":"Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, likes banning things. She has banned drinking in pubs for millions of Scots, she has banned travelling, including across the border, and she would probably have banned Christmas if she could have got away with it. Even the Royal family aren’t immune from her thin-skinned puritanism – at least judging by the welcome Sturgeon gave the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their visit to Scotland this week.William and Catherine chose Edinburgh as the first stop on their morale-boosting nationwide tour. But while the Cambridges were brightening the days of key workers, a mile or so down the road, Sturgeon used her press briefing to tick them off. “We made sure that the Royal household were aware, as you would expect, of the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit,” she snipped.In fact, there are plenty of exemptions to her travel ban, such as for work that can’t be done from home. Sturgeon herself visits hospitals and regularly crosses between Glasgow and Edinburgh, in different tiers until yesterday. The royals have taken to Zoom like everyone else during Covid, but there’s no substitute for seeing them in the flesh, parched as we are of any sort of excitement. Even in Scotland, where republican sympathies run high among more extreme nationalists, most polls show a strong majority in favour of the monarchy. It’s why the Nats have been careful not to alienate voters with open republicanism, most notably in the 2014 independence referendum, when Alex Salmond insisted the Queen would remain head of state in a separate Scotland.So, what was Sturgeon thinking when she so publicly rolled up the red carpet this week? She has been having problems within her party and this would have played well with its most ardent Levellers.But a likelier explanation is that she was simply peeved. More than any other leader in Britain, she has treated the pandemic as a personal crusade, with herself as Scotland’s saviour. The First Minister has had almost no opposition since March, or in fact anyone to take attention away from the Sturgeon show. In this she has been abetted by the BBC which has given her a daily platform (apart from one small blip when they tried and failed to take her off the air) to milk the pandemic dry.She has devised Covid rules almost for the sake of being contrary and treats any flouting of her curbs as a direct affront, to be avenged with the threat of stricter measures.Having conceded to a four-day seasonal reprieve in line with the rest of the UK, for example, she quickly backtracked, warning of the dangers lurking in communal cutlery and exchanging presents indoors. We know, because she told us, that she won’t be with her parents this Christmas and hasn’t seen them since her birthday in July. Hers is a joyless Scotland, where her sacrifices are pitted against the “selfish” actions of those who dare to disobey.You would have thought that the First Minister would have been grateful to the Cambridges for raising the spirits of lockdown-weary Scots. Yet in Sturgeon’s eyes at least, nobody should be allowed to upstage her in her kingdom.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"v day watershed moment may have wear masks another year","story":"The public may have to wear masks for another year, despite a “watershed moment” beginning Britain’s national vaccination programme, Sir Patrick Vallance has said.As hospitals across the country began administering jabs to the most vulnerable, the chief scientific adviser suggested that restrictions may remain in place long after its full rollout.On Tuesday, there were scenes of jubilation across the country, as the programme got underway. Grandmother Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, was the first person in the world to receive a jab outside of clinical trials, proclaiming it the best early birthday present.Next week the NHS will expand its vaccination programme, with the Pfizer jabs rolled out beyond 70 hospitals to around 300 GP hubs, targeting those aged 80 and over.Between 1.2 and 1.6 million further doses of the Pfizer vaccine are due to be delivered to the NHS next week, it emerged on Tuesday night. The remainder of the four million doses destined for the UK before the end of the year will arrive in a consignment the following week, according to The Times. Health Secretary said he hopes “several million” people will be vaccinated by Christmas.However, the joy was tempered by warnings from ministers that those who receive the vaccine should not be able to expect extra freedoms, such as to hug a grandchild.And the chief scientific advisor (seen below) went further, to suggest that the public may be expected to still be wearing masks next winter, because of a lack of evidence to show whether the vaccines prevent transmission, as well as stopping the virus take hold. Meanwhile, there were fears that a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca may not be as useful as was first thought. Scientists said detailed data published in The Lancet showed more research is needed to demonstrate that it can protect the elderly.Three weeks ago, researchers behind the vaccines announced they had efficacy rates of 90 per cent among those given a half dose, followed by a full dose several weeks later.However, among those who received two full doses, efficacy was just 62 per cent, compared with an efficacy rate of 95 per cent shown for the Pfizer jab.Scientists said the detailed findings in the Lancet paper (which showed a minority of those in the study were elderly) have left regulators with a dilemma.The Oxford data is currently being studied by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which will decide whether to approve the jab. The report showed the half-dose trial only “provides a suggestion” that it would be more effective, saying more research is needed. None of those given the half-dose vaccine were over the age of 55, while just 12 per cent of those in one analysis of the full dose were older people.The study also found the two dose regime only plays a small role in preventing transmission.Experts said regulators would now be in a quandary about whether to approve the low dose vaccination, or allow it to be used in older people.However, Government sources said an efficacy rate of 62 per cent would provide significant protection to the population, above the rates given by annual flu jabs. They said decisions would be taken by the regulator, with hopes of authorisation by Christmas. One highlighted previous comments by deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam (seen below, speaking in early December) that the country could not afford to make the perfect the enemy of the good, urging those eligible to take whatever vaccine they are offered. However, there were warnings on Tuesday that Britain is “not out of the woods yet, with those given the vaccine told they should not expect extra freedoms. On Tuesday, the Government said that having the vaccine would not allow people to stop social distancing or wearing masks because it is unclear whether the jab prevents transmission, so they may still infect others. People visiting care homes were also warned that they should only hug and hold hands with relatives if they are wearing PPE, even if they test negative.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said they would be monitoring transmission rates as the vaccine was rolled out and that although vaccines provided a “route out” of the pandemic, people must still stick to the rules.Although millions of people are expected to be vaccinated by Christmas, they will only have had the first dose, and will not be protected fully until January, he warned.The Health Secretary repeatedly urged the public “not to blow it” in its efforts to fight the virus now that the vaccination programme is underway.And Sir Patrick said: It may be that next winter even with vaccination we need measures such as masks in place we don\u0027t know yet how good all the vaccines are going to be at preventing the transmission of the virus.The Government scientist also said it would take “quite a long time” to make sure everyone in priority groups receives their jabs, urging the public to “stick to the rules”.Sir Patrick said that the public could not afford to “let our guard down” as the vaccine is rolled out. Tory MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), urged the Government to set out how freedoms would be restored to Britons who have received the jab.It’s really positive news that those most vulnerable to Covid-19 are now starting to get vaccinated, he told The .They will be wondering, once they’ve had their second doses and are fully protected, how quickly they can start seeing their children and grandchildren and getting back to normal. It would be a real benefit if the Government could set that out as soon as possible.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, said the trial results in the Lancet “presents regulators with something of a dilemma.”  He said that while the data was “most compelling” for those given a half dose in their first jab, where a reduction in asymptomatic transmission was also seen, this group was small and included no older people.  “It remains possible that if the regulators allowed the vaccine to be used in this manner, the most at risk group may not be protected, he said. Dr Julian Tang, honorary, clinical virologist, Respiratory Sciences, University of Leicester, added: “A lower vaccine efficacy does run the risk of leaving a large proportion potentially unprotected, despite being vaccinated. “Those who have been vaccinated and think they are immune may behave more freely, which may serve to spread the virus further if they do become infected.”On Tuesday, the vaccine team from Oxford University said they hoped to see regulatory approval in the coming weeks. Prof Andrew Pollard, professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity at the University of Oxford, said a range of different vaccines were needed to beat the pandemic. “I think what we need are vaccines in people\u0027s arms and I personally think we need to be completely agnostic about which vaccine we use, because we want multiple vaccines, as soon as possible. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, said: “A vaccine that is proven to be effective is one that will save lives.“The MHRA has authorised the PfizerBioNTech vaccine for use based on an assessment of its safety, quality and effectiveness, and the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) has given advice on priority for use of that vaccine.“Currently we have one vaccine authorised for use in the UK and it is speculative to compare further products at this stage. Any future potential vaccines will be assessed with exactly the same rigour. ”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10000 worth christmas presents being","story":"AdvertorialWhy £, worth of Christmas presents are being given to people who buy milkGraham’s The Family Dairy is surprising customers with hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine at top restaurantsmirrorShareCommentsByDave MastersHelena Pozniack:,  DEC AdvertorialDr Robert Graham, chairman of Graham’s The Family DairyCows still need milking, even in the middle of a pandemic. And owners of Graham’s The Family Dairy in Scotland have continued to rise at am throughout this year to tend their  strong herd of Jersey cows and ensure customers as far away as the Highlands can get milk delivered to their doors.   But while dairy purchases have soared, Graham’s has seen the fortunes of local hospitality businesses plummet - and the family wanted to help out with a Christmas Advent of giving. Thataposs why every day in December in the run up to Christmas, Graham’s is giving away gts to customers - in the form of hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine out at some of Scotland’s best local restaurants - to the value of £, in all.  As part of our campaign with KFC, we are sharing stories of everyday people doing extraordinary things to help their community - those heroes who want to give people more of what they love. And today we salute Graham’s The Family Dairy for doing just that. “As a family of farmers, it’s not an option to stop milking our cows - le goes on. We soon realised people needed more help than ever,” says Dr Robert Graham, chairman of the dairy in Stirlingshire, who’s worked on the farm in the village of Bridge of Allan all his le, and still oversees the early morning milking. “Our teams have worked incredibly hard over the past few months, and with Christmas coming up, our business wanted to give something back to communities. “Eating good Scottish food with friends and family is such a pleasure,” says Dr Graham, who hopes the scheme will spread a little Christmas joy now and into the new year. “The past few months have been incredibly tough for restaurants and cafes as most of them are small family-run operations.”  When lockdown began earlier this year, Graham’s, which works with more than  farmers across Scotland, mobilised teams to deliver milk, butter and other fresh products direct to more people’s houses as customers stocked up on home baking staples such as butter, eggs and cream. Founded by Dr Graham’s father in , the business has grown from pony-and-cart doorstep deliveries to supplying shops, hotels and restaurants around the UK. Dr Graham works with his son , who’s now managing director and daughter Carol who leads marketing. It was Dr Graham who back in the s decided to buy some  Jersey cows from the Queen’s herd in Windsor - these produce the rich creamy milk for which the dairy is renowned. Keen to help out local cafes, the dairy has also decided to appoint a new milk ambassador in recognition of a café owner or barista whose community spirit shines through. Staff were won over by a local coffee lover and entrepreneur Michelle Kibaris, owner of Fallen Tree Coffee, who runs a mobile coffee truck around rural Blair Drummond near Stirling. She thinks the rich gold-top milk produced by Graham’s Jersey herd makes the best coffee and is delighted to receive free milk from the dairy for a year - worth some £. “I have so many ideas for the business,” she says. For many, food is more than just fuel to keep us going, it’s a way of showing our love and bringing comfort in a dficult time. This year may have been tough but it’s good to remember it has also served up some incredible stories of kindness, determination and joy in communities across the UK. And we think that calls for more…gravy! To add some festive cheer, and give us all more of what we love, KFC have created the new Gravy Burger Box Meal, featuring a fillet burger with added gravy!

The departmentaposs planned upgrades to computer systems has been delayed by three years, the report found. Whitehallaposs spending watchdog the National Audit Officefound the Government department did not deliver improved digital border systems to its planned timetable of March . They said the delay had increased costs by £ million and means it continues to rely on legacy technology. The rollout of the new system has been pushed back to the end of March , the NAO said, adding: The Home Office has made improvements, but it still faces signicant risks in delivering and integrating its new systems against a challenging timetable. Border Force is using a -year-old system for its passenger watchlist to check whether suspects and persons of interest are trying to enter the country, while another system which analyses passenger data is  years old, according to the findings. The department set out to upgrade the old computer systems in  because they were increasingly expensive, dficult to maintain and unfit for work to be carried out in the future. Improvements were intended to provide UK Border Force staff with better information to make decisions about people crossing the border and to track goods entering and exiting the UK, the NAO said. But the plan lacked a timetable and clear objectives as well as a budget. The amount of work needing to be done was also underestimated by the Home Office, according to the body. In July last year, the Home Office updated the plan as it worked to tighten control over who enters the UK and decided to delay its introduction by three years, adding hundreds of millions of pounds to the bill for the work.  The department estimates that the net impact of its failure to deliver the programme by the end of March  as originally planned is an additional cost of £ million, the NAO said. The report also warned of technical problems with the Home Officeaposs new system to monitor the watchlist of suspects and people of interest, which will check passenger details against electronic visas and look at whether they have a legal right to remain in the UK under the EU Settlement Scheme. The NAO said an earlier version of the new programme - called Border Crossing - had problems with most of its pilot trials in December last year, with six out of seven ports using it to check less than % of passengers. The system is set to be rolled out to  ports by the middle of June. Head of the NAO Gareth Davies said: The Digital Services at the Border programme did not achieve value for money by March , failing to deliver what it intended and leaving Border Force staff to rely on outdated legacy systems. Since resetting the programme, there have been improvements and the Home Office has a better understanding of the signicant risks and challenges ahead. It now needs to build on this work to ensure that it can deliver the programme at the pace and scale it requires.

Ineos Automotive confirmed its new x cars will be manufactured in France, ending hopes that a new plant in Wales could be built. The firm said the former Mercedes-Benz Hambach factory in Moselle, France, will build the Grenadier vehicles instead following a deal with the German carmaker. Production of a new vehicle was due to begin in Bridgend next year, creating around  jobs initially, rising to  once the vehicle reached full production. But Ineos starting hinting that plans could change during the summer as the Hambach site looked more attractive. The company said on Tuesday the new factory was well located for access to markets, suppliers and automotive talent. The decision is the second major blow for Bridgend, where the initial site was due to open, as it had been planned to be beside the now-closed Ford engine plant.Ford shut its factory in September after  years, with the loss of nearly , jobs, in a long line of car manufacturers to leave the UK or reduce output over Brexit concerns.Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratclfe, a prominent Brexit supporter, said: Hambach presented us with a unique opportunity that we simply could not ignore: to buy a modern automotive manufacturing facility with a world-class workforce. Ineos Automotive set out a vision to build the worldaposs best utilitarian x, and at our new home in Hambach, we will do just that. The site currently builds electric vehicles, which Ineos will continue to produce, but the move is expected to be a bitter blow for Wales, with politicians actively courting Sir Jim for investment in the region. Chris Elmore, MP for Ogmore in Bridgend, tweeted the decision was a crushing blow for the area.

He said: “Jobs, businesses and lives depend on a solution to this. We need to sort it out right away. “The mental health crisis has grown all year. There is a mental health crisis that will exist beyond the pandemic and there is clear evidence that this failure to support excluded groups has had an impact. “Only the Chancellor can bring these people in from the cold.” It comes as a separate survey found one in  excluded people reported they were suffering from mental health issues.

Nick Gibb told MPs that heads would be able to hold inset days at the end of term to ensure a “clear six days” before Christmas Eve. Schools have been demanding freedom to move to remote learning earlynecessary, to reduce the risk of pupils and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas - and the burden on teachers to do contact tracing over the holidays. Up to , state school pupils missed school on December  due to coronavirus - between % and % of pupils - according to the latest Department for Education figures. More than a quarterof schools had one or more pupils self-isolating and nearly a fthof secondary pupils were off school. Unions have warned that attendance rates could drop in the final weekparents take children out early to prepare for a family Christmas. “It is important that schools remain open, and .% of schools are open,” Mr Gibb told the Commons Education Committee. “But what we also want to ensure is that teachers and heads, in particular, who are delivering the track and trace for any pupil or staff identied, who’s got a positive Covid staff, they then engage in the track and trace of their contacts – we want to make sure that they can have a proper break over Christmas.” He said schools could hold inset days on Friday, December , to give them enough time before Christmasteachers need to engage with test and trace. Mr Gibb said: “We want there to be a clear six days so that by the time we reach Christmas Eve staff can have a proper break without having to engage in the track and trace issues.” The last-minute guidance comes after the Government told schools they were not allowed to close early for the Christmas break as part of the Covid Winter Plan. Academy chain Focus Trust, which runs  schools in the North West of England and West Yorkshire, was forced to reverse its plan to extend the Christmas break by an extra week to safeguard staff and families.

The Resolution Foundation said £ per week of statutory sick paywas “woefully inadequate” and more Covid- infections had occurred as people could not afford to stay home. Around two million employees earning less than £ a week are not eligible for SSP – a barrier that excludes one in four part-time workers, and one in seven workers in retail, hospitality and leisure. Meanwhile, £ payments from Test and Trace are not reaching enough people, with only one-in-eight workers entitled to them, the report found. Only , payments were made between October  and November  by local authorities in West Yorkshire, which has one of the highest infection rates in the UK, researchers said. The think tank called for the furlough scheme to include self-isolation payments, at a cost of around £million a month. Self employed workers should be given grants of up to £ through the dedicated scheme. And the self employed who do not qualy for the Chancellor’s added support should received boosted Employment Support Allowance, uprated from £ to £ per week.Researcher Maja Gustafsson said: “ Coronavirus vaccines will take many months to roll out so more workers will need to self-isolate at home to contain the spread of the virus next year.“Given the failure of the current sick pay regime, the Government must turn now to the far more successful job support schemes to provide workers and firms with the financial support they need to do the right thing.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said lack of decent sick pay was a “gaping hole” in the government’s Covid strategy.

While the cityaposs Housing Executive tried to find them a new place to stay, the Donoghues spent eight weeks living out of suitcases. Today they were told that they have a new place to call their own. Mum of  Tessa Donoghue has said her family have been left with nothing following their eviction, as they were unable to find anywhere to store their belongings and had to leave them behind when they went to the hotel. She said they had to live off takeaways and were unable to cook or store their own food in the hotel for health and safety reasons. To make matters worse, Tessa is expecting her th child in February. The mum has been told he may require heart surgery once he is born. Tessa said: The past eight weeks have been hell for us living in this hotel. Because we were unable to find a storage unit for our possessions, we have had to leave everything behind and now we have nothing. No furniture, fridge, freezer, beds or anything. While the hotel have been amazing to us, giving us our own rooms and nearly an entire floor to ourselves, the children are scared to be alone in the rooms by themselves and come into our room to sleep with their sleeping bags. We canapost do any of our own cooking, as we donapost have a fridge to store fresh food or even anything to cook it with, so we have had to survive off takeaways, which has made this entire ordeal very expensive. Not to mention the fact we have to pay to park our cars outside the hotel everyday.

Speaking to CNN reporter Cyril Vanier, Mr Kenyon explained that he had travelled into London to receive the vaccine - but was late for his appointment as he couldnapost park the car. When asked why he had decided to take it, he said: I don’t intend to have it there’s no point in dying when I’ve lived this long, is there  I don’t intend to anyway. Mr Kenyon added that his family were unaware of his decision and that he was going to head home and tell them. He said: I rang up Guyaposs Hospital, which I know very well as Iaposve lived in London most of my grown le. and I said...youaposre doing the vaccination and they said yes. Then they spent time asking me some questions about this and that..not very interesting and I said yes, no, yes, no and they said come at half past . Well of course, I couldnapost damn well find anywhere to park my car so I was late. Anyway Iaposm here now and I got inside and they duly put me down on the list and I went off and had a rather nasty lunch and then came back, and they were ready for me. And no, it didn’t hurt at all – I didn’t know the needle had gone in until it had come out. It was very interesting, it was painless. Mr Kenyon received his vaccine a few hours after the first Brit, Margaret Keenan, . Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he felt emotional as he saw the image of Mrs Keenan being vaccinated. Like many around the country, the gran has been self-isolating for most of this year and is planning on having a very small family bubble Christmas to keep safe.

Mark Jonesapos seven-year-old daughter Emily died on March  after being stabbed in the throat by schizophrenic Eltiona Skana, , in a park in Bolton, Greater Manchester. In a heart-wrenching statement read to court Mr Jones asked How can you put into words how you feel about the senseless death of your only child  He said Emily was the beat in their hearts and their reason for getting up every morning. He added: How can an innocent child, playing in the park, be killed in such a violent and monstrous way  Over the course of a seven-day trial this month, the court heard Skana grabbed Emily as she was riding a scooter towards her mum on Motheraposs day. The defendant then slashed the child across the neck with one hand and threw her to the ground before attempting to escape the area. Mr Jones paid tribute to his little girl today in a heartbreaking statement read out at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, where Skana is being sentenced for manslaughter. Skana was found not guilty of murder after a trial but previously admitted to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Jonesapos emotional statement was read to the court this morning by barrister Michael Brady QC. He said: How can you put into words how you feel about the senseless death of your only child  It is just too dficult to comprehend. Emily was the beat in our hearts, the spring in our step and the reason we got up every morning. Emily was our beautul, spirited little girl, a bundle of energy with an infectious personality. She was bright and funny, a kind child with not a mean bone in her body. Emily loved le and had not a care in the world. One smile from Emily and she had her daddy wrapped around her little finger.  Emily was a loveable child, full of innocence and wonder. She was just starting out on her path of le and her future has cruelly been cut so short. Our future has also been taken away. How can you enjoy le when the biggest part of it isnapost there anymore. We will never see Emily grow and become the wonderful young lady we knew she would become, we will never see her hold her own child in her arms, as we held her. Emily brought out something special in everyone who was lucky enough to be in her le. The loss of Emily has had a profound and signicant impact, not just on her family, but the whole community. Emily was someoneaposs school friend, a play mate and of course a grand daughter and a niece and she meant something very special and unique to each and everyone of them.

Lori Addison-Simmons, , said she gritted her teeth to carry on with her job at Hermes as she is a single mother needing to provide for her two children. But she described feeling depressed and anxious and being like a robot while working for the delivery company - which she joined in January, StokeonTrentLive reports. Lori would load her car at the firmaposs Fenton depot at am and work flat out to complete her delivery run around Longton and Dresden by pm six days a week.  The courier described how she changed car five times in the course of her one-year employment at the company. But what afflicted her most was how she had no time to be there for her two children. Lori said: “I was getting home late. My daughter goes to secondary school and she was coming in and I was not getting in until around pm. “It was not fair on her and when I was at home I was too tired to do anything.  The job is supposed to fit around you and your circumstances. But there was one day when I had  items and got a call to say there were another  on my run. My car was already full and yet I needed to go back to the depot to pick another  up. “The most I had in the house would be about  parcels. That includes big boxes and packets. My living room was once taken over.” Lori says she was paid for each item delivered. It was p for a packet and £ for heavier parcels. Matters came to a head last month when her vehicle broke down - with  parcels in her car. She secured cover to deliver some of the parcels and faced having to take the rest on foot.  Lori added: “I was told they had to go out that day. But I couldnapost take them on foot because some of the streets were right up the top of Abbey Hulton. I was not doing that. “I’d given them almost a yearaposs commitment and I couldnapost take anymore. “I loved the job because I loved the customers. They were the ones keeping me going but I felt just like a number. “Sometimes the customers don’t understand how pressured we are and when I went out to deliver I put a smile on and had a joke but sometimes I was dying inside because I was so upset. “During one of my rounds I broke down in the car and I just felt fed-up and ignored.

Mays who was married to Louiseaposs aunt, was found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court today.The -year-old, who had entered the witness box in his own defence and denied intending to kill Louise, claimed he had genuinely forgotten he had killed Louise. The killer said he only remembered when he was in prison in Bristol after being held in custody by murder squad detectives some weeks later. After the jury unanimously convicted Mays of murder, he showed no visible emotion but sat in his grey prison jumper and looked forward, although an audible gasp could be heard around the court. Mrs Justice May DBE, who had presided over the trial, told jurors: Members of the jury, we ask a lot in cases like this of our citizens. You cannot have imagined when the jury summons came through your door that you would be sitting on a case like this. Although asked to sentence straight away by both prosecution and defence counsel, the High Court judge retired and said she would read victim impact statements from Louiseaposs mother, father and step-father.  When Louise Smith went missing, the local area of Leigh Park became awash with missing posters and leaflets bearing pictures of her in a blue prom dress. Her face was beamed around the world in news stories after her body was found and details of her death were revealed during the trial of Mays, which started on November . The lawyer defending Mays had warned the High Court judge that a planned site visit, which involved busing the jury down to Leigh Park, could pose risks to his clientaposs safety, stating feelings run very high in the locality. Such were the concerns that Hampshire Constabulary was asked to have a large police escort block off certain roads.  Jurors were taken on a route which meant they avoided passing the home of Rebbeca Jayne Cooper, Louiseaposs mother, whose house had been covered in photos of Louise in her prom dress and now stood as a makesht shrine to the murdered teenager. Louise had been classed as a vulnerable child due to a history of self-harming, the use of anti-depressant medication and a volatile relationship with her mother. After a particularly bad argument with her mum, which was partly about her boyfriend Bradley Kercher, Louise went to stay with another aunt before being taken in by Chazlynn Mays, known as CJ, who boasted that she was the stronger auntie.  In reality CJ was herself an unemployed woman who lived off Employment Support Allowance and did not like to venture outside of her one-bedroom flat in Somborne Drive. Her main pastime was managing the affairs of her dependent husband, Shane Mays, whose phone, social media accounts and spending money she controlled. The court heard that a clinical review of the defendant found he had an extremely low IQ of , putting him in the bottom one percentile of people. He also scored in the . percentile range of memory, which tests his ability for retaining information over a short period Mays spent each day playing nine hours of Xbox video games and spending his £ allowance dished out by CJ in whichever way he wished - until Louise Smith arrived at the flat.  From the day Louise moved in with him on April  this year, Shane initiated bizarre play fighting games with her, one of which Louise captured in a video she sent to her boyfriend Bradley. In a message, Louise had said: Sorry babe, Shane just attacked me and started tickling my foot and s***. I was crying with laughter. Later messages between Louise and her friends showed evidence of rising tensions, as CJ barred Louiseaposs boyfriend from staying at the home and Shane Mays warned Louise thatshe did not start helping around the house, then he would start to get stricter with her. Louise, who was said to live through her phone, had told a number of online friends they are just vile and vowed to leave the Maysapos home, which she did on May  by going missing.  When she ed, she and the Mays were captured on CCTV going to the local shops to buy Rum, peach Schnapps and a number of sweets, which prosecutors suggested was an attempt by Shane Mays to get Louise drunk so he could sexually touch her. The next day, for reasons unknown, Mays and Louise walked together into Havant Thicket where he killed her. He claimed he had punched her repeatedly, kneeling over her body to deliver powerful blows until he heard her bones crack. Following her death, Louise, who was training to be a veterinary nurse, was described by her family as a smiley, generous person.

Matt Moulding, founder of Manchester-based The Hut Group, said about  staff had been gted free shares in the past  years. “We have created more millionaires than any other company in British corporate history,” he told the Mirror in an exclusive interview. “The shares are % gted, no-one has had to pay anything. We have genuinely changed so many lives.” Those quids in range from managers through secretaries and warehouse workers. The shares windfalls have already turned  workers at the firm into millionaires, he said. That number is set to rise as, of the near £billion worth of shares set aside for staff, around £million has yet to be handed out. Some of those benefiting from the £million will be graduates and school leavers who will get “le changing sums,” said Mr Moulding. The -year-old has enjoyed his own le changing surge in wealth after building The Hut Group into one of Britain’s biggest tech firms. His % stake is worth around £.billion and a surge in its share price triggered a £million shares payout for him.  On the focus on his fortune, the father-of-four said: “Look, I guess it’s to be expected in some form, but it’s not something I seek out. “I am doing this because I’m passionate about it. “There is a lot of focus around what my wealth might be, but the amount of money we have shared is off the chart. A driver with the firm less than two years has netted £,, which he used to buy a new car and book a dream family holiday to the US and Canada next year. The unnamed married father-of-two still has a stake currently worth another £, which he plans to put towards his children’s future. “It has changed our lives,” he said. “It’s something you dream about.” A senior manager, who also declined to give his name, sold up to £, worth of shares to pay for his wedding and the deposit on their first “dream” home. The -year-old, who started at the firm as an apprentice, still has shares currently worth £,. He said: “I am from a working class family and this is amazing, and humbling. “I have young children and this will allow me to help my children.”  Mr Moulding, who plans to donate his entire £, salary to charity, was born in Colne near Burnley in Lancashire, His first job was washing dishes, he was expelled from college for playing truant, became a factory hand, then started out selling CDs online before starting to run websites for other retailers. The Hut Group also sells everything from mascara to vegan protein bars. It floated on the stock market in September, and is worth £.billion. The firm’s stock market debut focused attention on Mr Moulding’s dual role as both chief executive and chairman. He denied he was a “control freak, and insisted the structure was common in a number of other big companies. There have also been question marks about his retention of a “golden share” that allows him to veto any takeover.  He said: “It has one pursue, there is not another single other benefit to it, it allows me to veto a hostile takeover, an international business coming along and buying the business. “It only lasts for three years in total and after that time we are at the mercy of the markets.” Mr Moulding also revealed an ambition to create another , jobs - , a year - by , nearly doubling in size.

Dr David Hepburn, an intensive care consultant at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport who caught Covid- himself, has discussed worries around the vaccine and why it is completely safe to take. Margaret Keenan, , was the first person to ever receive a Covid- vaccine, as apart of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history this morning. She was among up to a  people set up to have the jab, which arrived in an insulated container only minutes before the injection. Now the inoculations have begun, the next challenge is making sure people receive it with some anxious about taking the vaccine that Dr Hepburn described as a aposgame changerapos.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should not be afraid of getting vaccinated, and that people objecting to having the jab are ‘totally wrong’.He went on to say: ‘Itaposs safe, itaposs the right thing to do, itaposs good for you and itaposs good for the whole country.’ Dr Hepburn told WalesOnline : There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments, your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook In a QA he has spoken in depth about the vaccine including about possible side effects, how it is produced and explained why it as been able to be produced so quickly and stay safe. What was your reaction when you first heard about the new vaccine being approved  David Hepburn: It was fantastic news. I was absolutely elated because it was never a certainty we would get an effective vaccine so the fact they had one which was more than % effective could be a complete game-changer. I am and most of my colleagues are very pleased about that. Anything that can shorten the le of this pandemic has to be a good thing in my book. Some people are not necessarily anti-vaccine but they are concerned about how quickly it has been turned around. What do you say to those people  It may seem to have come along very fast and a lot of people are a bit worried about that. But when it normally takes  years to produce a vaccine a lot of that is dead time. If I wanted to develop a new vaccine the first thing you need to do is get seed money to do it and then I need to do investment rounds to get companies interested in putting the money into producing it. What I am also making the vaccine for can also be is a big problem. For example, say I come up with an idea for a vaccine for herpes. That is a disease that affects people fairly commonly but it is a bit niche and doesnapost have the huge, huge numbers we are seeing with Covid. One of the problems with getting a vaccine for something like that is that you need volunteers who are willing to try the vaccine and you also need a certain level of incidence in the community because the way studies are run in phase three is that you give half a people the vaccine and half the people a placebo. You follow those two groups till you get a trigger number of patients developing the disease. You are hoping that will be in the placebo group not in the vaccine group.  If you have a disease which isnapost very common in the community it can take years to reach the correct number before you can stop the trial. Because Covid is very widespread in the community and lots of people are catching it you can reach that level very quickly. Are there any other reasons that is has been produced so quickly  The other thing to say is there is no shortage of volunteers because everybody wants to see a vaccine for this disease so people were queuing up to be guinea pigs, essentially, for the first trial. Normally in vaccine trials the recruitment of your test groups takes an awfully long time so that cuts down the speed signicantly. Also the key is getting funding from drug companies or governments to pay for the research and that can often involve lots of resubmissions of funding applications which can be rejected or need to be changed. That red tape really slows things down. With Covid- lots of those barriers were removed because everybody is looking for a Covid- vaccine. Bringing out a vaccine and bringing it to trial takes a lot of money because you need to set up centres for recruitment etc. The whole process of finding funding and getting it approved and finding groups takes an awfully long time. But this has been made much quicker because Covid is the only game in town.  Every single vaccine and treatment could have side effects. Youaposve mentioned before it is a balance and weighing up the risks. Can you explain more about this  Vaccines are one of the safest treatments you can give people. We know that because there are lots and lots of vaccines out there that have been given for a number of years. You have the early reactions which are things like allergic reactions or short-term effects like feeling a bit rundown and a headache etc. These are very common with lots of vaccines. They usually happen within a couple of days of having it. There are rarer and more unusual side effects and here we are talking like between one in , to a one in ,, chance. Youaposve got to remember that vaccines are not a drug so they have got no pharmacological ingredients that are going to affect you in the same way that drugs do. They are either dead viruses that are injected into you so the body can recognise the viral proteins – and that is the basis of the Oxford vaccine – [or] alternatively they are a new type of vaccine called the mRNA vaccine which tells your body to produce a protein which is part of the virus so you are basically, rather than injecting a bit of dead virus into yourself, making your own bits of virus using your protein factories in your bodies so your antibodies can recognise it as foreign and deal with it.  So is it up to the person taking it to weigh up the risks  Every time we have a new set of flu vaccines there will be one or two people who suffer a form of vaccine reaction which is called antibody-mediated. This is when you get a vaccine and your body makes antibodies which are little proteins which recognise foreign invaders. What can happen is when you get a vaccine that instead of recognising the viral proteins of a foreign invader your body can accidentally, due to cross-reactivity, recognise some of your own cells as foreign invaders and then they prime your immune system to attack those cells. This can create something called Guillain-Barre syndrome and can happen after jabs but they can also happen after infections as well. That can cause worsening paralysis but generally does get better. There have been a few cases of that associated with the flu vaccine every year but in terms of the numbers of people who have a flu vaccine itaposs very, very small and very, very unlikely. You are more likely to get Guillain-Barre syndrome as a result of having food poisoning you get in your local takeaway then you are from a vaccine. It is all relative risk. You have up to one in a million chance of getting it from a vaccination but you have one in  risk of dying of Covid and probably a much higher risk of Long Covid. Think about operations. With operations there is a risk. There is a risk of bleeding and there is a risk of infection as well as blood clots and other things going wrong. Butthe operation is going to make you better you accept those risks – and vaccinations are exactly the same. Youaposre probably at more risk getting in your car every morning to take the kids to school. Our lives are all about calculated risks. Can misinformation about vaccinations be damaging  You have to weigh up the risks. I think most people are intelligent enough that they can weigh up the ious risks. You only have to look at the very much discredited and  work of Andrew Wakefield, who has now been struck off, who suggested there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This has been categorically disproved and he had a big agenda in this, carried out very unethical experiments and then drew a conclusion that no-one has ever been able to replicate. But even the suggestion of this put people off vaccinating their kids.  Do you think there is a problem with the amount of people who are getting their information from social media Lately there has been a move to,I quote Michael Gove, have had enough of experts.This vaccine has come about because of a lot of work by scientists and assessed by the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency who are very, very vigorous and independent scrutineers of these things. There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments and your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook  We all need to be looking at where we get our sources of information from. Are they credible  If a guy on Facebook is saying this is all a conspiracy but youaposve got most of the worldaposs scientists saying aposThis is not a conspiracy and here is the science behind itapos an intelligent person should be able to work out what is a more reliable source of information. I can understand people having misgivings of anything new and it does seem to have come about very quickly but actually understanding why it has come out quickly is important.

Grandson Conor Maton said the Strictly Come Dancing fan “jumped at the chance” to be the first person in the world to get the lesaving jab. The -year-old said his whisky-loving gran is a “larger than le” character who wanted to help get the country back on track. He told the Mirror: “It’s a massive deal for the country and we’re so proud of her for being the first person to get the vaccine. “The fact that she’s  years old -  next week - will hopefully give other people confidence to have the jab. “Gran decided to do this herself. She wanted to do it, there was no pressure. She wanted to do something good. “It sums her up because she’s a wonderful woman. We only found out a couple of days ago that she was going to be first. “This is big news for the country and the whole world. It’s really exciting. We’re really proud of her.” Coventry City fan Margaret had spent the two coronavirus lockdowns being cared for by her family. She was admitted to hospital several days ago after suffering breathing dficulties - but tested negative for Covid. As she made quick recovery, medics offered her the chance to have the jab -and she jumped at the chance. “We’re quite a private family so it’s been a bit of a shock to suddenly be thrust into the limelight,” said Conor. “But it won’t bother gran. Like I said she’s larger than le, so nothing will faze her. “She’s  next week so we’ll definitely be celebrating with a party. It will be pretty low-key though. “We’re all in a bubble so we’ll spend Christmas as a family. It will be extra special this year that’s for sure.” Margaret, originally from Enniskillen, has two children - daughter Susan Caton, , and son Philip Keenan, . She also has four grandchildren - Conor, his brother Liam, , and their cousins Tom Keenan, , and Kevin Keenan, . The pensioner moved from Northern Ireland to Coventry with her husband Philip in the s. She worked as a waitress in a pub before landing a job at Whetstone Jewellers, where she worked until she was . Philip died in , and Margaret has lived alone in her semi-detached home in the Ball Hill area of the city ever since. Her daughter lives five minutes away, while her son moved to Baldock, Herts, several years ago.  Conor said his gran is a huge Strictly Comes Dancing fan and a keen follower of the Sky Blues. “Gran loves watching Strictly,” he said. “She’s missed a week so she’s got a bit to catch up on. “She always keeps an eye on the Coventry scores. We’ve got Luton tonight and she’ll be interested to see how that goes. “She lives by herself and still goes to the shops and does odd jobs around the house. She’s very independent. “She’s definitely a super gran - she’s always been a super-gran in our eyes.” Margaret’s son Philip, a Cambridge University worker, described her as a “little person with a heart of gold”. He only learned his mother had made history when she called him this morning after having the jab. “Mum called and said she was on the television. I asked her when and she replied: ‘Now!’ I was just totally shocked,” he said. He added: “Up until five or six days ago she was seriously ill – she spent two days in the intensive care unit. “She had been short of breath for several weeks but got worse and worse,although it wasn’t coronavirus. “She still has high blood pressure and an elevated heart rate and both will need monitoring now, but she is doing well. “She’s sprightly. Last year she was up a ladder painting and decorating in my home. “When she comes to visit she goes out and about by herself – everybody knows her in the local cafes around here. “She is determined to live beyond  and has done everything possible to protect herself. “She’s a very sociable person and it has been hard for her to lose that contact with people during the pandemic. “She has bubbled with my sister and her family in Coventry, but otherwise mum has not left her house since March.”  Margaret’s neighbour Heather Connolly joked the pensioner would be “annoyed” that everyone knows her age. “You would never guess she was . She doesnapost look anything like her age and is so active and very independent,” she said. “You’ll see her outside keeping the Grove tidy, sweeping up leaves. She is just a real lady and everyone in the community loves her. Dilys Webb, , added: “Maggie likes to socialise and is very independent. She goes out every single day. “It’s very unusual for her to be in hospital and Iaposve no doubt sheaposll be back dragging her dustbin across the road for the bin men. “She really is an inspiration and the perfect person to be the first to have the vaccine.”  A patient named William Shakespeare became the first man in the world to get the Pfizer vaccine at Coventry’s University Hospital. Bill Shakespeare, , from the city, is named after the famous playwright who was born nearby in Stratford-upon-Avon. “It’s ground-breaking I think,” he said. “It could make a dference to our lives from now on, couldn’t it. It will be a precaution.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock appeared to break down in tears as he was shown footage of Bill’s comments on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. He said: “Well you know, it’s been such a tough year for so many people. There’s William Shakespeare putting it so simply for everyone you know, we can get on with our lives. “There’s still a few months to go, I’ve still got this worry you know. We can’t blow it now.” The Pfizer jab has already been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyfor the  million of the UK population aged  and over.  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationwill then decide which age groups to offer it to as more trial data emerges. Doses are tomorrow being administered at  hospital hubs around the UK before being rolled out at GP-led clinics from next week.  A -year-old man received a warm round of applause as he received the first Coronavirus vaccine deployed at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth this morning. Michael Tibbs said “It’s absolutely wonderful, I’m very lucky really. I hope everyone  is able to have it as it’s really no problem at all”. After spending the majority of the pandemic confined to his garden, Mr Tibbs continued to express his gratitude for still being here and that he’s “Looking forward to spending time with his grandchildren and his great grandchildren”. Michael Tibbs’ own son, who’s a GP, will also be getting involved in the distribution of the Coronavirus vaccine - “He’s a GP, why not use him ” he said. When asked what he thought of the vaccination and others of a similar age getting it he said: “We are so fortunate to be in this country with its National Health Service. It really is excellent”. Anthony Moore, , from Sheffield said he was delighted to get the jab saying: “We haven’t been out of the house all year. It’s like winning the pools”. Boris Johnson vowed Britain “will beat this together” as the first coronavirus vaccines were pumped into arms. The Prime Minister, who visited Guy’s Hospital in central London to meet some of the first patients inoculated, said the jabs would eventually make a “huge dference”. The PM urged people not to be afraid of getting inoculated. “To all those who are scared – don’t be,” he said. “You have seen people take the vaccine this morning in large numbers. There’s nothing to be nervous about.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman allergic christmas festivities could","story":"NewsWoman so allergic to Christmas that festivities could leave her blindEXCLUSIVE Victoria Osborne cant be near articial trees, decorations, wrapping paper and scented candles and is also crippled with chronic migraines triggered by bright flashing lightsmirrorShareCommentsByPaul Byrne:,  DEC NewsVictoria Osborne reacts badly to Christmas Day \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Victoria Osborne, , suffers from such extreme allergic reactions at this time of year she could go blind. She cannot be near articial trees, decorations, wrapping paper and scented candles and is also crippled with chronic migraines, triggered by bright flashing lights, such as dazzling Christmas displays. The mum-of-one has a severe allergy to formaldehyde, which is used to preserve dead bodies but also found in articial trees, ornaments, Christmas crackers, perfumes, and cleaning products. Exposure causes her eyes to burn like “rings of fire”.  Her eyelids swell to such an extent that blood flow is restricted and her doctors say she is at risk of losing her sight. Speaking on how it affects son Gabriel, , Victoria, said: “I watch everyone  going mad at Christmas, Elf on the Shelf, pyjamas, special drinks, tons and tons of food. We have none of that. I feel terribly guilty that Gabriel can’t have a proper Christmas. Bless him, he accepts it because he doesn’t want to make me ill. “I wish I could give him the magic of Christmas that he truly deserves, but it’s just not possible.  The last time I put decorations up, he was five, and I got so ill, I remember nothing at all.” Victoria, who also lives with her mum Colleen Dickens, , in Formby, Merseyside, enjoyed a typical Christmas as a child and dermatologists are baffled as to why she has developed such le-changing sensitivities. She believes the reactions may be linked to a genetic condition she suffers, a hypermobility iety of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Despite struggles all year round Victoria said: “At Christmas it’s really hard.The weather is darker and there are so many articial lights.They really hurt my eyes – it feels like shards of glass every time I blink.

One woman, named Mel, recently stumbled across three clever kitchen utensil hacks on the social media  and the video of her reacting to them is simply priceless. Posting on the account @melbell, the woman watches someone from @foodie_we carry out them all in absolute awe. The first trick shows someone using the hole in the middle of a pasta scoop to create perfectly neat meatballs. They simply press the back of the spoon into a bowl of mince meat and the meat goes through the hole to form a ball. Next the back of a ladle is dipped into a batter mixture, removing excess drips. The ladle with the mixture on it then gets dunked into a pan of hot oil and cooks the batter, creating mini taco shells. The final hack shows someone using a pair of tongs to cut a slice of cake. They simply use the end where the tongs are joined together to cut through the songe, they then squeeze slightly to pull the piece out and place it on a plate. Mel watches the hacks with wide eyes, asking: How did I not know this ! The cake one really gets to her with her raising her hands to hold the sides of her face, mouth open in shock, as she says: Youaposre kidding! More than , people have liked her reactions, with many commenting to say they were also impressed by the hacks.One replied: I am today years old when I realised this.

Professor Haim Eshed, , says extraterrestrials have struck a deal with the US to stay silent while they conduct experiments on Earth and will only reveal themselves when mankind is ready.The retired general, who headed Israelaposs space programme for almost  years, claims the aliens have a secret base on Mars, the Jewish Press reports. But according to the professor, the alien race had to intervene to stop Donald Trump from blowing their cover and revealing their secrets.Speaking to Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonoth, Prof Eshed said: The aliens have asked not to announce that they are here. Humanity is not ready yet. The UFOs have asked not to publish that they are here. Humanity is not ready yet. According to Prof Eshed, MrTrump alsonegotiates with senior extraterrestrials via calls to world leaders such as Kim Jong-un. He added: Trump was on the verge of revealing, but the aliens in the Galactic Federation are saying aposwait, let people calm down firstapos, he told the Israeli paper. They don’t want to start mass hysteria. They want to first make us sane and understanding. The term aposGalactic Federationapos has been used in works of science fiction, including the TV phenomenon Doctor Who. Prof Eshed did not say how long the aliens have been hiding in the shadows but claims they have signed a contract with the US to do experiments here. He said the extraterrestrials will not reveal themselves until mankind has evolved and reached a stage where we will generally understand what space and spaceships are.  Prof Eshed holds a bacheloraposs degree in electronics engineering, a masteraposs degree in performance research and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering. The respected academic suggests that some of the presumed contact took place during Trumpaposs leadership and referred to an agreement between the US government and the alien race. He claims the extraterrestrials, who come in peace, wanted to study the fabric of the universe by working with American agents.

The first vaccines in Scotland will be administered today too.”mdash Nicola SturgeonDecember , The first vaccinations against the virus will begin at  centres across Scotland today, with those who are lined up to administer the injection to others receiving it first.They will be followed by residents in care homes from December , their carers and other frontline health workers, before prioritising those over  “as supplies allow”.On Monday, Ms Sturgeon met staff co-ordinating the vaccine at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.The First Minister had a tour of the facility and learned about the detailed preparation which has gone into organising the delivery of the vaccine.Speaking at the hospital yesterday, Ms Sturgeon said: #I’m grateful to everyone involved in giving this vaccine to those who need it most.“By vaccinating the priority groups they will be covering those associated with  per cent of preventable Covid- deaths. That is a very compelling reason to put these groups first in the queue for this vaccine.“Finally there is light at the end of the tunnel. But I ask everyone to be patient as we work our way through this vaccination programme, and continue to follow FACTS to keep us all safe.”UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Good Morning Scotland the next doses of the Covid- vaccine will arrive next week.He said: “The next scheduled arrival will be next week and the numbers depend on how quickly Pfizer can manufacture it.“It is being manufactured in Belgium and obviously right across the UK the job is to be able to get the vaccinations done as quickly as the manufacturer can create it, so we’ve been all working together really closely, the UK Government, which has been buying the vaccine and getting it delivered into the country, and then the NHS in the four nations of the UK.”Asked how quickly the vaccine can arrive and in what sort of numbers, he replied: “We’ve got a broad schedule, there will be several million for the UK as a whole, so several hundred thousand for Scotland over the remainder of this month.“We’ve got that as a broad delivery schedule but obviously the manufacturing process itself is complicated, so we’ve got to get the stuff in the country and then once it’s in the country we can be confident that we’re able to deliver it, and I’m sure the NHS across Scotland and across the whole of the UK is up to the challenge.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

the fixed point that assessors use to calculate values # moved back to .Business rates are currently based on valuations done in , before the oil and gas downturn, and transitional relief set up to mitigate the disparity between rateable and real values is set to expire at the end of this financial year.Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerceis now calling for a region-specic deal to reflect the extra challenges being faced by north-east firms.Shane Taylor, research and policy manager at AGCC, told the committee that business rates had been a #key challenge# for the region and the decision to delay the revaluation would present #some real challenges# locally.#I think there#s both a national and local north-east policy focus here,# he said. #The key one is understanding for retail, for hospitality, how the business rates relief will phase out.#Many in those sectors are looking towards what will potentially be quite a challenging Christmas and an unclear path after that in terms of the footfall challenges and working habit changes.#So the key focus there would be the government setting out very clearly what the path will be for rates at the next budget, what the path will be for rates relief, particularly for those key sectors that are most impacted.#And I think equally for the north-east more broadly, our view is, there#s a need to focus on a specic regional rates deal for this region as well because that delay in the revaluation means that the region is going to be facing rates which don#t reflect reality for a signicant additional period of time.#Some of the industries hardest hit by restrictions imposed by the Covid- pandemic, including hospitality, retail and live events, are also those with the largest business rates burden, and industry leaders fear the wrong move could put jobs at risk.Prior to last week#s vote, the AGCC attempted to put forward a compromise that would see the tone date moved to , to still take into account the impact of the pandemic, but with the revaluation date being kept to , so the north-east could have values #corrected in a reasonable amount of time#.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr Taylor said raising the issue is just the #first point# and the group intends to begin further discussions with ministers in the days and weeks ahead.#The transitional relief reflected the economic conditions and the hope that things would eventually improve,# he said.#We saw a bit of that with the recovery the region has had over the last few years off the back of the downturn but it#s still quite a precarious recovery.#Now we#re at the point where effectively we#re not quite back to square one but the region has gone through a very clear further economic clash and we#re not going to get those rates sorted in the next revaluation any earlier.#That means it will be three years, effectively, before the values get corrected.#Finance secretary Kate Forbes argued it would be “irresponsible” for the Scottish Government to proceed with  revaluation based on information at April , when Scotland was just one month into lockdown.Ms Forbes said the original plan would lock businesses into revaluations that did not reflect the impact of the pandemic.She added: “These regulations are based on an understanding of the risks to businesses which is, in turn, based on the most robust and veriable evidence and data that we have.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

routine testing because it is a group we are not monitoring closely at the moment.A study from Public Health England found that people with learning dficulties had a death rate of up to six times higher than the general population.:Coronavirus vaccine: My delight at being one of the first to get Borders jabThe report found that people with learning dficulties are likely to have problems recognising coronavirus symptoms, therefore potentially putting those caring for them in a vulnerable position as well.The executive member for adult wellbeing, Tom Weatherston, said he is ldquoconfident the council is supporting staff who are caring for those with learning dficulties.According to Mr Weatherston, in the Borders the learning dficulty service has had contact with  people with learning dficulties since the start of the pandemic.However, he added that the service is ldquonot involved with everyone with a learning dficulty, meaning there are ldquolikely to be people in

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle.

Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The one thing we are not short of in Kintyre is cereal straw and once you#re set up, the biggest cost to growing mushrooms is boiling the kettle a few times.#My dad used to grow them and foraging for mushrooms was a regular thing for us. However, it#s vital you forage with an expertyou intend to eat them, as several ieties are poisonous.#In nature, mycelium connects all the elements of a forest and, with people having to isolate during the pandemic, I thought a shared interest could connect people again # we could take the form of metaphorical mycelium!#Ian approached Glenn Appleton from The Community Bureau charity and, between them, they created and gave away more than  grow-your-own mushroom bags.#When the pandemic is behind us, we are going to organise many more mushroom-related activities, from nature walks to art classes # the world is our oyster,# said Glenn, who is the charity#s chief executive officer and likes a pun. #If you come into our charity shop at  Longrow South, one word of warning: Ian will talk to you for hours about fungi and is being sent hundreds of mushroom photos that people take on their walks.#Katrina MacDonald was just one recipient of a grow-your-own bag, though for her, the medicinal properties of mushrooms were to become her main focus.#My dog Rogan was diagnosed with cancer and has been undertaking an intensive course of chemotherapy,# she explained. #The financial costs are so high, but as any dog-lover knows, a dog is family and worth every single penny.#After the chemotherapy, strengthening Rogan#s immune system is paramount and it appears extract of turkey tail mushroom may help him. I started a blog about Rogan#s journey and hopeful road to recovery and now he#s becoming a local hero with people stopping me in the street and asking about him.#Now comes the figurative mycelium part. After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since. When he askedI could make Rogan a tincture, I was only too happy to help.#I came to Campbeltown  years ago and the people made me so welcome and since my we and I have been shielding, people have been as good as ever. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to provide some small help to Rogan.#People being connected and helping each another seems so apt.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson.

Take time to remember your pets as well. Cats and dogs love to see the bright lights and decorations. Kittens are particularly adept at scaling Christmas trees and pulling down tinsel. Pups love to tear at wrapping, so beware of your presents.Please be aware that there are some everyday substances which are probably more likely to be around at this time of year that can be extremely toxic to your pet. Every year at Dunedin Vets, we treat many pets which have been inadvertently poisoned and see some very distressed owners who feel so upset that they were unaware of the hazardous substance.ChocolateMost owners are aware that chocolate is toxic to pets and chocolate poisoning in dogs is the most common poisoning we see. Dogs are more likely to be involved than cats, who are less likely to eat chocolate, as its flavour is less appealing to them. Be aware, though, of some gourmet chocolates with sea salt which are attractive to cats.Chocolate contains a powerful stimulant called theobromine. This is a similar substance to caffeine. Just as caffeine is a stimulant, causing your heart to race and beat strongly, theobromine causes this to a much greater degree.The first signs that your dog has chocolate poisoningare vomiting and diarrhoea. If this occurs, they will probably feel much better and recover and not go on to suffer the full effects of the theobromine. If the dog digests the chocolate then the more serious signs occur. These include hyperactivity, high temperature and blood pressure, a fast heart rate and heartbeat irregularities. Some of these signs can occur within a few minutes of your dog devouring the chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the greater the concentration of theobromine and therefore the more rapid the onset of serious signs. Remember that chocolate cake and chocolate sweets are harmful, too, not just bars of chocolate. If you know your pet has eaten chocolate, contact your vet immediately.Vine fruits Fresh grapes and their dried ieties are toxic to pets even in small quantities. During the festive period, think about all the places where these fruits can be found: in the Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, mincemeat pies and black bun. The cooking process does not reduce the chance of poisoning.These fruits can initially cause gastro-intestinal upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea. However,the grapes are digested then a toxin enters the body which can cause kidney failure. This is likely to occur a few days after the initial ingestion of the food. Your pet is likely to be quiet and lethargic. They may be unwilling to eat. They may be drinking lots or not drinking at all.If you suspect your pet has eaten grapes or similar and is showing any of these signs then take them to your vet immediately. Your pet is likely to be given intravenous fluids and have a blood sample taken to check how their kidneys are working. It is likely that your pet will need to be hospitalised for a few days on fluids and given supportive treatment to help the kidneys. Regular blood samples will be taken to ensure the kidneyis improving.Holly, ivy and mistletoeHolly, ivy and mistletoe are often found in Christmas decorations and wreaths, and are all toxic to our pets.Holly ingestion can cause vomiting but,digested and the poisons absorbed into the body, nerve problems can occur. These can include loss of balance and wobbliness, tremors and even fits and seizures.The whole of the ivy plant is toxiceaten but the leaves and berries are particularly toxic.A species commonly poisoned by ivy is the rabbit. They seem especially attracted to its leaves. Initially, the rabbit may show signs of lethargy, diarrhoea and reluctance to eat. As the toxins are absorbed into the body, neurological problems such as twitching, collapse, fitting and paralysis can occur.Mistletoe berries are toxic. The juice of the berries is an irritant and can cause sores and ulcers in the mouth. If the berries are swallowed and the toxin absorbed, seizures and death can occur. Only a few berries are enough to be lethal for a puppy.If you see your pet eating any of these plants, remove any traces from the mouth. Try to make your pet drink, especially in the case of mistletoe. Take your pet to your vet as soon as possible. Your pet is likely to be admitted for intravenous fluids and medication to stop seizures,this stage has been reached.These plants are extremely toxic and, evenrelatively small quantities are eaten, they are iniably fatal.Onions, garlic, etcOnions and other members of the allium family can be toxic to your pets. The alliums contain the chemical disulphide, which damages the red blood cells in domestic animals. Toxicity can occur by ingesting a lot of onion at once or taking in a small quantity over a period of time. Two slices of onion eaten every week by a dog can result in toxicity after a few months. Dogs like cooked onions so be aware of thisyou have prepared caramelised onions or similar.The toxic chemical causes red blood cells to break up, resulting in anaemia and an inability to carry oxygen around the body.Signs that your pet may have onion poisoning include weakness, depression and lethargy. They may be panting and breathless. They may have pale gums and a weak pulse, or collapse.Please contact your vet immediatelyyou suspect your pet has eaten onions.Your vet will blood sample your pet to check the degree and extent of the anaemia and red blood cell damage. Your pet will be given intravenous fluids and may even require a blood transfusion.Most cases of onion poisoning recover but intensive veterinary care and treatment is required.Macadamia nutsNuts of any type are a potential choking hazard for small animals. Macadamia nuts are just the right size for causing blockages in cats. They are also toxic to both cats and dogs. Within a few hours of ingesting the nuts, lethargy, vomiting and an increase in body temperature can occur. This can progress as the nut toxin affects dferent organs of the body. There may be neurological signs, with weakness, wobbliness or tremors. There may be lameness and stf joints. Eventually, the animal may collapse.Again, contact your vetyou know your pet has ingested a macadamia nut. They will require supportive treatment and monitoring and hopefully will recover.In cats, where the nut has caused an obstruction, surgery may be required to remove the offending item from the intestines."},{"url":null,"title":"preston-lodge-high-school-supporting-need-christmas","story":"One of the appeals has seen the school organise its annual lsquoreverse Advent calendarrsquo.Typically,

A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"five-things-stairways-heaven","story":"Whaligoe Steps, CaithnessIt was women who used to do most of the hard work of lugging creels up and down the clf-side zig-zag of between  and  steps to the Whaligoe Haven, Scotlandrsquos least accessible harbour.

A gt from John Lennon to the workers of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, who were waging a work-in.Jimmy Reid had made his impromptu speech the week before. You know the one. The speech that sent a current through the crowd: ldquoWe are taking over these yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men, or any group of men can take decisions that affect our livelihoods with impunity.Forty years ago tomorrow John Lennon was killed in New York. But therersquos another link between Lennon and Jimmy Reid. An unknown one.While transcribing hours of recordings with Jimmy for a planned book, that link resurfaced last week. Irsquod worked with him on his magazine, Seven Days, in June . Later that year we got down to work on a full-scale autobiography. The interviews flourished into fascinating reflections from a man whorsquod walked with history.Viewers of the documentary Imagine will recall an encounter between Lennon and American cartoonist Al Capp. It occurred during the bed-in for peace with Yoko Ono in . Capprsquos visit wasnrsquot exactly an exercise in solidarity. In fact, the ldquodebate made the Ali-Frazer fight look like a warm bath. If Capp considered the bed-in a plaything of self-publicists he wasnrsquot above playing to the camera himself. Intermittently witty, he swerves from theatrical snarls to ungallant slurs against Yoko. Lennon responded in kind.Jimmy Reidrsquos own encounter with Capp, at the American Embassy in November , was part of a World in Action special on Nixonrsquos re-election. Jimmy had admired his Lirsquol Abner cartoon strip as a kid. This was because as a young illustrator Capprsquos strip extolled the virtues of the New Deal. His targets  Wall Street wheeler dealers, robber barons, and Tammany Hall politicos.Now, however, Capp approached him wearing a Nixon badge. A sight so incongruous Jimmy mustrsquove wonderedreality-altering fumes were pouring out of the embassyrsquos wallpaper. Jimmyrsquos reputation preceded him. Chomping a cigar Capp railed against him for ldquoDestroying the England of Nelson and Churchill. A lively debate ensued. But in style and manner it was very dferent from the Lennon altercation.Lennon, after his heavyweight bout, referred to his fellow-combatant as ldquoAl Crapp, and, therersquos a theory his song When Yoursquore Crippled Inside was written about Capp, who was fitted with a prosthetic leg after a childhood accident. An example of Lennon nursing his wrath to keep it warm Jimmy, with his customary grace, sought common ground with Capp. Although hersquod recast himself as the scourge of student protests back home, Jimmy recognised Capp as a man whorsquod marched with Martin Luther King. Perhaps his volte face wasnrsquot so much ideological as generational. A desperate defence of a past long since vanished. Capp had grown up in the s, and struggled to understand a changing society, particularly on the campuses of the s and s.Although Jimmy believed the day the music died was when Count Basie vacated the hit parade, he never stopped encouraging young people to ldquostorm the heavens. His altruism recognised that change wasnrsquot only inevitable but desirable. Embracing the new helped build a Jerusalem here on Earth. Not utopia, but a society where human potential flourished.The Jimmy Reid I knew personied a joyous humanity. His kindness and decency werenrsquot a ploy to win public approval, but formed the core of his character.Imagine that became a trend Brian McGeachan is an author and playwright"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The loss of BiFab is a national humiliation","story":"BiFab should have had just the right skills and know-how to move into the renewable energy age by building turbine jackets for the wind farms that are bristling around Scotlands coast. But it was not to be.Last week, the Scottish Government effectively signed BiFabs death warrant. This in the very week that Boris Johnson announced a dramatic further increase in targets for the reduction of UK emissions, most of which will be achieved through offshore wind.:Over poundm of taxpayers money face being lost as ministers rule out nationalisation of collapsed BiFabSo much for the green jobs revolution. Scotlands major hope for getting a poundbn slice of the renewable energy action has gone south.This is a major political scandal, and rightly condemned by a vote of the Scottish Parliament last week. BiFab has not one but two major windfarms on its very Fe doorstep: the Seagreen array off Angus and Neart na Goailthe . These poundbn projects together had contracts out for at least  full Methil jackets.It beggars belief that BiFab was unable to get any of this work, despite a poundm bung to its Canadian owners JV Driver.Instead, the French state-owned energy giant, EDF, will build them mostly in Asian yards and have them dragged , miles by diesel tugs.A jaunty-sounding Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Economy Secretary, told Good Morning Scotland that her hands were tied by Brussels competition rules. Too bad. Lessons to be learned etc.. But arent we supposed to be leaving the EU  Why would they have any say in the matter It would be ldquonaive, she replied, to believe that these state aid restrictions will not continue in some form. Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia. But it beggars belief that Scotland couldnt secure some guarantees from EDF that local, sustainable industry should be part of the supply chain. The Scottish Government has many planning powers and licenses these mega windfarms in the first place.Every year Nicola Sturgeon makes inflated promises abut a green jobs revolution. But delivery has been pretty dismal in the decade since ministers first started spouting this boosterist greenwash. As The Herald reported earlier this year, of the , direct green jobs promised back in , only , have actually materialised.We are now told therell be , new jobs in the great green rebuild. But where are they coming from  We may have % of Europes wind energy but it is being exploited by foreign state-owned companies, like EDF, employing workers in China, UAE, Indonesia ndash anywhere but Scotland. If the Scotland is incapable of exploiting our own environmental assets then people are going to ask: what is the point of leaving the UK What happened to the tidal power revolution in the Pentland Firth  That was what Alex Salmond was actually referring to when he first coined the phrase ldquoSaudi Arabia of Renewables ten years ago. The original Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage project was going to use old mine shafts to sequester carbon dioxide. That was axed in  by the UK Government.Then there was Pelamis, which developed the first commercial wave power machine at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. Gone. The UKs only wind turbine tower manufacturer, CS Wind in Campbeltown, effectively shut up shop in August.Few are aware that Scotland had one of Europes leading environmental bus manufacturers in Alexander Dennis in Falkirk ndash but not for much longer. The Scottish Government is very good at making bold pronouncements about net zero and banning petrol and diesel cars. But words are cheap.Where is the network of charging points for electric vehicles  What about replacing dirty diesel busses and trucks  Alexander Dennis designed clean hydrogen and electric buses, but has just axed  jobs.It rather looks asthe green jobs revolution is going to amount to more dodgy home insulation schemes, some trees, and a forest of green lobbyists surrounding shiny-bottom bureaucrats at interminable conferences on COP.We hear pious lectures from ministers about how we should be cycling and not using cars, while they travel around in their ministerial Lexuses. Local governments like Edinburgh are doing their best to reduce car journeys in the city through a campaign of permanent roadworks and guerilla pedestrianisation.Yet, bus travel has been declining fast, down % over the last  years, and that was before Covid. Until the pandemic, cycling was also in decline over the same period.Where is the smart public transport system with through ticketing and computerised, integrated rail and bus services  The only signicant urban transport investment recently was the ruinously expensive Edinburgh tram taking ldquohigh value folk from Princes Street to Edinburgh Airport.The Scottish Government will say that Scotland isnt an industrial powerhouse like America or China or UAE and cant just conjure dynamic world-beating industries out of thin air. Butthe nationalists cant deliver an industrial strategy that moves Scotland into the green age then their promises about an independent future may lack credibility.

What from the past is unimaginable to us today  Indeed,we canrsquot begin to imagine it, can we even answer that question Much is made of the lack of washing ndash bedsheets could be used for a year at a time ndash but stenches of this kind are not beyond our ken. It could be that something as seemingly uninteresting as the render or paint used on houses gave off an odour nobody noticed. I was certainly aware, after our house was whitewashed, of a chemical tang when it rained.Every morning, when I open the shutters in one of the oldest rooms in the cottage, therersquos a whf of coal dust, although the old fireplace is long ripped out, and we only burn wood.

Train me up, and I could be sent out to rootle for the prize truffles said to lurk in parts of the Borders, though nobody is saying where.When I was growing up in the village of Belhaven, it was the yeastiness from the brewery that alerted us to lunchtime. By midday, on the mile-long walk home from primary school, the hops grew stronger the nearer to home I got. That aroma is my madeleine, and one of the many reasons why I love Edinburgh. When Irsquom at Haymarket, as the brewersrsquo vats start to boil my childhood often floods back.Hooletrsquos answer to Chanel No. is woodsmoke. We first visited in November, when chimneys were puffing, reminiscent of Italian hill villages, where the air in winter is always woody and sweet. Sometimes therersquos a hint of coal too, and whenever I walk past our oil tank while our heating is on, an angelrsquos share escapes into the air.Horses go through the village almost every day, and provide not only excellent fertiliser but leave a far more pleasant scent in their wake than cars. My grandmother used to run out with a shovel after riders had passed, spreading the golden muck on her flowerbeds. For those of us hereabouts who are keen on manure, stables put out sackfuls by the roadside for anyone to lt. They weigh a ton. And while I know I ought to pounce on the stuff the sheep leave behind at the back gate, it is one thing to like the smell of sheep, quite another to scrape it up.Wet dog is another of the villagersquos finest scents, its Eau Sauvage. Even closely shorn terriers carry a reminder of pungent earth, while those with shaggy undercarriages can double their weight on a three-mile walk. Few things, however, compare with the nuttiness of beech leaves in the forest. Almost all the trees are bare now, and copper drts lie knee-deep in places, blotting up the worst of the mud like bread dipped in gravy. Last weekend we watched four horses cross our path, their heat creating a halo of fog around them as they disappeared into the cooling dusk.The other afternoon we began to build a leaf mould box from planks of pine.

I spent the next day tipping in leaves, some newly raked, others, from earlier in the autumn, soddenas the bed of an ancient lake, as Ted Hughes might have it.Already December has brought cold air that makes me snf, from the river, the trees, and the cloudless sky.

Shortly after the Prime Ministerrsquos recently announcement of future commitment to huge new offshore wind generation, National Grid, ESOrsquos owners, issued two Electricity Margin Notices appealing for more power. Hence we restarted coal. ESO Director Fintan Slye commented that it was now ldquoway more complex to keep the UK lights on and that the Grid had anticipated wind farm output of % of installed capacity at this time of year. Actual output was lower. Sustained wind output of under % of demand was experienced.National Grid is also facing a pound. million fine from Ofgem as a result of ldquopoor quality of its electricity networks business plan and a further pound.m fine in respect of its gas networks plan reported recently in the technical press.Ofgem also observed that these fines would have aggregated around poundm had it not recently applied a cap.SSErsquos Scottish Hydro Electricity Transmission is also reportedly facing Ofgem fines.We should question whether this money would be better directed at trying to properly engineer and fund UK Grid modelling and future system planning whilst addressing net zero challenges, offsetting what we, the consumer, are invoiced annually by National Grid to fund its investment plans. Ofgem, curiously, had proposed halving said investment.Without really serious and focused engineering by all we remain unlikely to signicantly approach the UK net zero objective and internecine warring is not helping.And this at the height of a pandemic.DB Watson, Cumbernauld."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-gets-first-scotland-work","story":"It is the largest-scale immunisation programme in the UKs history and comes as a much-needed boost amid the festive period.Here is everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in Scotland:Good news - yes.

It was Chekhov who is said to have maintained that a pistol hanging on the wall in act one should be fired at the end of act three sound advice for plays and short stories, no doubt, but a distinctly alarming prospect in real le.Chekhovrsquos point, however, was about eradicating the unnecessary. If only, in the real world, we could go back to act one and decide that certain bits of the storyrsquos set-up wonrsquot fit in with the happy ending we now have in mind, and tinker around with the original conditions.Alas, most things just drt along endlessly without a plot. But the talks between the UK and EU over our relationship after the transition period really will have a conclusion ndash though probably more like the end of a story arc in a never-ending soap opera than Charlton Heston spotting the half-buried Statue of Liberty.Hundreds of thousands of things will have to be hammered out or altered in the future, evensome sort of deal is announced this week. The same is true of the dramas in storeone isnrsquot reached. Itrsquos a real deadline nonetheless, and whatever happens, by next week people will be constructing all sorts of competing narratives to account for it.The UK Government will paint it as a triumph, naturally, or at least a plucky victory in the face of overwhelming adversity, whatever it is. If therersquos anything that could be, however implausibly, described as a deal, so will the EU. Everyone  will call it a cataclysm, a recipe for disaster, the worst of all possible worlds.Yet whatever story we tell about the point wersquove now reached, it will not follow on from any of the narratives we were expecting ndash like everything  that has happened since David Cameron decided he had no option but to offer a referendum. Itrsquos hard even to remember that itrsquos almost exactly a year since Boris Johnson won the election handsomely on a promise to ldquoget Brexit done.And while he has, after a fashion, it is clearly nothing like what was promised by the Leave side during the campaign ndash easiest deal ever, etc. Nor, however, has whatrsquos followed been much like what the Remain side predicted, either. There may have been meltdown, but it wasnrsquot Brexit that caused it.One big dference is that the tale of the UK and the EU is now almost exactly like any other foreign policy story. Everything is about the nitty-gritty of trade-offs : the economy, reciprocal rights, visa requirements and other boring stuff that comes up in the UKrsquos deals with Japan, Canada, New Zealand or anywhere . The great, mythic story of the EU and its manest destiny has been entirely forgotten. When was the last time you heard anybody talking about the ldquoinisibility of EU rulesor the inevitability of ldquoever greater union A few days ago, Peter Mandelson made the extraordinary admission that much of the responsibility for Britain being out of the EU on much harder terms than either side predicted lay with Remainers who tried to overturn the referendum result . Even Tony Blair has conceded that Brexit as a political argument ndashnot the wrangling about what happens afterwards ndash is over.The great pity of all this is that the option for which both arch-Europhiles and, judging by what they said back then, the leaders of the Leave campaign would probably have settled ndash something like EEA or Efta membership ndash is now a dead duck.Well, thatrsquos how the story turned out, evenit is clumsy scriptwriting ndash something we can blame not just on Lord Mandelson, but Theresa Mayrsquos moronic ldquored lines and the constantly changing demands of those, like Nigel Farage, for whom no Brexit would ever be hard enough. It may have been an unwelcome twist, but it wasnrsquot one that could be wished away or revised. Think of it as a bit like the moment in From Dusk Till Dawn when a fairly realistic crime film suddenly turns, with no warning at all, into a camp, blood-soaked vampire movie.As far as both sides of the English Channel are concerned, tidying up Brexit is now just one more thing on the list. Itrsquos not even all that firmly at the top of the list. The overwhelming reason for that is the Covid emergency.The apocalyptic warnings of Remainers about economic catastrophe now look pretty flimsy, since both the UK and EU are in the midst of much worse anyway. Covid has cost hundreds of times more than the worst predictions of Brexitrsquos impact. It may even concentrate both sides on finding mutually workable solutions, rather than preserving their own positions above all.The EU is more worried about keeping Poland and Hungary in line, and securing agreement on how much its southern members should pay towards dealing with coronavirus, than it is about the UKrsquos departure. The UK has spent so much that a total reconstruction of the economy is not just an aspiration, but a necessity. The issues in any EU deal are now aspects of domestic ones ndash restructuring, securing enough foreign workers, trying to maintain the Union, increasing trade and productivity ndash rather than the other way round.Most of us still hope for some kind of deal but itrsquos not now a question of no deal being better than a bad deal. Itrsquos that neither a bad deal or no deal seems like nearly as big a deal as it did this time last year."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12115695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"like-ebenezer-scrooge---australian-newspaper-called-first-ministers-response-royals-flouting-travel-ban","story":"A row erupted yesterday after the royals decided to come to Scotlanddespite warnings fromthe Scottish Government about the strict rules over crossing the Border.The First Minister on Monday said the Scottish Government knew the couple wanted to come by Royal Train as part of a nationwide tour thanking workers on the coronavirus frontline.She refused to endorse the visit amidst a row that it broke Covid rules and said the Government ldquomade sure the royals were aware ldquoof the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit.Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gethingcriticised William and Kates decision to travel to Wales as Covid cases rise, saying he would prefer itldquono-one was having unnecessary visitsMr Gething said he was not ldquoparticularly bothered or interested when asked during by BBC Radio rsquos Today programmehe thought the couple should still travel to Wales.But he said William and Katersquos visit, part of a national tour by royal train, should not be used by people as an ldquoexcuse to say they are ldquoconfused about coronavirus regulations.:Nicola Sturgeon says Royal household reminded of travel ban before William and Kate visitThe Australian, the only daily newspaper distributed nationally, whose editorial line has been described as centre-right, had a dferent interpretation of the events in reporting the row, describing the royals \"hearty dispensation of goodwill was interrupted by a bah-humbug\" from Nicola Sturgeon.It went on: \"In tones rivalling those of Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Carol, Ms Sturgeon curtly reminded Prince William and Kate there were currently restrictions in place to try and control the spread of coronavirus, restricting travel in Scotland except for work purposes.\"Crossing the Scottish border was made illegal from the end of November and anyone caught entering or leaving Scotland without a reasonable excuse could be slapped with a pound fine.There are exceptions, including travel for work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, but only when this cannot be done from home.Royal sources said the trip was permitted under the work purposes exemption.The Royals arrived in Edinburgh on Monday morning to the sound of bagpipes serenading them with Christmas songs, before meeting workers at a Scottish Ambulance Service hub.The pair are attempting to spread festive cheer to frontline workers ahead of the Christmas holidays on their -hour train tour.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science.

She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group.

The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year.. The group are inviting people to give feedback by th Decemberpossible."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CLLR-JOHN-GORDON-STORR-1.jpg","title":"making the case for targeted investment in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineConsulting community planning partners on the specic projects that should be included in the plan started last week, and the members of the Eilean a’ Cheo ward were keen to hear the views of voters in the next stage in the process due to take place in January. As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3514204.jpg--.jpg?1607091783000\n","title":"covid 19 vaccinations arrive in northern ireland","story":"Robin Swann has confirmed that the first batch of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine has arrived into Northern Ireland.The initial consignment of almost , doses paves the way for vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.Welcoming the arrival, the Health Minister said: “We have been anticipating this news for many months and it is hugely welcome to receive the first batch of the vaccine today.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3517048.jpg--.jpg?1607350157000\n","title":"work plan for cullybackey level crossing","story":"Translink, alongside our contractor Babcock, will be carrying out essential maintenance and resurfacing work at Cullybackey North level crossing as part of a wider programme of service enhancements at level crossings across the network.This work is essential in order to maintain the safety, reliability and resilience of the crossing and the new surface will also help reduce noise from traffic as it passes across it.This work will take place overnight on Wednesday th December.

The initial phase of the roll-out of the vaccination programme began today. The programme represents an unprecedented logistical exercise that will take many months to complete. Progress will depend on available supply across the UK and is dependent on production and delivery schedules. The timescale for the approval of further vaccines will be an important factor in the wider roll-out of the programme.The process of determining clinical prioritisation is being closely guided by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationadvice.Early deployment in Northern Ireland has three central aims: To protect vulnerable patients and residents at higher risk of severe disease and mortality. To protect staff working in high risk areas for exposure To protect staff members at highest personal risk of morbidity and mortality.The exact timing of all plans will be subject to vaccine availability.The focus in the coming weeks will therefore include care home residents and staffhealth and social care staff working with patient groups at higher riskstaff working in higher risk settings staff who are themselves at increased personal risk due to being in extremely vulnerable high risk categories or having other defined clinical risk factors.In advance of the GP element of the programme starting, active consideration is being given to options for extending the programme to begin vaccinating over s in the community.A Departmental letter setting out the early deployment framework for the vaccine has been issued to Trusts.Seven Trust vaccination centres are being established for the staff vaccination process. The locations are: Belfast Trust – Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast South Eastern Trust – Ulster Hospital, Dundonald Southern Trust – South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon Northern Trust – Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena Western Trust - Foyle Arena, Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre, Omagh and Lakeside Leisure Centre, Enniskillen.Mobile vaccination teams operating from Trust centres will take the vaccine to residents and staff in care homes across Northern Ireland.Trust staff are working closely with care homes to ensure that arrangements are as safe and effective as possible.HSC Trusts will inform their staff who are in the early deployment groups and encourage them to book their vaccinations through a digital booking .Anyone who is pregnant or breast feeding, or who is planning to get pregnant in the next three months, is not advised to get the vaccine.The full roll-out of the vaccine is scheduled to continue until the summer of . Further population groups will be added to the programme on a phased basis, with priority given to age and other clinical vulnerability factors.Subject to the availability of a suitable vaccine, it is intended from early January  to expand roll-out of the programme through primary care led vaccination clinics.

Reflecting on their delayed wedding plans, Lauren, who is a professional wedding photographer, explained that the original idea was to reschedule their wedding for April  - but her diary quickly filled up with other couples reorganising their own weddings.We also said to ourselves, #What are we waiting for, we just want to get married#, so we decided to stick with a date in November that we had arranged when the original day was cancelled, she said.A stressful few months later and amid restrictions changing regularly, the couple eventually got their big day last week.Much to Jason#s surprise and delight, four fully kitted out leboat crew members representing the station, were waiting outside the Arcadia in Portrush following the ceremony to provide a socially distanced guard of honour to wish the couple well.We could only have  guests along with Jason, myself and our two children but we were able to set up a live stream that allowed everybody  who should have been there to watch, Lauren said. Everyone went to such efforts in getting dressed up for the occasion and to join us in the wedding virtually.She continued: When it was over, we went for takeaway coffee and sat on the harbour overlooking the leboat station. Then we went home, had a takeaway and had our first dance in the kitchen.With her husband on the leboat crew in Portrush, Lauren knows all too well how important it is for volunteers to have the right lesaving kit and personal protection equipment.I am very proud that Jason is a volunteer but I do also worry when the pager beeps and he is called out to save others who are in trouble, she said. There is always such a sense of relief when he helps to bring those in dficulty back to safety but also when he s home safely himself.From the moment I met Jason, the RNLI pager became a part of my le too. The leboat has always been in Jason#s blood and he comes from a long family line who have been involved in helping to save lives at sea for generations.Lauren urged people to donate to the RNLI#s Christmas appeal, while Jason added that any donation would make a huge dference to the charity as it provides lesaving services.The best Christmas gt RNLI volunteers like me can wish for is a kind donation to our Christmas appeal, he said.

Additionally, the number of people who are trialled or being trialled are comparable to a regular vaccine efficacy trial. Therefore, no corner has been cut on testing, evaluation and determining safety of the Covid- vaccine. The vaccine causes infertility autism etc.Most of vaccine-related side effects or complications are short-lived and appear within days of vaccination. The side-effects of Pfizer#s mRNA vaccine are mild and include fatigueand headachesafter the second dose. During the Pfizer vaccine trials in thousands of volunteers, no long-term disabilities such as infertility or autism were reported.The vaccine will give you Covid-.Most of the promising vaccine candidates including Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines only use a portion of the SARS-CoV- virus which by itself can#t cause disease. Therefore, none of the approved vaccines can give disease in vaccinated people. Instead, these vaccines protect people from getting severely sick who could otherwise end up in hospital or ICUs.I get my flu jab - I don#t need a Covid  vaccination as well.The flu jab can#t protect people from Covid- infection. Therefore, to safeguard from both diseases, two vaccines - each specically designed for flu and Covid- - are required. The flu jab is even more important this season due to possible increase in Covid- infection after the festive season in January and February. The vaccine is unsuitable for those with weakened immune systems or existing conditions.There are dferent kind of vaccines to do the same job - protection from infections. Some of these vaccines, particularly live attenuated vaccinesmay not be suitable for people how are on immune-suppressive drugs, chemotherapy or have immune compromising conditions. However, the currently rolled out Pfizer BioNtech vaccine is based on mRNA technology and can safely be applied in these vulnerable communities. The vaccine contains a microchip to track those who get it.This is a myth and there is no scientic backing to this misinformation. All vaccines carry genetic instruction of the virus so that these components of the virus can be presented to our immune system to establish immunity. After this immunity is established, the person is no longer susceptible to the virus and therefore will be safeguarded from severe form of the infection. These genetic instructions are only short-livedand thereafter these are removed through our body#s clearing mechanisms within days. Importantly, the virus genetic instructions in the vaccines are delivered to our cell cytoplasm whereas our DNA is in the nucleus. Therefore, integration of the vaccine encoded instructions can#t reach to nucleus and thus can#t permanently integrate to be tracked. The Pfizer vaccine is based on mRNA technology and RNA can#t be microchipped to DNA as these are not compatible. The vaccine will be used to control people through G cell phone towers.The vaccine contains components of the viruses to train our immune system and these molecules are only controlled by our body cellular and metabolic machinery. Therefore, G mobile phone signals can#t transmit the virus or reduce our defences to attract viruses.The mooted travel and hospitality passports are designed for the government to police people#s behaviour.We are dealing with a deadly virus that has killed more people in a single year than HIV, flu, Ebola did. Therefore, it is a personal, moral and administrative responsibility to ensure at least % coverage of the vaccine so that herd immunity through vaccination is achieved to break the transmission chain of the SARS-CoV-.If everyone  gets the vaccine, I don#t need to.With a % effective vaccine, we need to immunize  out of every  people in a population. This means there will be people within the community who can#t be vaccinated due to their medical complications. This poses a societal responsibility for everyone to take part in vaccination campaign. Herd immunity is a better solution. It would be better to get Covid-.Herd immunity is an established and probably ultimate solution getting out of Covid- pandemic. The question lies how we would achieve herd immunity - either through natural course of infection or through vaccination. In the former case, we will lose signicant lives, people will develop long Covid, and this expensive way of immunity might last only for a year which means the whole process needs to be started again multiple times. The vaccine-induced herd immunity is the safe, plausible and legitimate way out of this crisis. This vaccine has been rolled out too fast.It is true that the timeline for the Covid- vaccine from concept to reality has been in a short one-year time. However, this squeeze in time has been due to re-purposed technologies, cutting short administration, availability of funds and willingness of people to participate in clinical trials. Additionally, the number of people who have been trialled in safety and efficacy studies are comparable to participants in regular vaccine assessment process. Therefore, approval from regulatory bodies is an assurance for its safety and effectiveness. Why is there a vaccine for a disease with such a high survival rate The vast majority of people infected will survive and many will not even notice the clinical signs . However, people who are infected asymptomatically may pass the infection to people with underlying conditions. Finally, while we have learned a signicant number of facts about the virus, there are still fundamental questions that need illustration. For example, people developing #long covid# may become a norm in the long-term, necessitating the importance of vaccines to break the community spread of the virus.

She would have given you the last penny in her purse. She would have loved putting on a big hat and playing Lady Bountul all over the place, and she’d have had the money given away faster than me.”Frances added: “For the anniversary of my mum’s death I was running a knitting company and I made packs of blankets and hats and jumpers for the premature baby unit. I’ve never turned my back where there was a need I came across my entire le.”To date, the Co Down lottery winner, who was speaking publicly for the first time, said they have given away half of their fortune to others in the biggest ever Lottery giveaway, helping “thousands” of people, with Frances having lost count of “the number of times I’ve cried my eyes out” following a recipient’s response to her generosity.Frances dismissed suggestions that new found wealth could be as much a burden as a blessing.“This is just love and joy on a permanent basis,” she said.“How could this be a burden  It’s just like winning the lottery every day.”Yet, Frances, who suffers from a medical condition that has her destined for a wheelchair, is also all too aware that fabulous wealth can’t buy you everything.“My auntie told me I had Perthes’ disease as a kid,” she revealed.“When I was a baby I had a big metal frame around my hips my dad used to be able to pick me up with the back of the frame.“I just managed. I’ve always done plenty of sport but about  years ago my cruciate ligament went and all of a sudden the joints went so my mobility is really poor.”She told how she spent years “sitting on a chair, unable to go anywhere or do anything”.“I actually spent about three years in Northern Ireland sitting on a chair because I couldn’t really go anywhere or do anything,” she confided.“I had an operation the year before we won the lottery and it has got me back on my feet again for a bit but I will eventually not be able to walk so I’m preparing for that.”But Frances told the Belfastthat it’s not something that scares her at all.The mother of three daughters — Katrinaand twins Natalie and Fiona— added: “What can you do about it  You just have to get on with it.”She also revealed to this newspaper that her health condition was a factor in her choice of home. Although she had her heart set on a bungalow, estate agents insisted on showing her a castle and a -bed stately home which came with an entire village “somewhere in the north east” of England.But she’s perfectly happy in her current abode — “a five bedroom, brick-built house with good sized rooms and a couple of acres of garden” which she “found on the internet”.The Connollys’ generosity was especially appreciated during the ongoing pandemic.In Northern Ireland, the couple bought new sewing machines for charity workers who were making PPE during Covid, as well as sending food parcels to many sheltering alone.The pair also paid for hundreds of elderly patients in nursing homes to have iPads to Facetime their families — including Frances’ great aunt Sheila Graham — and for young carers to be able to learn from home.“Sheila’s home in Omagh was one of the ones that got tables to keep people from being isolated she was able to talk to my -year-old father Frank in Essex over Skype,” Frances said.Being filthy rich does, however, take some managing.“I get up at am so I can answer all the messages and emails people have sent me before I start a day’s work,” she said.“Then Paddy gets up and makes me my breakfast.”When asked what a multi-millionaire has for breakfast she replied: “Pancakes and pineapple juice this morning...”Frances, now based in Hartlepool, spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland in the pre-Covid days, and admitted that she always has got a buzz out of helping others.The businesswoman added that she has “been doing voluntary work since I was nine”.“Obviously I’m able to do it now on a much bigger scale and the buzz is bigger because you’re actually making a massive dference,” she said.Apart from splashing out on “some nice bits of jewellery” and “more clothes than I need” Frances admitted that she still looks for bargains.One of her most recent purchases was  bottles of Bollinger champagne for people working on the front line.“Patrick and I watched a programme on Monaco recently, and somebody spent £, on a single bottle of champagne,” Frances, who doesn’t drink alcohol, said.“I found a special offer on champagne for £ a bottle, and I’m saving them to hand out to people who deserve some gratitude.”In the meantime, her plans for  include doing a PhD in clinical psychology — and writing a book about her good fortune.Frances said that while money hasn’t changed her as a person, “it does change how you live”.“We’re living in a nicer house, driving nicer cars, I can make a shopping list and, miraculously, my PA just has everything in the fridge for me and it’d be absolutely amazing,” she said.“If I want to go and stay in a hotel I can just do that but it doesn’t change who you are.“We have come into money late. If you’d come to it when you’re young, you’d maybe let it change how you live a bit more.”Belfast Most ReadArmagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Department of Health reveals vaccine roll-out plans as a further  deaths reported NI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseThe £m Moira lottery jackpot winners and what they did nextFears NI online shoppers facing #tax# on parcels crossing Irish Sea from JanuaryLatest NewsCrime group #Action Against Drugs# behind #hit list# faces call to disband Margaret CanningOpinionThis accord may be more important for le here than any Brexit free trade pactJustice Minister Naomi Long urged to progress landmark domestic abuse Bill following compromiseEx-Glentoran physio Jonathan Cummins settles his claim for unfair sackingCoronavirus: Delight as the first vaccine is administered but public is urged to stay vigilant,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

has found the Oxford Covid- vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy By Nina Massey, PA Science CorrespondentDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailOxford University’s Covid- vaccine “has a good safety record and efficacy” and could help control the pandemic, a scientist leading the study has said, as phase three data was published.Interim results from pooled studies show the vaccine was .% effective, on average, in preventing coronavirus after two doses were given.For people given two full doses of the jab in one study, the vaccine was .% effective.In a study where people received a half dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine was % effective.The overall efficacy of .% is based on , volunteers across the United Kingdom and Brazil, and combined across three groups of people vaccinated.But on a day when the NHS started rolling out the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in older people, health staff and care home workers, the Oxford researchers said more detail is required on how effective their vaccine is in older adults.This comes after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam suggested people who cannot leave their homes may need to wait for the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.Published in The Lancet, the study is the first set of Covid- vaccine data to undergo scientic peer-review.Data for the vaccine, which has been developed with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, has been submitted to the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyfor approval.Today we have published the interim analysis of the phase three trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirusProfessor Andrew PollardProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said: “Today we have published the interim analysis of the phase three trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirus.“We are hugely grateful to our trial volunteers for working with us over the past eight months to bring us to this milestone.”Writing in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers said there were no admissions to hospital or severe disease in people receiving the vaccine.However, they said more detail is needed on how effective the vaccine is in older adults – those at most risk of severe Covid-.The data in The Lancet analysis was mostly restricted to people aged  and under, with work in older age groups still ongoing.Prof Pollard said: “Twenty per cent of the people in the trials are older adults, both in the UK and in Brazil.“But they were recruited later than the younger adults so they’ve had less time for cases to accrue in those age groups and for us to be able to measure an efficacy signal.“And remember, this is an interim analysis, where the data that we have at the moment are largely from younger adults.”He added: “And so, as we do further cuts of the data, we’ll have a lot more information about the other age groups.“I think it is important that we do generate some more data in those older adults over time.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ebde .ece AUTOCROP w

Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greenhaw care centre has been the subject of a court order following an RQIA inspection on September . That required the Trust to relocate all  residents. Greenhaw is a -bed privately owned care home located on Racecourse Road which specialises in providing care to those with dementia. By October , it emerged that  residents had relocated, however, due to a Covid- outbreak the remaining  residents moved to Ward  at Waterside Hospital. Staff from the care home transferred to look after this group of residents. googletag.cmd.push Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen told Thursday’s Western Trust Board Meeting that throughout November ‘our own team in Waterside has played a fundamental role in overseeing standards of care in Ward ’. They mitigated ‘some early risks around the potential transmission of Covid’ to other parts of the hospital. Dr Kilgallen commended Ann Marie McIlmoyle who stepped in as a Ward Sister to manage Ward , and was supported by Infection Prevention and Control , estates and support services team. All  residents moved to a local care centre on December , she concluded. In March, health watchdog RQIA was made aware of a leak within Greenhaw’s plumbing system, affecting the hot water temperature and pressure to a number of bedrooms and sanitary accommodation in the home. googletag.cmd.push It was then discovered that the dangerous bacteria legionella was in the home, however, none of the residents had Legionnaires’ disease. The direction to temporarily move residents from the home came as a result of the ‘very major refurbishments’ required, according to an RQIA spokesperson. That includes the provision of sufficient handwashing facilities and reinstating water supplies to bedrooms which would make it very dficult to provide the necessary standard of care.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Bob Brown, Director of Primary Care and Older peoples services in the Western Trust,is one of the first vaccinators to be vaccinated from the Western Trust area. He said: “As the Executive Director of Nursing and given my responsibility for older people’s services, I felt it was important that I received my vaccine early so that I can become a peer vaccinator to support our team who are getting ready to deliver this vital vaccine to our fantastic health and social care staff who have worked tirelessly throughout the last ten months, and also for our care home residents and staff who have also been highly impacted by this virus. googletag.cmd.push While our thoughts continue to remain with those families who have experienced the loss of a loved one from COVID-, I would encourage all staff to avail of the vaccine as it becomes available to them, to protect themselves, their patients and their families.” The initial phase of the roll-out of the vaccination programme began today. The programme represents an unprecedented logistical exercise that will take many months to complete.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lynn, , made his championship debut in Derrys  defeat to Monaghan, after previously making his debut with a man of the match performance against Armagh in the McKenna Cup the previous season. He was the longest serving player in the Derry squad, ahead of current skipper Chrissy McKaigue and this news casts a shadow over the Greenlough mans inter-county future. Barring his cruciate injury last year, he missed just two games in all competitions for Derry in the last three seasons, the  qualier win in Waterford under Damian Barton and a league win over Wicklow under Damian McErlain two years later. googletag.cmd.push Recent speculation suggested Lynn had been dropped from the senior . Yesterday, without making any further comment, manager Rory Gallagher confirmed to the County Derry Post that the Greenlough man was no longer on the . Also, when contacted, Enda Lynn, chose not to make any comment on the matter. He is concentrating on fully getting over his knee injury that caused some concern during his clubs run to the intermediate title last season. U players Ronan McFauland former minor Iarlaith Donaghyhave attracted Gallaghers attention. They are currently following a programme under senior Strength and Conditioning coach Peter Hughes.

Wed be hopeful, but well have to take it easy with him.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Mary’s Limavady and Limavady High School have been selected as part of a UK-wide programme which was announced in October. Testing will initially be offered to all staff and students in Years ,  and  across both schools. Rapid lateral flow tests will be used for the scheme, similar to those used in the recent Liverpool pilot scheme. The tests were recently criticised in a study published in The British Medical Journal, which raised concerns that the tests missed over % of cases. googletag.cmd.push The study warned the tests may give a  sense of reassurance. However, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Track and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identy many cases of infection in people without symptoms. She told BBC Radio s Today programme that the tests were helping to diagnose tests that would otherwise go undetected. What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the diseasetheir test is negative, she said. We are trying to say [to people who test positive] You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for  days. That is a whole dferent game-changer. googletag.cmd.push We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldnt be changing our behaviours, she added. Health Minister Robin Swann thanked the two schools for their particpation in the scheme. Work is progressing with a iety of local partners and experts on New Testing Interventionsfor a range of settings including this schools’ initiative, he said. “The learning arising from the NTIswill help us to better understand how new technologies can be implemented and extended more widely across settings. It is important to be aware that these NTIs are still at an early stage of development, and consequently these new tests must be rolled out with careful planning and evaluation.     “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Limavady High School and StMary’s for their participation, and I would particularly like to thank the team in the Public Health Agency who have developed and are leading this NTI and colleagues in the Education Authority who continue to be instrumental in driving this important work forward.” Education Minister Peter Weir said the tests would cause minimum disruption to lessons. I welcome this initiative where pupils and staff, without symptoms, will be tested on a voluntary basis andI want to thank both schools for taking part, he said. The test will be supervised by trained staff and I expect there to be minimal disruption to lessons. Keeping our schools safe during the pandemic remains my top priority and I will continue to support schools in the months ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Claus was operating in partnership with local company Specialist Joinery Group, who organised the fly-by, as well as ensuring all the pupils received a Christmas treat.

The competition is part of the Revival Festival being co-ordinated by Creggan Enterprises. As part of the festival, a scavenger hunt with a twist is also being staged. There are great prizes to be won in both competitions, which are running on the Revival Festival website – www.revivalfestival.net - from now until December . The lockdown restrictions kept many of us inside during , but the two contests will now allow people to revisit, and celebrate, our cityscape and local heritage safely. The ‘Treasure Trail’, which can also be completed at home, features  city landmarks - some old, some new, and some pictured from unusual angles - and asks you to identy them. googletag.cmd.push Raacuteth Moacuter manager Kevin Hippsley encouraged young people to get involved. “A few of these landmarks are fiendishly dficult so we have included a number of clues on the website, which should help,” said Mr Hippsley. The ‘Teenage Clicks’ Photo Competition asks participants to go out into their communities and capture three great images and send them in to: competition@teenageclicks.net. Winning entries will then been displayed in an exhibition and online. “We’re looking for imagination and creativity here,’ said Mr Hippsley. “Both these events are free to enter and a great fun for all the family.” The Revival Festival is supported by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Community Festival Fund. googletag.cmd.push Other activities and materials are available from www.revivalfestival.net and www.teenageclicks.net for access or downloading.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International. It will be preceded at .pm by the Premier Junior final between Armagh and Cavan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick charity hosts presentations  ","story":"THE Le Change Changes Lives charity which helps those affected by mental ill health or addiction problems made a number of presentations to its service users last week.The Downpatrick group held a socially distanced ceremony at the St Patrick Centre, just a short distance from its Market Street base where it ed to recently after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.Eight of the charityrsquos participants were presented with their Level One ICQ certicates in hospitality skills funded by the the Asset Recovery Community Schemewhich is managed by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Certicates were awarded to Janet Smith, Natalie Mussett, Sarah Taylor, Michelle Quinn, Clare Higgins, Colm Young and Sonya Craig.One of the certicates was awarded posthumously to Marie Magee mdash who sadly died earlier this year mdash and was accepted by her husband, Mark.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility.

This again sends out the message that Mid Ulster District Council is a cold house for the Unionist minority.“It shows that their views are not taken into consideration. It is totally unacceptablethat there has been no response to my question at last month’s meeting.”Chair of the Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said directors are available online to answer questions.At this point, Council’s acting Chief Executive, Adrian McCreesh said: “The Decade of Anniversaries was taken to the development committee on October .“It was a report that was very detailed and it was a hard earned process of a lot of consultation between our officers and a lot of members from two parties in particular.“That was subsequently ratied on October  by full council.”Mr McCreesh continued: “The Decade of Anniversaries was designed and put together with a view of meeting the requirements of the funders – the Community Relations Council and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, under the principles of remembering and support.“That is what the NI celebrations will be about and that is what the funding is going to shape.”Mr McCreesh also said a community support grant will be available to all interested parties across Mid Ulster.“I stand over the fact that no paper that I, or my officers, present to Mid Ulster Council can identy one group only.“Cllr Cutherbston asked for inidual discussion with my team, he is entitled to do that and I was delighted to facilitate that.“However, now is not the time to identy the actions of one group. There is a programme within that which will go out to the public and I would imagine multiple groups will want to apply from all over the district.“I would hope and expect the group Cllr Cuthbertson refers to will also be an applicant, that is how we do our business.“My role in all of this is to ensure we are consistent in our approach, trouble arises when criteria is applied inconsistently.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said “it was a bit rich” of Cllr Cuthbertson to make this accusation.“Essentially what has been put here isCouncil does not jump to the beck and call of a certain community group it is in the wrong,” said Cllr McPeake.“I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to start going down.“We are at a very early stage in this and are going down the route of best practice, taking an educational view and taking all perspectives into account.“That is the way it should be and the way it was previously.“I just think it is a bit rich but I am not surprised coming from the same councillor.“It is absolutely hypocriticalfor a member to be castigating this council because somehow, the Council is not acting to the whim of a certain community group.”In response, Cllr Cuthbertson said he would “not take any lectures about being hypocriticalfrom a Sinn Fein member” and reiterated his stance that it is not for an officer to decide what community feedback is included in a report.“Are we saying now that ratepayers in Mid Ulster have no say in any policy coming forward. Does community feedbackmean nothing,” asked Cllr Cuthbertson.“Is it now the case any consultation this Council does is simply a paper ticking exercise as community feedback means nothing ”The Council’s Chair described this suggestion as “rubbish” and “not the experience of any other member in this council.”Maghera author signs up top scriptwriter - read hereEditor’s messageThank you for reading this article.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edcafeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfacaaaface   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
