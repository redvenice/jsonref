Pictured: Eric in top hat, tails, black shorts and black tights          These publicity stills of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, released by the BBC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the duo’s move from commercial TV to Broadcasting House, are a glowing reminder of what comedy used to be — warm, friendly and infectious          The pictures are a delightful keepsake of the rich friendship between two ridiculously talented performers, who had loyally stuck beside each other since their teens during World War II          Always in tune: Many a famous face appeared on their much-loved show, with Elton John (pictured) performing in 1976  Never shy: Eric showed off in a kilt to Derek Nimmo in this amusing still, left, while right shows the pair on set Look at the boys’ faces in that snapshot of highwayman Dick Turpin and a damsel in distress. Later in the scene, Eric is mugging astride an elaborate prop, with his leather boots sticking out at impossible right angles from his collapsed horse.But the simple joke works best: Eric has got his spectacles on over his eyemask. It’s such a daft touch, set off by that gormless smile.And there’s Little Ern, his fluffy chest and shoulders left bare by the pink ruffles of his costume.The set-up would work just as well in a sketch today, if they were playing Cap’n Poldark and Demelza.That eager moment on the sofa at their flat, hauling up their shirts for actress Ann Hamilton — today it would bring howls of anguish about ‘inappropriate behaviour’ from the joyless sentinels of the permanently offended.The truth, though, is that these two men in their late 40s were behaving as gleefully as little children, playing a game of doctors and nurses. How about that unposed moment with the trumpet, both of them on the brink of helpless laughter? It looks like a rehearsal shot, because Eric isn’t wearing a tie.Ernie, as always, not only has a tie, but cufflinks, gold watch and a breast pocket handkerchief. Eric was no trumpeter, so the instrument is a prop.And his look of triumphant happiness, mouth wide open, tells us he has just delivered a perfect ad lib, a gag that wasn’t in the script.

Above all, they never took themselves too seriously.See Eric as Sooty the bear, with puppeteer Harry Corbett, and the real Sooty perched on his shoulder. All he has to do is assume an air of hurt dignity, and it’s hilarious — Harry and Ern are both sporting broad grins. That costume must have been hot, though: Eric’s face is glistening with sweat. Anyone can see what fun they’re having. It’s one of the reasons celebrity guests clamoured to be on their shows.In the Cossack hats, there’s American singer Diane Solomon, while Australian Keith Michell is the actor joining the duo for a Foreign Legion adventure in the Sahara sands, complete with deckchair and inflatable duck.Of all these glorious images, it’s the one of them sunbathing in shorts that sums them up best. For a start, you know Ern has been subjected to constant teasing about his ‘short, fat, hairy legs’.Then there’s the hoops in the hems of Eric’s shorts, designed for waggling. The finishing touch is his footwear: office shoes polished to a high shine, and long socks hauled high by his sock suspenders.Who wears sock suspenders these days? Come to that, who else could make you laugh out loud, with nothing more than their bare knees?As Eric would say, there’s no answer to that.

To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and a betrayal of that trust.’Mr Johnson’s popularity among Tory Party members has soared since he resigned as Foreign Secretary in July in protest at Mrs May’s Chequers plan, which would see the UK agreeing to follow EU regulations on trade, the environment and social affairs. He said it left the country at risk of ‘economic vassalage’ and accused Mrs May of ‘dithering’ over the UK’s strategy.Momentum founder who propelled Jeremy Corbyn to leadership...Raab insists a Brexit deal is \u0027within our reach\u0027 after new...Share this articleMeanwhile, Mrs May’s allies say that executives working for Sir Lynton’s powerful campaign company, CTF Partners, have been in discussions to ‘put rocket boosters’ under Change Britain, a group set up to argue for a hard Brexit, and turn it into a guerilla campaign against the Chequers deal.They fear that the group will mount rallies around the country headed by Mr Johnson and other high-profile Brexiteers. Change Britain has strong links with the influential European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Mrs May’s allies believe that Sir Lynton’s outfit has been targeting Eurosceptic Tory donors to fund the campaign.They are also suspicious that Mr Jonson seems to have been ‘singing from the Lynton hymn sheet’ since his resignation – and point to the furore over Mr Johnson’s inflammatory claim that burkas make women look like ‘bank robbers’ or ‘letterboxes’. Sir Lynton, 62, is an exponent of so-called ‘dog-whistle politics’, in which controversial messages, couched in relatively inoffensive language, are targeted at the Hard-Right.          The Prime Minister (pictured in Cape Town) last night vowed not to make any compromises to the Chequers deal, nor to ‘give in’ to demands for a second referendum Sir Lynton, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his previous successes, lost some of his lustre after playing a key role in the disastrous 2017 Election campaign which led to the loss of Mrs May’s Commons majority.The row comes as MPs return to the Commons after the summer recess to prepare for a series of bruising battles over Brexit, with Mrs May hoping to strike a final deal with the EU within the next two months and then win Parliament’s approval. But she faces opposition from dozens of Tory MPs in the ERG, who share Mr Johnson’s objections to the Chequers deal.It has led to intense speculation among MPs that if Mrs May tries to force Chequers through, then the ERG would force a vote of no confidence in her. If 48 MPs make such a call, then a vote would be held, triggering a leadership contest if Mrs May lost.A source close to Mr Johnson said: ‘Boris has always backed the aims of Change Britain but he has no role in the organisation.’A spokesman for CTF said that while Sir Lynton had not personally ‘spoken with nor met anyone from Change Britain’, the company’s senior staff ‘were often consulted because of their campaign expertise and knowledge’.He added: ‘The better the deal the Prime Minister secures in Brexit, the better the prospects for the Conservatives at the next Election.’   SIMON WALTERS: Revenge of \u0027Wizard of Oz\u0027 Sir Lynton Crosby blamed for Theresa May\u0027s election humiliationThe feud between Sir Lynton Crosby and Theresa May dates back to her disastrous decision to call a snap election in June 2017.Both are said to blame each other for the fiasco.When Australian-born Crosby first heard of the snap poll from a May aide, he was in Fiji at a family gathering and his stunned response was: ‘I’m not sure that’s a smart idea, mate.’The Mail on Sunday revealed last year how he sent Mrs May a ‘killer memo’ warning her it could backfire. He said there was ‘a lot of risk’ in calling a surprise ballot: voters were desperate to ‘avoid uncertainty’– but by going to the polls, she was doing the opposite.Instead of the landslide win she expected, she could do no better than David Cameron’s narrow win in 2015, Crosby advised. In the event she did worse, and lost her Commons majority.For their part, Mrs May’s supporters said she blamed him for key campaign mistakes.They blamed Crosby for ordering her to run a presidential style ‘strong and stable’ campaign which collapsed days after the manifesto launch when she was forced to tear up plans for a so-called ‘dementia tax.’ Sir Lynton also fell out with Mrs May’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, with Timothy subsequently accusing him of failing to spot Jeremy Corbyn’s support among young voters.          Theresa May and election guru Lynton Crosby, pictured, are said to blame each other for the Conservatives\u0027 failure to win a majority at the snap election in June 2017Tough-talking Crosby is known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’ because of his record of election campaign successes.He helped Right-wing Australian politician John Howard win four elections and secured two victories in London mayoral elections for Boris Johnson.He was reputedly paid £500,000 a year to advise Mr Cameron and helped him pull off a surprise victory over Ed Miliband in 2015.But his campaigning style is not to everyone’s taste. He is credited with inventing ‘dog whistle’ tactics, whereby politicians echo shrill sentiments on populist issues such as immigration, without actually endorsing them.This newspaper disclosed in 2012 how he told Mr Johnson not to bother with ‘f****** Muslims’ in his mayoral campaign, which was clearly echoed in the former Foreign Secretary’s controversial recent comments about the burka.Sir Lynton also once boasted of getting Australian PM Mr Howard elected despite privately calling him ‘as dull as bats***’.He calls his no-nonsense political style ‘getting the barnacles off the boat’ – to offer voters a streamlined message.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/08/4F76239400000578-0-image-a-28_1535698949232.jpg","title":"The cottage five lives Open hall built Middle Ages went post office","story":"    The Old Post Office (pictured) in Kings Worthy, Hampshire, which was originally built as an open hall in the Middle Ages\u0027Get those f**king cameras away from me!\u0027 The very dramatic...Share this article‘It’s a big property but it looks small from the outside,’ he explains. ‘When you come in, you can see it’s like two cottages coming together to form an L-shape.

sexually assaulted her. Argento denied ever having a sexual relationship with the teen, saying she was \u0027deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false.\u0027          The actress has been accused of having sex with actor Jimmy Bennett while he was underage and paying him $380,000 in hush money          The actress directed the Hong Kong episode which Bourdain called a \u0027professional highlight\u0027, pictured on set Argento, however, she did admit to paying off Bennett with the help of Bourdain who \u0027personally undertook to help Bennett economically\u0027 because he was \u0027afraid of the possible negative publicity that such a person, whom he considered dangerous, could have brought upon us.\u0027CNN has responded to the allegations against Argento by discontinuing all episodes where the actress appeared with her boyfriend, Boyfriend. In addition, Bourdain\u0027s Buenos Aires episode of the show in which he visits a therapist and speaks about his depression is no longer available. \u0027I had no choice\u0027: Rose McGowan\u0027s non-binary model lover...\u0027Be the person you wish Harvey could have been\u0027: Rose...Share this

Pictured: Eric in top hat, tails, black shorts and black tights          These publicity stills of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, released by the BBC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the duo’s move from commercial TV to Broadcasting House, are a glowing reminder of what comedy used to be — warm, friendly and infectious          The pictures are a delightful keepsake of the rich friendship between two ridiculously talented performers, who had loyally stuck beside each other since their teens during World War II          Always in tune: Many a famous face appeared on their much-loved show, with Elton John (pictured) performing in 1976  Never shy: Eric showed off in a kilt to Derek Nimmo in this amusing still, left, while right shows the pair on set Look at the boys’ faces in that snapshot of highwayman Dick Turpin and a damsel in distress.

How about that unposed moment with the trumpet, both of them on the brink of helpless laughter? It looks like a rehearsal shot, because Eric isn’t wearing a tie.Ernie, as always, not only has a tie, but cufflinks, gold watch and a breast pocket handkerchief. Eric was no trumpeter, so the instrument is a prop.And his look of triumphant happiness, mouth wide open, tells us he has just delivered a perfect ad lib, a gag that wasn’t in the script.

Above all, they never took themselves too seriously.See Eric as Sooty the bear, with puppeteer Harry Corbett, and the real Sooty perched on his shoulder. All he has to do is assume an air of hurt dignity, and it’s hilarious — Harry and Ern are both sporting broad grins. That costume must have been hot, though: Eric’s face is glistening with sweat. Anyone can see what fun they’re having. It’s one of the reasons celebrity guests clamoured to be on their shows.In the Cossack hats, there’s American singer Diane Solomon, while Australian Keith Michell is the actor joining the duo for a Foreign Legion adventure in the Sahara sands, complete with deckchair and inflatable duck.Of all these glorious images, it’s the one of them sunbathing in shorts that sums them up best. For a start, you know Ern has been subjected to constant teasing about his ‘short, fat, hairy legs’.Then there’s the hoops in the hems of Eric’s shorts, designed for waggling. The finishing touch is his footwear: office shoes polished to a high shine, and long socks hauled high by his sock suspenders.Who wears sock suspenders these days? Come to that, who else could make you laugh out loud, with nothing more than their bare knees?As Eric would say, there’s no answer to that.

To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and a betrayal of that trust.’Mr Johnson’s popularity among Tory Party members has soared since he resigned as Foreign Secretary in July in protest at Mrs May’s Chequers plan, which would see the UK agreeing to follow EU regulations on trade, the environment and social affairs. He said it left the country at risk of ‘economic vassalage’ and accused Mrs May of ‘dithering’ over the UK’s strategy.Momentum founder who propelled Jeremy Corbyn to leadership...Raab insists a Brexit deal is \u0027within our reach\u0027 after new...Share this articleMeanwhile, Mrs May’s allies say that executives working for Sir Lynton’s powerful campaign company, CTF Partners, have been in discussions to ‘put rocket boosters’ under Change Britain, a group set up to argue for a hard Brexit, and turn it into a guerilla campaign against the Chequers deal.They fear that the group will mount rallies around the country headed by Mr Johnson and other high-profile Brexiteers. Change Britain has strong links with the influential European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Mrs May’s allies believe that Sir Lynton’s outfit has been targeting Eurosceptic Tory donors to fund the campaign.They are also suspicious that Mr Jonson seems to have been ‘singing from the Lynton hymn sheet’ since his resignation – and point to the furore over Mr Johnson’s inflammatory claim that burkas make women look like ‘bank robbers’ or ‘letterboxes’. Sir Lynton, 62, is an exponent of so-called ‘dog-whistle politics’, in which controversial messages, couched in relatively inoffensive language, are targeted at the Hard-Right.          The Prime Minister (pictured in Cape Town) last night vowed not to make any compromises to the Chequers deal, nor to ‘give in’ to demands for a second referendum Sir Lynton, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his previous successes, lost some of his lustre after playing a key role in the disastrous 2017 Election campaign which led to the loss of Mrs May’s Commons majority.The row comes as MPs return to the Commons after the summer recess to prepare for a series of bruising battles over Brexit, with Mrs May hoping to strike a final deal with the EU within the next two months and then win Parliament’s approval. But she faces opposition from dozens of Tory MPs in the ERG, who share Mr Johnson’s objections to the Chequers deal.It has led to intense speculation among MPs that if Mrs May tries to force Chequers through, then the ERG would force a vote of no confidence in her. If 48 MPs make such a call, then a vote would be held, triggering a leadership contest if Mrs May lost.A source close to Mr Johnson said: ‘Boris has always backed the aims of Change Britain but he has no role in the organisation.’A spokesman for CTF said that while Sir Lynton had not personally ‘spoken with nor met anyone from Change Britain’, the company’s senior staff ‘were often consulted because of their campaign expertise and knowledge’.He added: ‘The better the deal the Prime Minister secures in Brexit, the better the prospects for the Conservatives at the next Election.’   SIMON WALTERS: Revenge of \u0027Wizard of Oz\u0027 Sir Lynton Crosby blamed for Theresa May\u0027s election humiliationThe feud between Sir Lynton Crosby and Theresa May dates back to her disastrous decision to call a snap election in June 2017.Both are said to blame each other for the fiasco.When Australian-born Crosby first heard of the snap poll from a May aide, he was in Fiji at a family gathering and his stunned response was: ‘I’m not sure that’s a smart idea, mate.’The Mail on Sunday revealed last year how he sent Mrs May a ‘killer memo’ warning her it could backfire. He said there was ‘a lot of risk’ in calling a surprise ballot: voters were desperate to ‘avoid uncertainty’– but by going to the polls, she was doing the opposite.Instead of the landslide win she expected, she could do no better than David Cameron’s narrow win in 2015, Crosby advised. In the event she did worse, and lost her Commons majority.For their part, Mrs May’s supporters said she blamed him for key campaign mistakes.They blamed Crosby for ordering her to run a presidential style ‘strong and stable’ campaign which collapsed days after the manifesto launch when she was forced to tear up plans for a so-called ‘dementia tax.’ Sir Lynton also fell out with Mrs May’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, with Timothy subsequently accusing him of failing to spot Jeremy Corbyn’s support among young voters.          Theresa May and election guru Lynton Crosby, pictured, are said to blame each other for the Conservatives\u0027 failure to win a majority at the snap election in June 2017Tough-talking Crosby is known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’ because of his record of election campaign successes.He helped Right-wing Australian politician John Howard win four elections and secured two victories in London mayoral elections for Boris Johnson.He was reputedly paid £500,000 a year to advise Mr Cameron and helped him pull off a surprise victory over Ed Miliband in 2015.But his campaigning style is not to everyone’s taste. He is credited with inventing ‘dog whistle’ tactics, whereby politicians echo shrill sentiments on populist issues such as immigration, without actually endorsing them.This newspaper disclosed in 2012 how he told Mr Johnson not to bother with ‘f****** Muslims’ in his mayoral campaign, which was clearly echoed in the former Foreign Secretary’s controversial recent comments about the burka.Sir Lynton also once boasted of getting Australian PM Mr Howard elected despite privately calling him ‘as dull as bats***’.He calls his no-nonsense political style ‘getting the barnacles off the boat’ – to offer voters a streamlined message.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/21/4F9CA3DA00000578-0-image-a-15_1535834024498.jpg","title":"The shocking plight Americas child brides aged young 13","story":"    Donna Pollard (pictured aged 14) was raped in the year this photo was taken by her 29-year-old counsellor and forced to marry him two years later Indeed, that very act of matrimony helped Donna’s abuser, a mental health counsellor almost twice her age, evade charges for statutory rape under laws that only applied to younger victims and could have put him behind bars for many years.‘I am appalled the law could allow such a thing,’ Donna told me. ‘Laws are supposed to protect victims, not the people who exploit them.

Donna, pictured now, is fighting back against her abuserAnd there are thousands more of these disturbing cases scattered across the United States, a few involving girls not yet into their teens when forced into matrimony. Some hail from religious communities, some from poor rural areas, some from prosperous cities.This is the legacy of archaic laws and outdated views on teenage pregnancy.Astonishingly, child marriage is still sanctioned in much of the United States – and some conservative politicians and libertarian activists fight to protect the practice.Although data is incomplete, one study found that, during the first 15 years of this century, at least 207,459 minors – legally defined as those under 18 – were allowed to marry. Almost all were girls, and most were aged 16 and 17 – but 12-year-olds received permits in three states and 13-year-olds in 14 states, including Kentucky.In Alabama, a 74-year-old man was given a licence to marry a 14-year-old girl – yet, as in many other cases including Donna’s, this relationship would have led to a statutory rape charge and being placed on the sex offenders register had it occurred outside marriage.Kentucky had the third-highest number of US child marriages, with 11,000 being permitted since 2000. But thanks to the efforts of Donna – who was one of those cases – a new law signed last month bans unions for people under 18 – although 17-year-olds can marry if they meet strict restrictions.          Judy Wiegand - aged just 13 - is pictured when she was forced to marry the man who had raped her Donna’s story is horrific, although ultimately inspiring. Her father, a long-distance lorry driver, was loving but often away with work. He already had two children when, at 17, he married Donna’s mother, who was just 13 at the time and later suffered mental health problems.Her mother was cold and violent, frequently beating her with a stick. When Donna was 13, her father died and soon after she began to fight back when attacked by her mother. As a result, she was sent to see a psychologist and ended up in a special behavioural unit for five weeks.There, the vulnerable, lonely girl was seized upon by a 29-year-old counsellor. ‘He was very nice to me, very compassionate, making me feel special with lots of attention,’ said Donna. ‘I just wanted to please him because I wanted someone to be kind to me.’My 15 years in a cult: Glenn Close on the devastating effect...Family of Osama bin Laden fear his son is intent on...Share this articleSoon they were having secret meetings, hugs and finally sex – although she was just 14. After Donna’s release, incredibly, her own mother drove her weekly to a hotel to carry on the relationship. ‘She saw him as an exit card, a way to relieve the burden of me.’Shortly after Donna’s 16th birthday, the counsellor’s own mother discovered what was going on and threatened to tell the police. The man whipped out a gun, threatened to kill himself, then turned it on his mother and drove her out of the house.Within days, Donna and her abuser were before a court clerk, who did not even look up from her computer when asking who was the minor. Donna’s mother and the official signed a licence – and the troubled teenager was taken straight off to be married by a preacher to a paedophile.          Glenda Welp with the violent neighbour she was forced to marry at 14 and their daughter, Tabitha Her school turned her away, so Donna lost a precious scholarship and her education was stymied. She was pregnant at 17, yet her controlling and violent husband forced her to work in a strip club, making her hand over wages and procure him drugs and girls.She determined to flee after seeing her infant daughter laugh – thinking they were playing a game – while she was being throttled on the ground by her husband. ‘I went to a domestic violence centre,’ said Donna. ‘But they turned me away since I was under 18 and a minor.’She finally escaped at 19. Remarkably, she went on to college and obtained a degree a few years later, but kept her abuse and marriage hidden even from friends while struggling with serious psychological damage, including depression and severe anxiety.Two years ago, aged 32 and working as a health care manager, Donna decided to find out if other women had suffered similar situations and ended up talking with Jeanne Smoot from the Tahirih Justice Center, which opposes gender-based violence. ‘I told her my goal was to change the law in my home state,’ she said.Smoot, senior counsel with the TJC, argues such cases show the urgent need for reform across the country. ‘The state is failing to recognise child abuse,’ she said. ‘These laws are the vestige of antiquated and misguided assumptions of what is in a girl’s best interests.’Smoot added that many terrified victims went to courts desperately hoping they would be saved by officials, only to find their trauma intensifying.‘One girl told me she was crying, which the court clerk interpreted as jitters and told her it should be the happiest day of her life.’          Glenda (pictured today) is now fighting back against the abuse she suffered The Kentucky reform was promoted by Republican state senator Julie Adams, who said she was astounded when she met Donna last autumn. ‘My jaw was on the floor as she was telling her story,’ she said. ‘It was mind-boggling. I had no idea about child marriage.’Yet when she raised the issue, Adams was stunned by the volume of emails and letters she received from women disclosing similar experiences. ‘As a society, we allowed this marginalisation of women to be legal. We had to connect our civil and criminal laws.’The issue exposes great hypocrisy in a country that campaigns against child marriage around the world. ‘There’s no place in civilised society for the early or forced marriage of children,’ said Barack Obama when president.He is right. Yet it only really emerged in the US when a few brave survivors such as Donna started telling their life stories in public to protect future generations from suffering similar fates.Many women were suffering in silence, thinking their cases were unique. But since Donna set up a support group, called Survivors’ Corner, other women who have suffered similar experiences have come forward.Delaware became the first state to outlaw all marriage of minors in May, despite claims it would lead to more abortions from one opponent. Several others – including Texas, which had most marriages of minors this century – have updated and strengthened their laws.Yet 18 states still do not set an age floor, including Idaho, which has the highest rates of child marriage per head.Seven states have laws that accept pregnancy as a reason to waive minimum age rules and only 13 require minors to get approval from a judge before they marry.Reform has met resistance from some conservatives, including Albert Robinson, senator for the county where Donna lived when married.‘When he spoke against the bill, it was as if he was saying it was OK my rape was legal in his county because I was married,’ she told me.Robinson, a former sausage maker turned property dealer, told me he was opposed to government interference in family life. ‘The parents are the reason the child exists and I find it hard to believe any parents would force their child into marriage.‘If the parents of the father-to-be and the pregnant girl can work things out, that’s a lot better than having an abortion,’ he added. ‘My wife’s mother married at 14 and she arrived a year later – and she’s one of the best things that ever happened to me.’Robinson backs child marriage yet opposes marriage for gay and lesbian adults. He is not alone: in nearby Rowan county, which has permitted 92 minors to marry this century, the court clerk famously went to jail rather than issue wedding licences to same-sex couples.Such arguments over parental rights angered Judy Wiegand, a paediatric therapist who suffered deeply as a naive 13-year-old forced to marry her 17-year-old rapist.Wiegand never dared tell anyone about the assault at a roller skating rink, thinking she must have been partly to blame, but then became pregnant. ‘My father was very angry,’ she said. ‘But in my mind I thought I had broken the rules and put myself in a bad place.’They lived in a religious, ultra-conservative rural community, so the pair’s mothers agreed their teenagers should marry. When they went to see the county clerk to get a permit, ‘she looked at me down her glasses like I was tainted and never spoke to me,’ said Wiegand.She wore a yellow dress to get married, a slender girl weighing little more than five stone. ‘I still slept with a teddy bear and played with my Barbies. I just wanted it all to be over. There was a preacher but he did not really talk to me either.’Her subsequent story echoed others I heard: she was badly abused, her schooling was stopped, she became quickly pregnant again, then left after the child was threatened.Searching for security, she rebounded into another bad relationship before finally finding stability. ‘It was really hard to build a decent life,’ said Wiegand, now happily married. ‘I never had a first date, I never had a prom, I never graduated from school. I missed so much.’Some of these unions were horrifically violent, such as that of Glenda Welp, who at 14 was made to marry a neighbour twice her age who beat her regularly. She suffered seizures after having a typewriter smashed on her head when eight-months pregnant. When she managed to escape, her husband came after her with a gun. ‘He said he was going to kill me, my baby and then himself.’Fortunately Welp’s mother called the police. ‘He was just getting ready to shoot us when he heard the siren and ran off, but still tried taking the TV.’Others were treated less violently but were still victims of paedophiles, such as Loretta Scott, a 38-year-old carer. She started being pursued aged just 12 by a man attending her Pentecostal church who befriended her family, then was forced to marry him by her parents three years later.‘I cried myself to sleep,’ she said. ‘He stopped me going to school, which was where all my friends were, and did not want me around boys. One time my brother came to visit but was told not to come back. He wanted to control everything and everyone who spoke with me.’After four years, she fled and later discovered her husband had married two other teenage girls. ‘It’s such a difficult thing to get over. I’ve never really talked about it with anyone,’ said Scott. ‘I have a girl of ten and I just can’t imagine sending her away.’Sherry Johnson, a prominent campaigner in Florida, revealed she was married to her rapist at 11 after becoming pregnant.Unsurprisingly, studies find child brides far more likely to suffer severe health, financial and educational difficulties throughout their lives than other women.Ironically, they also fare worse than unmarried teenage mothers since they are far more likely to quickly have a second child, said Vivian Hamilton, a law professor who has testified before several state hearings on the issue.Like so many others, Hamilton is stunned to find these practices still existing in the United States. ‘I don’t think God wants little girls marrying rapists,’ said one survivor to me.‘It is so bizarre that this is still going on in this day and age.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/08/4F76239400000578-0-image-a-28_1535698949232.jpg","title":"The cottage five lives Open hall built Middle Ages went post office","story":"    The Old Post Office (pictured) in Kings Worthy, Hampshire, which was originally built as an open hall in the Middle Ages\u0027Get those f**king cameras away from me!\u0027 The very dramatic...Share this article‘It’s a big property but it looks small from the outside,’ he explains. ‘When you come in, you can see it’s like two cottages coming together to form an L-shape.

Produced by the makers of Poldark, ITV’s new version of Vanity Fair (starting on Sunday) similarly shows a likable low-born woman winning the heart of a toff – several toffs, in her case – in the Napoleonic era. Gwyneth Hughes adapted the novel and has talked of a tradition of viewing Thackeray’s 1848 novel as “a harsh story ... about a naughty social climber”, whereas her Becky is “a poor orphan who needs to get on – if she doesn’t, she’ll starve”.Played by Olivia Cooke, the artist’s daughter may become more bitter and ruthless in later instalments, but in part one she’s sweet and vulnerable with no flaws on show: no ulterior motives in her friendship with Amelia, and nothing blameworthy in her wooing of a rich dunce. Hughes presents her as a bilingual modern European woman, belonging to the new era – symbolically dumping 18th-century England by throwing away Johnson’s Dictionary and crying “Vive Bonaparte!” – when those around her are stuck in the old, insular one.Appearing at 10-or 20-year intervals, TV adaptations of Vanity Fair tend to come towards the ends of decades and inevitably find parallels with their own times. In a 1967 BBC production, Susan Hampshire’s Becky was a proto-60s chick, resembling the liberated protagonists of contemporary films. Twenty years on, at the height of the Thatcher era, Eve Matheson’s spunky redhead “who will stop at nothing” (as the publicity proclaimed) could hardly fail to embody the spirit of the age.In 1998, Natasha Little was the anti-heroine in an Andrew Davies-scripted serial that epitomised the “harsh” approach. Her Becky too (as a complementary BBC documentary invoking 90s celebrities like Madonna underlined) reflected her decade, but could also be seen as encapsulating the ethos of the 18-year Tory reign that had just ended.Cheering on Becky, rather than tut-tutting, starts on the big screen with the 2004 Reese Witherspoon movie: with a star committed to empowering women, a feminist Indian director (Mira Nair) drawn to social outsiders, and a script by a future Tory peer (Julian Fellowes) predisposed to applaud the Thatcherite ambition other adapters despised, she was always bound to rebound.As well as endorsing this pro-Becky perspective, the ITVAmazon Vanity Fair performs the customary function of depicting its own decade in historical guise: the Cameron years, when a resurgent feminism collided with a snobbish, sexist elite that closed ranks instead of opening itself up – and, fortuitously, the snooty figure who blocks Becky’s entry to it in the opener (by nixing her chances of marrying Jos Sedley) is George Osborne.Among its innovations is the deployment of Michael Palin as Thackeray, genially introducing episodes with a merry-go-round as backdrop (a reworking of the novel’s image of its world as a puppet theatre). This is not quite the first appearance of the novelist on screen, since Palin has a distinguished predecessor in the 1979 French film Les soeurs Bronte, the Thackeray who meets the sisters in London is played by ... Roland Barthes.• Part one of Vanity Fair is on ITV on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9faeb4c327cb6177190c9bd89d44bd7761cd76/0_64_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3751efc5250e230c9010b6138652bce","title":"halle berry and prince harrys teenage kicks","story":"I’m not a big believer in hereditary privilege, though I will make an exception and become mildly interested in the dramas of the royal family when it comes to watching The Crown on\u0026nbspNetflix.It’s hard to remain put out by the idea of people inheriting power at birth when distracted by Princess Margaret’s wild parties and the promise of Olivia Colman being officially ordained as the queen that she is. But as the saying sort of goes, old photographs of teenage bedrooms are a window into the soul, so when pictures of an 18-year-old Prince Harry sitting in his dorm at Eton resurfaced last week, I immediately clicked on them.So, too, did Halle Berry, who saw herself in the background, pinned to the middle of a lovely piece of fabric, flanked by two other anonymous ladies in bikinis, who had been beheaded, though thankfully only by the framing of the photo (what is this, 1536?). “Ok #PrinceHarry, I see you,” she tweeted, followed by the laughing-face emoji, a hashtagged lyric from Missy Elliott’s Work It – “#HalleBerryPosta” – and an @-mention of Missy Elliott.While I’m sure Prince Harry has enough going on right now to get over it, there’s something cartoon-nightmarish about your teenage tastes coming back to haunt you. There is little more excruciating than being forced to confront your half-formed self who, for a time, let’s say, thought it would be a great idea to get a tattoo of the artwork from the CD single for Radiohead’s Street Spirit (Fade Out), just to pluck a totally made-up example out of fantasy air, which is definitely not real and thank god for mandatory age regulations in tattoo parlours. And, no, you didn’t copy out several meaningful lines from The Bell Jar into a special notebook called “Quotes” that you kept by your bed.For those of us not in the public eye, it’s unlikely that any of our worst bedroom wall transgressions will re-emerge and what a relief.To flip through my own mental archive of walls I knew and loved, there were “Adihash” posters, collages made by Pritt-sticking overlapping bleak newspaper headlines on to a black sheet of cardboard and, I’m sorry to report, pencil drawings of Kurt Cobain.It makes me grateful for the fact that blanket internet access and constant cameras weren’t a thing in the 90s and early 00s, because I can’t imagine anything worse than an archived reminder of what we shall only refer to as “the Che Guevara era”popping up on Facebook Memories once a year.Stacey Solomon led the resistance in a week when celebrity culture turned feral (see the bizarre gladiatorial spectacle of the Loose Women v Kim Woodburn) by tweeting her offence at a magazine cover that stuck the words “boring”, “desperate” and “cheap” underneath a picture of her looking perturbed that she was being called boring, desperate and\u0026nbspcheap.After Solomon pointed out that it was mean, Now issued a statement clarifying that it was just saying that some people on social media thought that and it was sorry “for any distress our story may have caused” which isn’t quite the same as being sorry for being mean and is basically a “sor-reeee”, the sort of tactic kids use when they don’t really want to say sorry at all.Celebrity mags usually couch their insults in the tone of a concerned friend, whether they’re pointing out weight loss, weight gain, alcoholism, drug use, bad boyfriends or any of the other grim detritus floating around fame, so this gloves-off straight talk has been a long time coming. It’s as if they’re finally pulling back the curtain and saving us all the hassle of reading between the lines.I have put clothes on inside out owing to factors as trivial as an alarm going off before 7am, so it’s little wonder that Alizé Cornet found she was wearing her shirt back to front at her first-round US Open tennis match in 35C heat.Rather than holding proceedings up further by going back into the changing rooms, she simply whipped it off and put it back on the right way. She was immediately issued with a code violation by the umpire. The confusion on her face in that moment is a testament to the stupidity of the sanction, which suggested that the sight of an overheated female athlete in a sports bra is titillating in a way that a sweaty man giving his nipples an airing is not.After a backlash from women in the sport, the US Open apologised and clarified that, like men, female players can change tops while in their chair.Cornet’s reaction to the kerfuffle was classy. She used it to draw attention to comments made by the French Tennis Federation president, Bernard Giudicelli, about banning catsuits such as the one Serena Williams wore at the French Open in May. “It will no longer be accepted,” he told Tennis magazine. “One must respect the game and the place.”Williams was wearing the catsuit because of an ongoing problem with blood clots and Giudicelli’s call for “respect” was ill-judged, at best. “What he said about Serena’s catsuit was 10,000 times worse than what happened to me,” Cornet said.During her first round at the US Open, Williams wore a lavender tutu, which looked good forwards, backwards, and when she won her match too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_131_5897_3539/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4832966e3203290d81ee5df13a4579b3","title":"labour must lead calls peoples vote brexit","story":"The party has a duty to millions of people to mobilise opposition to the government’s ruinous course of actionIn 1981, the Gang of Four split from Labour to form the Social Democratic party (SDP). The new party did not come close to power, but it won a huge number of votes – 7.8m in 1983 – and kept Labour out of government for a generation. In this time, Margaret Thatcher set fire to the fabric of British society: depriving schools and hospitals of funding, annihilating British industries, disempowering unions and accelerating privatisation.Growing up in Tottenham with a single mother who worked several jobs to put food on the table, I experienced first hand how splits on the left let Thatcher turn Britain cold.Today, Labour’s vision for a fairer society faces a similar threat. The development of a new centrist rival has been an open secret in the Westminster tea rooms for months. Funding from iniduals and big business is rumoured to be already in place. As the New Statesman reported, a split has become “inevitable”.For the past two years, my party has remained stubborn in its commitment to Brexit, while never fully ruling out the possibility of a referendum on the final deal. While I would never have supported it, tacticians may once have been able to justify a position of “constructive ambiguity”. This time has now passed. With just months remaining until we leave the EU, the clock is ticking for us to save the country from this hard-right Tory fantasy, which was built on xenophobia, lies and a law-breaking campaign.As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made clear, the Chequers agreement in its current form will be rejected because it requires the “unravelling” of core parts of the EU. Meanwhile, the reality of the no-deal alternative is so bleak, it is almost impossible. The only deal acceptable to EU that gives the UK the access it needs is something close to European Economic Area membership. Very soon, Labour will have to decide whether to save Theresa May and vote for this or call for a people’s vote, which offers the chance to remain in the EU.If the official opposition does not stand by the inevitable results of Keir Starmer’s six tests and oppose Brexit, a new party will, with the clear purpose of restoring the UK’s economy, our country’s place at the top table of diplomacy and stealing the open, internationalist vision that for so long has been associated with Labour. It’s impossible to predict how well this party will do. Whether it eventually wins 20 seats or 200, a new party will more than likely block us, the Labour party, and condemn Britain to at least another decade of disastrous Tory dominance.Much of the excitement around Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leader has been based on his promise to democratise the party. For this, he deserves credit. But to honour this promise, the party conference must be allowed to determine Labour’s Brexit position. Preventing a vote on the biggest political decision this country is facing would be a betrayal.The strategic argument for Labour’s opposition to Brexit has emerged over time, but the underlying reasons have been self-evident from day one. The party of Keir Hardie simply cannot vote with the government as it kneecaps our economy, savages environmental and workers’ rights and constrains the horizons of our young supporters to this small island, against their will.If we want to build a fairer and more equal Britain, it’s time for Labour to stop pussyfooting around and lead calls for a people’s vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f334a05b4f468ff31f82c4e97c05530a","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

It was a clear day – blue sky from horizon to frozen horizon. Three dirty black buses rolled into the makeshift rest stop and 200 Syrian people climbed down off the big final bus step in need of food and a toilet break. Anywhere else in the world, a group of people like these would be smiling tourists on their way north or south, to the snow or the desert.Richard and I had followed this river of Syria’s people and all of them were on a journey of escape, fleeing unimaginable horror, men in black clothes, murderous men, murderous civil war and the end of their homeland. And their destination was thousands of kilometres north in a direction none had ever imagined they would travel, to a future utterly unknown. Among them were doctors and firefighters, teachers, mechanics and university students.I noticed that day that the young men who huddled their little families around themselves were blank, their eyes full of the shock of profound loss. These men had failed their families they had run, deserted the homeland that hundreds of their generations had built for so many thousands of years before them. Richard softly ushered these men and their wives to a quiet corner of the complex, with warm coffee and the soothing, loving attitude he shows all his fellows humans, and as they spoke he wrote they shared stories and they cried.To quieten the children, I caught their attention. First they were hungry they ate. Speaking no Arabic, and without translation, I gestured to the little people around me to draw. To tell me about themselves. Grubby little boys drew rainbows and orange trees, and the girls drew princesses and yellow suns. Some lost interest quickly so we used my paper to make aeroplanes with a design my own little boy had discovered, a paper aeroplane that flew and flew, and before long six little boys ran and laughed and watched the plane briefly sweep away the trauma that must surely have travelled with them on those buses, and in their tiny backpacks, all the way from Syria.One little girl didn’t stop drawing. She barely glanced up at the paper aeroplanes dancing in the blue sky above her. She drew and she drew. She was self-possessed in her determination, and I guessed that maybe I’d been like her when I was six.She drew an orchard and a garden. She drew fruit trees and the sun, her grandma and her school. She drew flowers and she drew birds. I asked her to draw her home for me. Heba looked into my eyes for a fleeting but intense second, and I saw a seriousness that no six-year-old should understand. Then she drew quickly, deliberately, and at the end passed me the drawing of the end of her home and returned to another drawing of a fruit-laden tree on vivid green grass.That day Heba made me realise how imperative it is for the world to see her drawing, for the world to see drawings by every child who has survived the Syrian disaster. Big people have big voices and most of them ignore the small voices of the smallest among us. And Heba was one of the most vulnerable little humans I have met, but her voice is big, her story is as graphic as it is tragic, if only we give her a second, to listen and consider the message that she gave me to show you.Children who have given their art and their voice are living in informal refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. There are more than a million Syrian refugees in that valley alone. Some gave me their drawings hours after making the terrifying and deadly crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey to Lesbos and Chios. They have drawn from camps and accommodation in Jordan and Iraq, and some have had their drawings carefully smuggled out of Syria itself. The drawings that are untitled and anonymous were carried from dangerous war zones where parents feared that a simple child’s name would bring evil to their doorstep. Some have lost siblings, some have lost a mum, some lost their dad every one of them has lost their home. But every child knew that you would eventually see their drawings, and so you would hear their voice, feel their story. There are drawings by children in the suburbs of Sydney, trying to find the meaning of their new lives, and there are others who have drawn from Germany.I haven’t found Heba yet but I trust she’s safely beginning a new life in Germany.Home – Drawings by Syrian Children is for that little girl, for her future, for the empathy that she deserves from every human on my planet who is luckier than she is. It is a book filled with the truest international language, and it is a language that we big people need to listen to closely and seriously.This is an edited extract from Home – Drawings by Syrian Children, edited by Ben Quilty, foreword by Richard Flanagan.

Vincent Kompany took a microphone to tell the crowd “this is just the beginning” and, ultimately, it was another freewheeling win for the reigning champions to usher in their first decade of Abu Dhabi ownership.No surprise, either, given that Newcastle’s record at this stadium is so calamitous. This was their 10th successive league defeat on this ground and, for City, that equals a club record going back to the 1930s when they did the same to Wolves. Newcastle have conceded 34 goals in the process and the differing fortunes of these clubs could be explained via the songbooks of the two sets of supporters. From the home fans, there were tributes to the sheikh to mark the 10th anniversary of his takeover. As for Newcastle’s followers, their discord manifested itself in mutinous chants against Mike Ashley, a very different kind of owner.Worse sides have visited this stadium but not many have played with such a lack of adventure. It was disappointing that Rafael Benítez’s team offered so little, attacking-wise, once DeAndre Yedlin’s equaliser had offered Newcastle hope on the back of Raheem Sterling’s early goal.Newcastle held their own in the first half but, such is the lopsided nature of the Premier League, it did not matter greatly in the end that City’s performance rarely ventured above six out of 10. They could afford to have an off day when the opposition was so inferior and the narrow margin of victory felt like a deception: this was a comfortable win once Kyle Walker had restored the home side’s lead with a firecracker of a shot early in the second half.Guardiola noted afterwards that while his team had defended “very, very bad” for Newcastle’s goal, they did not concede another meaningful chance against a side whose tactics were based entirely on playing on the counterattack. He also addressed the fact that Leroy Sané was left out of the squad, though if there is a problem between the two then Guardiola was reluctant to say what it was.Sané has not started a single game so far this season, his only contributions being three substitute appearances, and his omission from the bench was apparently because Guardiola had detected slackness on the training ground.The German struggled during a brief appearance in the 1-1 draw at Wolves last weekend but when Guardiola was asked if the player’s attitude was in question he denied the suggestion, stating it was simply a consequence of City’s squad size. “In the last game, Phil Foden was not in the squad and I was so sad for him, just as I’m so sad for Leroy.”Instead, Sterling was operating on City’s left wing, with Riyad Mahrez on the right and David Silva in the space directly behind Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus. This was Sterling’s 100th league appearance for City and his goal was a fine finish, cutting inside Yedlin before aiming a diagonal shot past Martin Dubravka from the edge of the penalty area. Jamaal Lascelles, Newcastle’s captain, had given the ball away with a slack pass, and at this level no team can expect to get away with that kind of carelessness.After that, Newcastle might well have been surprised by how few problems they encountered through the rest of the first half. Again, they spent long periods pinned in their own half, just as they did against Chelsea last weekend. There were, however, encouraging signs for Benítez’s team on the few occasions when they did venture forward and their new striker Salomón Rondón looked eager to impress, laying on the decisive pass for their 29th-minute equaliser.Rondón had picked out Yedlin’s run to the far post and when his low delivery went through John Stones’s legs there were no other defenders in position. Instead, it was Jesus, a striker, trying to catch Yedlin inside the penalty area. Yedlin reached the ball first and City were punished for their disorganisation.It was unusual to see City looking as lethargic as they did in the opening half and Jesus, in particular, found it difficult before his substitution after 56 minutes. City, in short, looked like they missed Kevin De Bruyne, but a wonderful shot from Walker from 30 yards out put them back in front, fizzing the ball into the bottom corner for his first Manchester City goal.Benítez might reflect that his goalkeeper should not have been beaten from that distance. Yet Dubravka saved Newcastle from a more punishing ordeal in the last half an hour, including a triple save to deny Fernandinho and then Silva, twice. Ederson, City’s goalkeeper, was largely untroubled, and Newcastle have now gone 22 league games without beating these opponents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5588fb60bef281482a0910da5ca8682df8c746ba/528_256_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d63904a6e9b767d5b22f6dde3bd454","title":"more mourinho mithering and saido berahino scores football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Lars Sivertsen to discuss Mourinho (again), Carabao Cup action, Declan Rice’s international dilemma, Hal Robson-Kanu’s international retirement and flesh-eating ratsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

It’s still a no from meWith the long school summer holidays coming to an end, I would like to offer my annual thanks to the nation’s parents for another six weeks of sterling service. Not merely for raising future generations of doctors, scientists and Love Island contestants, but also for my annual refresher course on fertility choices. It’s still a no from me.In Westfield Stratford City this week, for example, I watched a father sitting by the outdoor human-sized chess set. This board is a lovely touch by the shopping mall, giving locals of all ages some free, open-air fun. On any warm day, adults and older kids queue up for games, but not on this day, as a small screaming boy of about six years old had screwed the bottom off the man-sized rook and was spraying the sand inside it (intended to weigh it down) all over the board. His father sat motionless on a bench close by.As his son moved on to begin emptying the queen, the man stared not at the boy, but through him. It was week six of the summer holidays. This father’s eyes had seen so much. So much screaming, so much destruction. He reminded me of Charlie Sheen in his “Hell is the impossibility of reason” monologue in the Vietnam movie Platoon. It was clear that reasoning with his child about why it might be nicer to, say, not make a noise like a reversing Securicor van while wantonly wrecking the chess set-up was an option the father no longer considered.Later, in Boots, I watched a girl of around 10 in full meltdown because, as far as we could all hear, her mother had put restrictions on her iPhone usage. As the mother tried to suggest that six full weeks of her daughter’s tweenage girlgang slagging off each other’s pouting Snapchats, forming online cliques, swapping allegiances and leaving shady Instagram comments had sent the girl quite mad, her daughter became increasingly aggressive. As I left the chemist, I thanked the lord for the Levonelle One Step morning-after pill. Or as one of my more realistic mother friends wrote on Facebook last week, “I am at the fucking Peppa Pig Live Show. Use a Durex, people.”But now, thanks to the likes of Brigitte Nielsen pushing out a fifth baby at 54, and US senator Tammy Duckworth, 50, taking her newborn to protest against Trump’s immigration policy, it seems there’s no end point. No real excuse not to keep trying. Women’s fertility has never been in such a weird place. Fifty is the new 40! Sixty is the new 51! Wombwise, the fat lady never really sings. There are new medical ways and means to reproduce if you have cash, patience and emotional staying power.There’s limitless time, it seems, to change one’s mind. I found myself recently ogling YouTube videos of Janet Jackson’s October 2017 State Of The World tour performances. Aged 51, she was slinky, powerful and perfect, nailing all the moves and high kicks of the Rhythm Nation routine. This was just short of a year after she gave birth to her baby Eissa, and in that time she’d dropped about 70lbs, escaped an unhappy marriage, and re-learned all the shoulder swivels from the What Have You Done For Me Lately video. And for a moment, I thought, “Maybe I could do this. I could have it all.” Not the shoulder pads and the pop’n’lock routine, no but the limitless energy, the stellar career, the freedom to pursue my creative needs, plus the baby, without changing my whole life. But then I remembered Westfield Stratford City.And this, British parents, is why I thank you from the bottom of my heart for summer 2018. The broken father on the sandy chessboard. The mother in Boots with the tantrumming tween. All of you in Giraffe right now pretending you like the brunch. Everyone who has been strong-armed into shelling out £75 for some cross-eyed monstrosity from the Build-A-Bear Workshop. Everyone spending today panic-buying school sports kit that will be lost in the first week. Thank you for raising the future. You’re all amazing. But it’s still a no from me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432f3b87044509c3ca5cac71ee3c7d3cc1f0d0c9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0a236d603bb913f4f6d545c25540d1a","title":"mind power in auschwitz and healing decades later edith eger","story":"Her mother’s wisdom helped Edith Eger create a happy inner life in Auschwitz – but true healing meant going back thereEdith Eger was 16 years old, crammed into a cattle truck, human cargo from Hungary headed for Auschwitz, when her mother gave her the advice that shaped her life. For most of the journey, her mother hadn’t said much, hadn’t cried or complained, but had instead gone inside herself. “That night,” says Eger, “she turned to me and said: ‘Listen. We don’t know where we’re going. We don’t know what’s going to happen. Just remember, no one can take away from you what you’ve put in your mind.”For the next year, Eger’s inner life – cherished memories, favourite recipes, future fantasies – sustained her, even saved her. After liberation, though, it turned against her. Survivor’s guilt, buried memories and constant flashbacks held her hostage. A siren, a shouting man, a piece of barbed wire could hurl her back to 1944. Ultimately, Eger’s mission to understand her mind and utilise its power led her to become an acclaimed psychologist specialising in trauma. Her mother’s words have formed her life’s work.Now 90, smiling and immaculate in vivid turquoise, she talks to me from her light-filled home office in La Jolla, California. Her next patient is due in an hour. “I do not believe in retirement,” she says in heavily accented English. “My patients are my teachers.” Life now is good. “I live in paradise with an ocean view from the front and a beautiful canyon view at the back,” she says. “I go dancing once a week. I live in the present and I think young. I’m kind of celebrating every moment.”Eger’s book, The Choice, is an international bestseller and took 10 years to write. She began it after the birth of her first great-grandson, for her family to read. “I was hoping it would be in their living rooms, and they’d see me as a good role model,” she says. “Its reception has been the biggest miracle of my life.” But transporting herself out of her “paradise” and back to hell was not easy. “It was very difficult, but I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever done,” she says, “because, you see, the opposite of depression is expression. I was able to put it out there and cry and cry. With every page I lost 2,000lb of emotional weight.”Eger’s story starts in Košice, Hungary (now Slovakia) with her parents and two older sisters. Her father, a tailor, was a lover of life. Her mother was more distant, prone to disappointment. One sister, Klara, a violin prodigy, studied in Budapest, where she managed to hide throughout the war. Another, Magda, was the “jokester”, the one with the attitude. Eger was the “invisible one”. “I was a very erudite teenager,” she says. “I had my own book club and was reading Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams. Why? Because my mother told me, ‘I’m glad you have brains because you have no looks!’” So an ordinary family, as imperfect as any other.With the Nazi grip came curfews, yellow stars and evictions. Life tightened for Jewish families. One night in April 1944, soldiers pounded on their door and took Eger, Magda and her parents to a brick factory where they lived for a month with 12,000 other Jews. Next was Auschwitz. On arrival, Eger’s father was herded away with the men and her mother was also separated when the infamous “Angel of Death”, Dr Josef Mengele ordered anyone under 14 or over 40 to a different line. (“She’s just going to take a shower,” Mengele told Eger when she tried to follow her.) Eger never saw either parent again.Her survival in Auschwitz is partly testament to the power of her mind. On her first night, while she was adjusting to the inconceivable, Mengele entered her barracks looking for “new talent”. He ordered Eger, a trained ballerina, to dance. Somehow, she closed her eyes and transformed the barracks into the Budapest Opera House. Somehow she earned a loaf of bread.“In Auschwitz, we never knew from one moment to another what was going to happen,” says Eger. “I couldn’t fight or flee, but I learned how to stay in a situation and make the best of what is. I still had choices. So when we were stripped and shorn of our hair, Magda asked me, ‘How do I look?’ She looked like a mangy dog, but I told her: ‘Your eyes are so beautiful. I never noticed when you had all that hair.’ Every day, we could choose to pay attention to what we’d lost or what we still had.”After six months, as Americans and Russians advanced, the Nazis began to evacuate the camp, and the sisters were forced to join the “death march” across Europe. When GIs finally lifted them from a pile of bodies in an Austrian forest, Eger had typhoid fever, pneumonia, pleurisy and a broken back. Healing her body took time – but in a year she was married to Béla, whom she met in hospital. (He, too, had lost his family, but survived in the mountains, joining the partisan resistance.) “At that time, all we asked was: ‘How can we be normal?’” says Eger, “and ‘normal’ meant getting married.” On her honeymoon, she became pregnant – against the advice of doctors who believed Eger too weak. Her daughter, Marianne, was a healthy 10lb baby.But mental recovery took far longer. Neither Eger nor Magda talked about what had happened – not to each other or anyone else. Denial was their shield. “We felt that the more securely we locked it away, the safer we were.” Magda, Eger and her new family all emigrated to the US. Thousands of miles separated Eger from her past, but the memories and trauma came with her.In The Choice, Eger describes her flashbacks – her racing heart and narrowing vision – in visceral detail. Once, in Baltimore, taking the bus to her factory job, Eger boarded the European way, taking her seat and awaiting a ticket collector. The driver yelled, “Pay or get off!” He got up and walked towards her. She fell cowering to the ground, crying and shaking.Though Eger refused to speak of her past to her three children, her 10-year-old daughter Marianne found a history book with pictures of the skeletal corpses piled in a heap. She asked her mother what it was and Eger had to run from the room and vomit in the bathroom. Settling in El Paso, Béla and Eger built a comfortable life. Béla qualified as an accountant and in her late 30s Eger began studying psychology at the University of Texas. Slowly, cautiously, she started to talk about the Holocaust and examine her experience, intent on learning how we survive trauma and what transforms a “victim” into a “survivor”. She took an MA, a PhD, then earned her licence to practise.Specialising in post-traumatic stress (Eger objects to calling it a “disorder” as it’s a common and natural response to trauma), Eger began working with the American military. But her true breakthrough came when she was 53 years old. “I had a white coat and it said ‘Dr Eger’, but I felt like an imposter because I did not really deal with my past,” she says. “I could not be a good guide to my patients or take them any further than I’d gone myself. For that, I had to go back to the lion’s den and look at the place where my mother was murdered, where I was so close to death every day.”It was during this return to Auschwitz that Eger confronted a devastating truth, a memory she’d hidden even from herself. When she had arrived at Auschwitz and awaited selection, Mengele had looked at her mother’s unlined face, then turned to Eger and asked if this was her “mother” or her “sister”. Eger didn’t think about which word would protect her – she simply told him the truth. Her mother was moved to the other line – the line that led straight to the gas chamber.“Until I returned, I was my own worst enemy,” she says. “I not only had survivor’s guilt, I had survivor’s shame. I didn’t need a Hitler out there, I had a Hitler in me telling me I was unworthy, that I didn’t deserve to survive. On that day, I allowed myself to be human – not superhuman and not subhuman. We do things the way human beings do and we make mistakes. If I had known better, I would have done better – I would have, believe me. But unless we acknowledge that we cannot change the past, we cannot really heal and live life.”Every part of her experience has informed her work. “I studied it and I lived it,” she says. “There is a difference between all the knowledge you get from books and all the clinical experience – both of which I have – and the ‘life experience’. That’s what I use most. I help people realise that the biggest prison is in their mind – and to be free of the past means not to run from it or forget it, but to face it. I see my work as my calling. And I’m still not done.”The Choice by Edith Eger is published by Rider Books, £8.99.

Smitten, they didn’t realise how bad a state it was in. “We naively thought we would just give it a lick of paint,” she says. Little did they know that they were embarking on an epic renovation that entailed replacing the stairwell, the roof and windows as well as reconfiguring the layout at the top and bottom.Today, the entrance hall gives way to a large living room dotted with midcentury design, and an office with the double-sided desk she shares with Peters, a motion graphic designer. On the lower ground floor a sequence of dingy, poky rooms is now a serene open-plan kitchen and dining room overlooking the garden, with a utility and Lilliputian corridor leading to a home recording studio fashioned from the original cellar (“It was full of stalactites”). On the first floor are two comfy guest rooms and a dark-hued bathroom electrified by blue tumbling- block floor tiles. The couple knocked into the eaves to create a cavernous master bedroom, with acres of custom storage that doubles as a room ide, cordoning off their clean-lined Ashton \u0026amp Bentley roll-top bath – and enjoying exceptional views on to the river and rolling hills.So all-consuming was the project, which took more than 18 months in planning alone, that it prompted a fully fledged career change for Chenaï. The former digital strategist has now fulfilled her long-held ambition as an interior decorator. Since she retrained, and launched HCC Interiors four years ago, the house has become a test-site for her whimsical design: “It’s like a laboratory where I get to experiment with ideas,” she says. Her latest projects include a family cottage near Exeter and a custom furniture line made in collaboration with the architectural and design firm Woco, where she’s a part-time interior design consultant. Its first fruit is the elegantly proportioned ghost console (“no legs means less cleaning”) that is sleekly positioned in the hallway.Though the couple’s past life of partying has happily been usurped by decorating and gardening, neither would have imagined that their social lives would actually enjoy an uptick in Totnes. “It’s way more sociable here than it was in London, where people would be so exhausted by the hustle they’d need to go home and rest,” she says. “Here, we see friends all the time and it’s often very spontaneous.”It’s not unusual to congregate for post-work river swims or impromptu dinners at their nearby allotment to share the spoils of the latest crop (right now, it’s courgettes, artichoke flowers and white currants). Central, in interiors terms, to this communal mentality is their west-facing kitchen. “We wanted it to be a very sociable kitchen,” says Chenaï of the space which, like the rest of the house, is decked with vintage artworks and treasures gathered on sourcing trips to Copenhagen, Brussels and the south of France. “Everything has been designed to face outwards, so that when friends come over we can cook and chat.”Much of the artwork is inherited from the portfolio of Peters’s late mother, an amateur artist and keen potter, who taught her craft at a local school. Everything is inventively hung using cleverly upgraded charity-shop frames. Self-portraits sit alongside an eclectic gathering that includes a painterly seaside canvas picked up for €150 near Montpellier, and an otherworldly tapestry by the Danish artist Naja Salto. It’s these touches, together with Chenaï’s evangelical approach to lighting (“It’s decorative and sculptural”) that lends warmth to the cool, monochromatic palette, punctuated by the occasional dash of pink and purple.On the furniture front, Chenaï operated a strict swivel-door policy for everything aside from the vintage twin beds inherited from her French grandmother: “Nothing from our London flat really worked proportionally,” she says. “So we slowly sold to replace on eBay.” The couple’s shared love of sci-fi lends another unexpected sartorial layer. “It’s Tron-meets-Regency,” she posits, gesturing to the spherical shelving that looms over the living room. Stacked with books on everything from English herbs to Thomas Heatherwick, it’s modelled after the futuristic Tyko bookshelf by Italian artist and architect Manfredo Massironi.With the house complete, you get the sense that they’re now ready to fully immerse themselves in the local community. “Our lives have been dominated by DIY for the last few years,” she says. “I’m always tinkering – but there is an end point.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

However, campaigners only have a narrow window in which to secure it.“I’m not saying for a moment that it solves the underlying problem – which is the fact that some people have felt left behind. I think that in many ways, they have.”However, it comes after Theresa May vehemently rules ruled out a second referendum, saying she . She said that she will she would not “give in” to the the demands. “In the Ssummer of 2016, millions came out to have their say,” she May said. “They trusted that their vote would count that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and a betrayal of that trust.”Meanwhile, industry bodies are still demanding clarity on the Brexit talks. The government has been releasing “technical notices” about a no-deal outcome, but there has been little detail on the overall extra costs involved.Some carmakers could face added costs of up to £1bn and inidual some companies in the food and drink sector could face an extra £60m in costs a year under a no-deal outcome, according to analysis by auditors KPMG. The extra bureaucracy, storage and tariff implications could lead to companies in the clothing sector being hit with as much as £15m in extra costs.“Food and drink industry clients face very significant new tariffs on EUUK trade because high common external tariffs on food, as well as high administration costs due to health regulations. Several clients in this sector could see costs rise by up to £60m.”Meanwhile, a new assessment of the costs incurred as a result of customs checks under a no-deal outcome suggest a £2.5bn bill. The assessment by Andrew Meaney, from the Oxera financial economics consultancy, states: “Our analysis of a no-deal Brexit suggests that, even under conservative assumptions around the increase in vehicles to be checked by member states, the costs to hauliers would amount to £2.5bn. None of this analysis includes the further costs associated with delays on surface transport routes to and from ports and railheads.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2b140f63882e7b8894d30858cf563edae29393d/713_432_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91bfec05d609434e69fdc3a10aa948a","title":"corbynites labour rule changes remove mps hard left","story":"Branches seek to dump MPs and accept hard-left activists and expelled membersPlans to make it easier to remove Labour MPs, fast-track the return of expelled members, and accept supporters of hard-left groups are to be unveiled at the party’s conference, the Observer has learned.In a move that will intensify the latest bout of bitter infighting between supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and his critics, local Labour groups from across the country will attempt to overhaul party rules with measures that would hand more power to the membership.Labour’s leadership is now under pressure to kill off the proposals, which threaten to cause renewed anger among MPs and put them at greater risk of deselection.Frank Field, the veteran Birkenhead MP, resigned the party whip last week after complaining of a “culture of nastiness, bullying and intimidation”. He also criticised the party over its handling of the row over antisemitism that has raged all summer. Labour is braced for further resignations this week.On Sunday, the former Labour minister Dame Margaret Hodge launched a fresh attack on Corbyn, accusing the Labour leadership of harbouring a “hatred of Jews”. Hodge, who attends a Jewish Labour Movement conference in London on Sunday with ex-PM Gordon Brown, told the Sunday Times: “All (the leadership) can think about is their internal Labour party and their hatred of Jews … Jeremy has allowed antisemitism and racism to run rife. He needs to renounce much of what he did.”On Saturday, the Labour former home secretary David Blunkett called for “seismic change” and a rethink of the “Corbyn project” in an article for the Daily .MPs are demanding an emergency meeting of the parliamentary party when they return to Westminster. They want assurances that the leadership will get a grip on the crisis and take decisive steps to stop antisemitism.“It is up to the leadership to keep this party together,” said one senior backbencher. “The leadership will end up being the midwife of any new party that emerges if they cannot act to ensure the party stays united.”There is also anger among Labour MPs that senior members of the shadow cabinet have opted not to intervene in the row. “There are several members who have aspirations to replace Jeremy and have shown a total lack of leadership,” said one MP.It is a crucial week for the party. A gathering of its ruling body will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to adopt all of the examples of antisemitism set out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The vast majority of MPs want all the examples to be adopted, but allies of the leader are preparing to add clarifications to them. They fear that free speech about the actions of Israel could be damaged by not doing so.An array of rule changes demanded by Labour’s grassroots membership, which is overwhelmingly supportive of Corbyn’s leadership, are set to be debated and voted on at the party’s conference this month. One of the most contentious proposals, put forward by five local branches, would scrap a rule put in place when the party was fighting the hard-left Militant group in the 1980s. This makes it an expellable offence to “support a political organisation other than an official Labour group”. Party insiders said that scrapping the rule would open Labour membership to people in hard-left political organisations such as the Alliance for Workers’ Liberty.There are eight different rule changes submitted by 13 Labour branches that seek to make it easier to remove sitting MPs. Most of the proposals would scrap the existing system, under which a sitting MP is reselected with a simple majority of local parties and trade union branches. Instead, most demand a full reselection process, with members choosing from a shortlist that would include the sitting MP.Another proposal targets the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has criticised Labour’s handling of the antisemitism row. It envisages his role being split into two, with a woman holding at least one of the new positions.There is also an attempt to accelerate the return of Labour members who have been expelled. Currently, an expelled member cannot reapply for membership for five years. The latest proposed rule change would allow them back in after as little as a year.The party did not wish to comment on how the rule changes would be treated by the leadership. However, sources said the proposals had not yet been discussed by Labour’s ruling national executive committee. While the party may be able to block some of the proposals, others will be stopped only if the local branches involved can be persuaded by the leader’s team to withdraw them.Labour’s leadership is also planning its own reforms to party rules under the “democracy review” carried out by a former Labour MP, Katy Clark. It includes plans to give members more power through e-voting, which could give them a stronger role in deciding policy and internal appointments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2552f19f21e65f28b6a5d4773ec86961ab6413/0_188_4691_2814/master/4691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab7b984987f200ed68009cf5b93c0b4b","title":"sadiq khan balloon takes flight in london","story":"Inflatable makes debut in protest against crime and in response to ‘Baby Trump’A giant balloon depicting London mayor Sadiq Khan scowling in a bikini has taken flight over Parliament Square in Westminster, in an attempt by campaigners to highlight the capital’s rise in violent crime.The nine-metre (29ft) inflatable is a response to the Donald Trump baby balloon that Khan allowed to fly in July, with the campaign organiser Yanny Bruere describing himself as a free-speech advocate.“In light of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the UK, let’s get a ‘Baby Khan’ one and see if free speech applies to all and whether or not Mr Khan and the London assembly will also approve this,” Bruere said on the Crowdfunder page he set up to raise money for the blimp.On Saturday morning, Bruere said he thought many people do not feel represented by Khan. He added: “I think a certain amount of respect should be afforded to the leader of the free world and the greatest ally the UK has – the president of America.”The Crowdfunder page raised more than £59,000 from nearly 3,500 supporters. Katie Hopkins was an early backer, and Fox News and Russia Today have covered the campaign.The original “Baby Khan” idea expressed on the page was replaced in reality with a mature mayor wearing sunshine-yellow swimwear, to reference his vow to ban “body-shaming” advertisements featuring bikini-clad models from the tube.Khan himself seemed bemused by the balloon. “If people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini, they’re welcome to do so. I don’t really think yellow’s my colour though,” he said. City Hall granted the protesters permission to fly the blimp and by Saturday morning nearly 9,000 people had expressed interest on Facebook in going to see it, but far fewer turned up at Parliament Square.“I think it’s very funny,” said Gavin Leonard, a spectator from east London. “I always expected the crowd to be smaller than the Trump crowds – this is a bit of fun.”He added: “I think Sadiq Khan has been a terrible mayor for London. I’ve lived here for 25 years and the feeling of impending crime on the streets has never been worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a00c7f3c96ab5c88007780eef6b956735ef46ebc/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4787da37045fba4ad79cebefb855ea","title":"snp seeks to refocus on policies amid salmond allegations","story":"News comes as SNP activists meet to refocus on policy amid fallout of sexual harassment allegations against ex-leaderAlex Salmond has closed a crowdfunding appeal to fund a judicial review of the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against him after it reached more than double its initial target in less than three days.By Saturday lunchtime, more than 4,100 people had donated a total of £100,000 to Salmond after he launched the appeal on Wednesday evening. The former Scottish National party leader faces a police investigation into the complaints by two female civil servants. One official is reported to have alleged he touched her bottom and breasts at his official residence in Edinburgh while he was first minister. Salmond has repeatedly denied any misconduct.Closing the appeal, Salmond posted a message thanking those who had contributed and stating: “Every penny of surplus funds, which will be substantial in the event of a successful judicial review, will be distributed to good causes in Scotland and beyond.”While a number of senior party figures have questioned why someone with Salmond’s evident resources would require fundraising, and suggested that such a public rallying for a man accused of harassment may deter other women from coming forward with complaints, a handful of SNP MPs and MSPs have donated themselves.Meanwhile the SNP is attempting to refocus on its primary goal of independence after a turbulent week and a warning from its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, that the way the allegations made against Salmond are dealt with “will say a lot about who we are as a party”.Hundred of activists are gathering in Aviemore on Saturday to debate the economic case for independence. At a meeting of SNP parliamentarians on Friday, arranged before the Salmond allegations were made public, Sturgeon said: “How we deal with this and how we are seen to respond to this will say a lot about who we are as a party and also about the country we are today and want to build for the future.“Let’s not forget that at the heart of this, amidst all the focus on process, politics and personalities, there are two people who have brought forward complaints, which cannot have been easy to do. I want to be not just the first minister but also a citizen of a country where people feel that they can come forward and know that their complaints will be taken seriously.“Therefore in everything we do and say, we need to make sure that we are not making it harder for people to come forward in the future. Otherwise we risk setting back so much of the progress that has been made in recent times.”The event in Aviemore is the second of a series of national assemblies set up to discuss the report by the party’s sustainable growth commission, published in May. Party sources downplayed talk of a rift on Saturday morning, insisting that rank-and-file members attending last weekend’s assembly in Ayr had been more interested in talking about currency options than Alex Salmond.The SNP’s deputy leader, Keith Brown, who is facilitating the open-format assemblies, which allow inidual members to offer feedback on all aspects of the report’s economic prospectus for independence as well as how the party conveys its message to voters, said that providing an alternative to Brexit was essential, as voters began to notice mortgages and food prices increasing while job opportunities diminished. The long-awaited growth commission report was intended to offer a more convincing and realistic economic case for independence than the one thought to have scuppered the 2014 campaign. But it attracted a wave of criticism from members of the broader yes movement following its publication earlier this year, in particular for recommendations that an independent Scotland would have to cut spending and delay launching its own currency, leave a newly independent Scotland beholden to the UK’s financial markets.Sturgeon’s cautionary words were echoed by the prominent civil society group Women for Independence, which released a statement on Friday evening urging all media outlets and social media users to be mindful of their responsibilities towards survivors of sexual crimes, saying: “It’s vital that everyone remembers that there are survivors of sexual crimes who are reading and hearing everything that is being played out in the media. Their voices are lost this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e73a050fa3c909209a5a8ae0e686d6f0442512cb/9_47_2604_1562/master/2604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ea1355cb6f374729525493616a0b741","title":"the greatest dancers in british politics ranked","story":"After Theresa May’s eye-catching moves, here’s our ultimate list of dancing British politiciansHaving busted a move not once, but twice, on her recent African trip, the prime minister, Theresa May, has thrown a spotlight on that most enchanting of traditions, British politicians dancing. In honour of her performances, here we present our definitive list of dancing British politicians – ranked.One of the most isive figures in recent British political history, we can at least probably all agree that when called upon to dance in public, the Iron Lady danced passably, if in a slightly uninspired fashion. It seems that occasionally the lady was for turning, although a twirl seemed to have been deemed a step too far.The same could not be said of Neil Kinnock. When not falling over on beaches, Labour’s leader during many of the Thatcher years could sometimes be found starring in pop videos. Here he is, inexplicably making a cameo in the video for My Guy by Tracey Ullman, who equally inexplicably managed to rack up three top 10 hit singles in 1983.At the height of the New Labour years, when not throwing punches, John Prescott could frequently be seen having a dance at Labour party conference. Here he is making shapes alongside a brass band and the Blairs – much, it appears, to the disdain of Gordon Brown lurking in the background.Not so much a dance as a sort of baffled nod and slight sway, ultra-Brexiteer John Redwood’s highlight in office was his attempt to sing along to the Welsh national anthem, and the confused physical motion that went with it.Trailblazer Ann Widdecombe made a Strictly Come Dancing appearance a viable career option for an ex-politician in 2010. She managed to be the lowest-scoring celebrity in seven of the 10 weeks that she lasted in the competition, but the public kept voting her back for more. Her signature move was to essentially lurk at the back of the stage while Anton du Beke tried to distract the judges by actually dancing.The Tory dream ticket, or your worst nightmare? Either way David and Boris appeared as a dancing double act as they joined forces to bop along enthusiastically to the Spice Girls at the 2012 London Olympic closing ceremony.In between resigning in disgrace and reinventing himself as the Welsh Ukip assembly member who likes to hang around with alt-right internet trolls who’ve taught him phrases such as “triggered” and “truly dank memes”, Neil Hamilton had to make a living. And at one point he made that living by dancing on TV in a glass box for Johnny Vegas while someone poured a bucket of fish over him.Ed Balls woke up on 7 May 2015 hoping by the end of the night to be chancellor of the exchequer. Instead, by the end of the night he was no longer an MP and just 16 months away from being Strictly Come Dancing’s novelty political contestant. Who can forget the sight of the former shadow chancellor dancing to Gangnam Style on the nation’s television sets? But probably his finest hour was an exquisitely camp salsa, while dressed as The Mask. Dance partner Katya Jones maintained her grace throughout the 10 weeks Ed survived on the show.We have to hand top spot to Theresa. She went to Africa to boost post-Brexit British exports, and exported a whole load of dance memes. Since she first danced at a South African school, the video clip has been posted thousands of times on social media. Post-punk band Killing Joke even made a version soundtracked with their I Am The Virus single, and it has been re-cut by others, in honour of her Maybot reputation, so that she’s dancing to Kraftwerk’s The Robots. Congratulations, Theresa May. And maybe we’ll eventually get to see her on Strictly once she’s had enough of trying to steer the country through Brexit …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5689cc389a1054010b0b6d9bdb7e031368d9eed3/445_551_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e5c46b7fd9ef287ca58a4be15848a54","title":"fernando alonso thinks hes god kevin magnussen","story":"Haas’s Kevin Magnussen launched a scathing attack on Fernando Alonso after the pair tangled in qualifying at Monza. The McLaren driver had attempted to repass Magnussen at turn one during Q2 and in doing so both their laps were compromised.“He thought he could overtake into turn one, but I’d rather hang myself,” said Magnussen. “I’m not going to let him past me and sacrifice my own lap. No way. He thinks he’s God, but no way.”Alonso had been going slowly on his warm-up lap and Magnussen had passed him on the run to Parabolica, but rather than backing off to create a gap, the Spaniard then caught him at the end of the straight and attempted to pass round the outside through the Rettifilo chicane. Alonso had to ride the kerbs and Magnussen had to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Both drivers failed to get out of Q2 as a result. Alonso, who will leave F1 after this season, laughed at the time, saying: “Magnussen wants to race,” and went further afterwards.Magnussen said: “He came to me after qualifying and laughed to my face. Just outright disrespectful. I can’t wait for him to retire. I think we know Fernando is a bit of an opportunist. We’ve seen that quite a few times in his career with his teams as well, trying different things. Didn’t always work out and it didn’t work out today. He talks about his laps being ine and what not, he literally thinks he’s a god. It’s quite amusing.”Zak Brown, McLaren’s CEO, confronted the Haas team principal, Guenther Steiner, in the pit lane afterwards. Alonso said he had no comment on Magnussen’s words but he did put his side of the incident. “At the last moment inside the Parabolica he decided to fill the gap I was opening with the car in front and we started the lap together,” he said. “You arrive into turn one together and it was not a very clever move.” The stewards investigated but chose to take no action on the incident."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae691889394de812387e31ce76930a1f7b6b1d0/0_109_2868_1720/master/2868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9762f345d62d3466b6c085fb1ed052a","title":"jos buttler england india fourth test","story":"• Fourth Test day three: England 246 \u0026amp 260-8 India 273• Jos Buttler hits 69 to push England to a 233-run leadSaturday is traditionally moving day but no one moved very quickly on the neat green turf here. This did not diminish the entertainment –there was tension in abundance. For England fans, every single was a treasure, a boundary was like gold dust, a wicket a minor calamity.India offered no free gifts they were fiercely disciplined, yet patient on a surface that was never entirely reliable but had lost some of its pace. Moreover, there are few more holes emerging for the spinners to aim at. India had to earn most, though not all, of their wickets. Oddly enough, their free gifts came in the form of Yorkshiremen – and crucial scalps they were.The match remains deliciously in the balance. Jos Buttler, unexpectedly England’s highest Test run-scorer in the summer of 2018, contributed a vital 69 when the innings was threatening to subside. This enabled England to be 260 for eight at the close, a lead of 233. There was also a polished 48 from Joe Root plus gritty knocks from Keaton Jennings and Ben Stokes and another little gem from Sam Curran. So Sunday’s play should be a treat.Run-scoring was seldom easy and that was certainly the case for the openers. As ever, Alastair Cook looked more out of runs than out of form before edging into the increasingly more reliable hands of KL Rahul at second slip. How would Root cope with yet another early dismissal? We would have to wait a while to find out because, to mild consternation, Moeen Ali came out at No 3.One suspects that Moeen would happily sweep the dressing rooms after play before driving the team bus home if asked to do so – it is odd that he does not get plonked at short leg in this team.He will do whatever is required of him. He may well have wanted to bat at No 3 in the longer term, he would probably welcome the role on a more permanent basis. But it was a surprise to see him.The ploy did not work but this does not mean it was a bad one. Cricketers are naturally conservative and often superstitious. They like order and routine but there is nothing wrong in being flexible in the middle of the game. It is to Moeen’s credit that he undertook a task that is currently something of a poisoned chalice. On this occasion he edged against Ishant Sharma on nine and Rahul took an even better catch.Now Root appeared and he and Jennings dug in until just before lunch. They were watchful, though. Jennings did manage to take 10 runs from a Ravichandran Ashwin over with a variety of sweep shots. But in the final over of the session he was taken on the pad when facing Mohammed Shami and against his better judgment he was persuaded by Root to review the decision, a wasteful piece of advice.Just over 40 minutes later, Shami’s next delivery was propelled at Jonny Bairstow, restored to his favourite position at No 5, and he missed it. The ball sailed between bat and pad as Bairstow attempted a drive and he walked off briskly without bothering to survey the damage. One hopes Bairstow does not enter a mindset that tells him he cannot score runs for England unless he is the wicketkeeper.Stokes, blocking resolutely as usual, eked out another 30 runs alongside Root, who found it much simpler to get off strike. Eventually, Stokes played one impish shot, shimmying down the pitch to Sharma and punching a straight drive to the boundary. Next ball he summoned Root for a single after driving the ball straight to mid-on it was a poor call by Stokes aggravated by poor running from Root, who failed to e for home and was beaten by Shami’s throw. Root, who had batted gutsily for his 48, joined Cheteshwar Pujara as the only Test batsmen to be run out twice this year.Buttler, like Root, found run-scoring less of a problem than Stokes as they sought to repair the innings. For the moment, the Botham comparisons for Stokes are in abeyance he has become the Barnacle, the modern-day Trevor Bailey batting as if there is currently crisis or, at the very least, an imminent one. In some ways, his self-denial is admirable since this quality has been in short supply in England’s lineup and his efforts were valuable to the cause. However, he is not batting naturally and this diminishes him at the crease, which was highlighted by his dismissal. The final ball of his vigil came from Ashwin it was a half-volley, which he prodded at defensively and it ended up in the safe hands of Ajinkya Rahane at slip.Sam Curran joined Buttler and he had no qualms about batting naturally. For the first time in the day, runs came freely throughout his innings, Buttler had been alert to every scoring opportunity while continuing to bat in red-ball mode. But on 69 he fell to the new ball, lbw to Sharma when aiming to drive on the leg side.Curran remained positively impish and in the final half-hour his partnership with Adil Rashid was worth 27 runs, but as Rashid edged the last ball of the day to the keeper, the pendulum had swung once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32e6363eca872dea7a36e620e089972dd4125dfb/0_11_2236_1342/master/2236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d60342ae4a73b48b2ebe18026566c240","title":"novak djokovic richard gasquet live us open","story":"That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back tomorrow for more live coverage from Flushing Meadows!Here’s a look at the final stats from tonight’s match. Gasquet committed nearly twice as many unforced errors (47) as Djokovic (25).“It was a great match from the beginning to the end,” Djokovic says during his on-court interview with ESPN’s Brad Gilbert. “I thought I played really, really well, especially from the backhand corner. I was managing to step in and dictate the play from that area of the court.”He’s asked about his opponent in Monday’s fourth-round match: Portugal’s João Sousa, who upset Lucas Pouille earlier today.Gasquet quickly falls behind 15-40, giving Djokovic a pair of match points. He saves the first with an overhand smash, then the second with a gorgeous drop shot. A backhand down the line gives him game point, but moments later Djokovic has a third match point. And fittingly Djokovic wins it with a backhand winner down the line, finishing off Gasquet after 2hr 11min. Gasquet holds but the end, it seems, is nigh.A glimmer of hope for Gasquet as Djokovic double-faults to fall behind 15-30 on his serve. Moments later he’s earned his first break-point chance in what feels like a lifetime, but he squanders it when a backhand goes sailing. He wins the next point for a second break point and Djokovic saves it with a truly spectacular defensive effort, an extended all-court rally that ends when Gasquet sends and overhead smash into the net. Deuce, after a standing ovation. Moments later Djokovic has held. Some jaw-dropping shotmaking from both players in that game. Time running out for Gasquet to nab that necessary break.A couple loose points from Gasquet on his serve and he’s down love-30. He responds with a beautifully struck cross-court forehand winner followed by a 112mph ace for 30-all, but Djokovic counters with a blistering forehand winner of his own for a break point. And he converts it when Gasquet dumps another shot into the net.The unforced errors continue to pile up for Gasquet, not that Djokovic needs the help the way he’s been serving. Another easy hold for the Serbian. Gasquet shows nice resistance as he rattles off three quick points to hold from 15-30 down, but can he make any headway on Djokovic’s serve?Djokovic caps a love hold with a scintillating backhand down the line. Hard to imagine Gasquet finding a way back into this match as long as the Wimbledon champions keeps up this form. Gasquet opens with an easy hold, capping it with a 119mph ace, his seventh of the match.Potentially big moment for Gasquet, who wins a point off a chip and charge for 30-all. He’s 9-for-11 on net approaches. Why not try it more? But Gasquet frames a return badly and Djokovic has a set point. And Djokovic indeed takes the set when Gasquet nets a backhand early in a rally, his 25th unforced error of the set compared to nine winners.Gasquet shows off some clever shotmaking and runs out to a 40-15 lead, but Djokovic rattles off a pair of points for deuce. Gasquet hits a 124mph ace, his sixth of the night, for game point, then Djokovic gets a little casual at the net and misfires on a volley. Now Djokovic will try to serve out the set. A half-chance for Gasquet as Djokovic falls behind 15-30 on his serve. But Gasquet nets shots from the baseline on the next three points and Djokovic holds. The Frenchman will serve to stay in the second set after the break.Gasquet coming to net a little more often and finding success there. He races to 40-15, but follows with a pair of unforced errors for deuce. Moments later Djokovic has a break-point chance, but squanders it when he sends a backhand sailing past the baseline. Gasquet follows with a 112mph ace, then Djokovic misses a cheeky drop shot from the baseline and Gasquet holds.Gasquet is able to get to 30-all on Djokovic’s serve, but Djokovic crushes an unreturnable serve then Gasquet dumps a backhand into the net. Another mostly stress-free hold for Djokovic.Gasquet holds comfortably despite a double fault, aided but a couple of Djokovic errors. He’s on the board in the second set and still only trailing by the break.Djokovic falls behind love-30 but Gasquet accommodates with a pair of unforced errors for 30-all. Djokovic then rips a winner, pumping his fist in jubilation. He goes down the line with a backhand on the next point but finally misses one. Deuce. Djokovic then hits a lunging volley winner followed by an overhand smash winner and he’s consolodated the break.Three quick points for Djokovic on Gasquet’s serve and he’s got three break points, but he needs only the first of them as Gasquet makes another unforced error. Djokovic has broken at love and won all eight points of the set so far.This is as good as it gets. Every element of Djokovic’s game is clicking and Gasquet has no answers at the moment. The Serbian holds at love in the opening game of the second set.Djokovic wins the first point with a searing backhand, but Gasquet crushes an ace for 15-all. Gasquet hits another winner then nets a forehand for 30-all. Djokovic sends a forehand flying past the baseline, follows it with a brilliantly disguised flop-shot winner struck from a foot behind the baseline. Deuce. Djokovic then runs Gasquet ragged from corner to corner during a lengthy rally before hitting a smash winner to set up a break point that’s also a set point. What follows is the point of the night so far, a hyper-athletic extended rally which ends when Djokovic plays a drop shot that Gasquet somehow managed to recover for a passing winner. Simply brilliant. But Djokovic wins the next point and follows it with a winner to take the set after 38 minutes!Djokovic opens with a winner, his 12th of the night already (compared to Gasquet’s two). The Frenchman then dumps a backhand into the net from the baseline and sends a forehand flying for 40-love. Djokovic makes an error on the next point, then attempts a lob winner that falls inches past the baseline. 40-30. But Djokovic wins the next point and holds serve. Gasquet will serve to stay in the first set after the changeover.Gasquet stems the tide with a tidy service game, racing ahead to 40-love and crushing a 124mph ace for the love hold. Djokovic hits a winner followed by a 119mph ace, then Gasquet sends a backhand wide and nets a forehand from the baseline. It’s another love hold for Djokovic, who’s won the last 12 points.Gasquet falls behind love-30 on his serve and Djokovic has won the last six points. A vicious cross-court forehand that wrong-foots Gasquet makes it seven and gives him triple break point. Djokovic needs only one and he’s broken Gasquet at love.Djokovic holds at love in under a minute, capping it with back-to-back 114mph aces.Gasquet falls behind 15-30, then sprays a one-handed backhand wide to give Djokovic a pair of break-point chances. He saves the first with a 119mph ace down the middle, then the second when he’s forced into an error. Djokovic then hits a backhand winner down the line for a third break point, but nets a backhand on the following point for deuce. Moments later Gasquet holds. Gasquet won the toss and chose to receive. Djokovic starts it off with a powerful forehand winner from just inside the baseline after a medium-length baseline rally. Gasquet comes to net on the next point and Djokovic tries to pass him but sends it long for 15-all. Djokovic then double-faults, but Gasquet sends a backhand sailing on the following point for 30-all. NowDjokovic misses another backhand for 30-40 and Gasquet has a break-point chance in the opening game, but Djokovic saves it with a goregrous backhand winner down the line. They trade errors and moments later Gasquet has another break-point opportunity, but Djokovic erases it with a deep, penetrating forehand that whizzes past a late Gasquet. Two quick points for Djokovic and he escapes with the hold. An eight-minute opening service game to start things off.Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for tonight’s third-round match between Novak Djokovic and Richard Gasquet. It’s been a fairly one-sided series between these guys down the years with Djokovic having won 12 of their 13 meetings on tour, including the last 10 in succession.

Others hope it will spark a more nuanced discussion.“The consciences are waking,” Asia Argento told the  last November, six weeks after she publicly accused Harvey Weinstein of rape. “Every time one of these pigs fall, it’s a badge of honour. What I see is that this is like an avalanche.”Argento’s visions were accurate it has been almost a year since the Italian actor and director spoke out about Weinstein and her accusations against one of the most powerful men in entertainment have been instrumental in setting in motion an avalanche of accusations of sexual impropriety. But now, this avalanche has enveloped Argento herself. On 19 August the New York Times reported that Argento had paid $380,000 to settle a complaint filed against her by Jimmy Bennett, a musician and actor, who said she sexually assaulted him when he was 17 and she was 37. The age of consent in California, where the assault allegedly took place, is 18. Argento had known Bennett since he was 7, when she’d played his mother in the movie The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things.After the Times broke the story, Argento admitted to paying Bennet but asserted that she had “never had any sexual relationship” with him. Argento claimed that Bennet’s assault claims stemmed from “severe economic problems” the young actor was facing she further stated that her then-boyfriend, the celebrity chef and TV presenter Anthony Bourdain, who killed himself in June, had encouraged her to pay Bennett off, to avoid bad publicity.The allegationshave sent shockwaves through the media, and been seized upon with relish by detractors of #MeToo. An attorney for Weinstein, for example, quickly put out a statement criticizing Argento’s “stunning level of hypocrisy”.The accusations have also caused a rift between Argento and Rose McGowan, another high-profile face of #MeToo. McGowan was quick to distance herself from the disgraced actor. Shortly after the news about Argento broke, she posted on Twitter: “I got to know Asia Argento ten months ago. Our commonality is the shared pain of being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. My heart is broken. I will continue my work on behalf of victims everywhere.”In recent days, it has also been revealed that McGowan’s partner, the model Rain Dove, had received text messages from Argento, in which the actor admitted to sleeping with Bennett and said that she had been receiving unsolicited nude photos from Bennett since he was 12 years old.While there are those who have leveraged the Argento allegations to discredit #MeToo, others have viewed it as an opportunity to advance the narrative around sexual violence. After the story first broke, Tarana Burke, the activist who first launched the #MeToo moment, back in 2006, stated on Twitter that “I’ve said repeatedly that the #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward.”Burke stated that “It will continue to be jarring when we hear the names of some of our faves connected to sexual violence unless we shift from talking about iniduals...and begin to talk about power. Sexual violence is about power and privilege.” She further emphasized that, for #MeToo to progress, we must all become “comfortable with the uncomfortable reality that there is no one way to be a perpetrator ... and there is no model survivor”.Speaking to the , Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, stressed that many people who have been impacted by sexual violence don’t feel that they embody what it means to be a ‘perfect victim’, which stops them coming forward about their experiences. Palumbo believes the conversation around Argento has the potential to advance the understanding that someone can be both a victim and a perpetrator.Steven Thrasher, a journalist and future Northwestern university professor, notes that the Black Lives Matter movement has done important work in rejecting the dangerous myth of a ‘perfect victim’ the idea that you had to be angelic to deserve empathy. Thrasher observes that “Black Lives Matter rallied around us as complex humans.” By contrast, the media response to the Argento accusations, he says, seem like a “reactionary throwback”.Over the past couple of weeks, there has been much discussion about whether the accusations against Argento will have an impact on the wider #MeToo movement. That this question is even being asked has irritated some people, who worry that privileged white Hollywood voices like Argento’s and McGowan’s have hijacked years of under acknowledged work, by black feminist activists.Lexi Alexander, an Oscar-nominated Arab-German film and television director, told the  she believes Argento’s fall from grace “won’t derail the original #MeToo movement created by Tarana Burke. As for #MeToo the Hollywood version, those of us who have been outspoken about toxic issues plaguing Hollywood before the Weinstein scandal broke knew all along that this would be a fickle endeavor. We were watching from the sidelines as longtime enablers of sexual misconduct suddenly jumped on the bandwagon and certain celebrities pushed themselves into the limelight.”The acclaimed women’s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing one of Weinstein’s accusers, also believes that the current conversation around Argento will not harm #MeToo. When the accusations against Weinstein broke last year, Allred says, victims of sexual violence were energized and empowered in a way she hasn’t seen before in her 44 years of practice. “The movement is bigger than Asia Argento,” Allred said. “It will go on and it will grow in size. It will become more powerful than ever. There are many more names that will come out. I know where many of the skeletons are buried, to use the cliché. It’s only a matter of time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1facfe105cef4018392562456a2bd3fa189d821/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c26d77adaffeeabce3e1b98a341be6","title":"saudi arabia may dig canal to turn qatar into an island","story":"Plan takes shape amid bitter dispute that led the Saudis, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to cut ties with small peninsula nation A Saudi official hinted on Friday the kingdom was moving forward with a plan to dig a canal that would turn the neighbouring Qatari peninsula into an island, amid a diplomatic feud between the Gulf nations.“I am impatiently waiting for details on the implementation of the Salwa island project, a great, historic project that will change the geography of the region,” Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said on Twitter.The plan, which would physically separate the Qatari peninsula from the Saudi mainland, is the latest stress point in a fractious 14-month long dispute between the two states.Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being too close to Riyadh’s arch rival, Iran – charges Doha denies.In April the pro-government Sabq news website reported government plans to build a channel 60km long and 200m wide stretching across Saudi Arabia’s border with Qatar.Part of the canal, which would cost up to 2.8 billion riyals ($750m), would be reserved for a nuclear waste facility, it said.Five unnamed companies that specialised in digging canals had been invited to bid for the project and the winner would be announced in September, Makkah newspaper reported in June.Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment and there was no immediate reaction on the plan from Qatar.After the dispute erupted last year, Qatar – a small peninsula nation – found its only land border closed, its state-owned airline barred from using its neighbours’ airspace and Qatari residents expelled from the boycotting countries.Mediation efforts led by Kuwait and the US, which has its largest Middle East air base in Qatar, have failed to resolve the dispute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1f8d17f246600aeae7272deed3c0847d8e4b1d9/0_162_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c7530301509df5fa7c8c239e797634","title":"irish electro music storms british club scene","story":"Wave of liberalism inspires electro scene that is now conquering Britain’s dancefloorsFrom Celtic reels to the Cranberries, and Val Doonican to the Pogues, Irish music has long found fame in Britain. Now a new wave of acts from the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland are taking over the British dance scene – this time with electronic music.The new sounds are rooted in folk music as well as club bangers. Many names will be unfamiliar, such as producer J Colleran from Co Kildare, Dublin’s Seán Mac Erlaine and Galway’s Olan Monk. But there are higher-profile acts, like Bicep of Belfast, who have had millions of streams on YouTube, and Dublin’s Krystal Klear, whose Neutron Dance is of the year’s biggest dance singles.“The electronic music scene in Ireland is massively having a moment,” says Tiarnan McMorrow, one half of DJ duo Brame \u0026amp Hamo from Sligo, whose track Roy Keane has been a huge hit this summer. “It’s become a hotspot for producers, DJs and festivals in the past four or five years. Everybody is getting behind it.”Colleran (the J stands for Jack) says: “Music in Ireland is thriving. Collectives and labels are bringing like-minded people together and they are forming communities to react to what’s going on politically. It’s definitely a very inspiring time.” Others think the energy is partly due to licensing laws. Unlike the 24-hour club cultures in London, Berlin and Amsterdam, many venues are forced to close early. “We have to finish at 2.30am here so there is no time to waste. The night always ends on an absolute high. It is great to have unlimited opening hours, but it is also amazing to leave everyone wanting more,” says McMorrow. The scene is attracting international attention. Spanish dance music empire Elrow will soon expand into the country, and the rise of sell-out festivals, such as Electric Picnic in Stradbally, which took place this weekend, Belfast’s AVA and Forbidden Fruit in Dublin, is making it a touring destination, with local acts benefiting. “Big breakthroughs DJs, like Denis Sulta and Mall Grab, are purposefully touring Irish cities outside the obvious ones,” says Gabriel Szatan, writer for Red Bull Music Academy. Olan O’Brien, the owner of All City Records in Dublin, thinks the boom is a result of the local talent pushing through.“It comes down to collectives like Gash, Room For Rebellion and Club Comfort bringing open-minded platforms and a choice of parties to go to.”Social media and music-streaming platforms have also helped connect artists and attract new fans. “Since the development of computer software, new music no longer takes years and years to come up and artists don’t have to leave in order to become successful,” says Jon Wozencroft, senior tutor in sound and visual communication at the Royal College of Art. “Irish artists are benefiting from the fact that you don’t need expensive equipment or a record company to disseminate your work, you can do it yourself.”But Will Rolfe, founder of Forbidden Fruit, says the success is ultimately down to the Irish character: “Irish people go pretty full on in every aspect and they do it in a joyful way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Road at the scene of the incident on the N24 between Clonmel and Carrick on Suir is closedGood news for those attending Electric Picnic and All Ireland senior football finalT\u0026aacutenaiste tweets that US president always welcome shortly before criticising his policy on PalestinePedestrian pronounced dead at scene at Greagharue on the Bailieboro to Kells Road\u0026lsquoIt was robust\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash eight survivors of clerical abuse met the pope at papal nuncio\u0026rsquos homeDevelopers chasing profits as locals forced to move out of area, say community groupsNew Garda commissioner\u0026rsquos ties with British intelligence services while in PSNI criticisedRabb and Barnier meet in Brussels but no agreement how Border might workUS president will \u0026lsquorenew the deep and historic ties between our two nations\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos an attack on the press, everybody should realise,\u0026rsquo Barry McCaffrey said outside police stationClare councillor says visit will be \u0026lsquogreat boost for the West of Ireland\u0026rsquoMore than 20 headstones were damaged at Bluebell cemeteryHundreds of thousands see no need, feel they lack skills or live in area not linked to webBusinesses and schools to open and close in darkness for months if EU ends clock changeTeenager released without charge after being arrested over delivery of cannabis herb\u0026lsquoNeither I nor anyone in the firm was aware that any such submission was being made\u0026rsquo, said main planning advisor to Pat McDonaghMan is arrested after drugs are discovered during Garda search in Inchicore"},{"url":null,"title":"how cool is dublin s newest garda station","story":"  August 30, 2018Minister insists incoming Garda chief will bring experience and expertise to force   August 30, 2018Minister thanks \u0026Oacute Cual\u0026aacutein for \u0026lsquosteady\u0026rsquo service to the State at opening of new Garda station "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615479.1535815973!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rt%C3%A9 journalist is fastest male finisher in 99th liffey swim","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRTÉ sports journalist Paul O’Flynn was the winner of the men’s event at the 99th Liffey Swim in Dublin on Saturday.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAPA Brexit deal must be signed by “November at the latest”, the EU’s chief negotiator has warned. Michel Barnier told a press conference in Brussels there will be no agreement unless an operational “backstop” arrangement for the Irish Border can be agreed. In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain. But he said was “determined” to reach an agreement ahead of the October deadline, though he said there would be “flexibility” for further negotiations. Standing alongside UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, he said: “Week after week and step by step we are eliminating subjects, bones of contention... I’m determined, we’re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite and Dominic and I think it’s possible to reach that in October.” Mr Barnier added: “If you take account of the date chosen by the United Kingdom to leave, that’s March 29 which is in UK law and you simply count backwards the time that you need for ratification about three months here or there then it takes you to November at the latest. “It’s as simple as that.” It follows concerns that a deal may fail to materialise before the deadline. Mr Raab said that he wanted to continue “accelerating and intensifying” negotiations, adding: “We’re committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.” Earlier, Mr Barnier said a backstop is “essential to conclude the negotiations”, stating: “With no backstop there will be no agreement.” He described the issue as a “matter of some urgency”, adding that he had asked the Brexit Secretary to provide data on how the “necessary controls and checks take place”. British prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will refuse to contemplate any backstop deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole. Mr Raab said the government “remained committed” to finding a solution in Northern Ireland. He said: “On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he’s raised and continuing to drive that forward. “The solutions must be workable, they’ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.” Mr Barnier also told media in Brussels that the future partnership between the EU and UK would be without precedent. He said: “If we achieve what was in the March guidelines then you really do have a partnership with no precedent, this a very ambitious free trade agreement, specific agreements in all sorts of area of common interest.” Mr Barnier was later asked if he believed the Conservative Party Conference would have an impact on negotiations, he said: “I’m not going to comment on the internal political life on the UK, conferences of this party or that party. “We’re negotiating with Theresa May’s Government with Dominic Raab and his team and they’re the ones round the negotiating table.” –PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3614338.1535738680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exploring the border a frontier marked by myriad crossings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Monaghan Way, near the border with south Armagh. Ninety-five of the Border’s 208 crossings are between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh.There are more than twice as many border crossings in Co Monaghan alone as there are between Norway and Sweden, an international boundary much beloved of simplifying Brexiteers.If you include unmapped routes – sometimes no more than planks across a stream – Monaghan may even give the European Union’s entire eastern frontier a run for its money.When civil servants from Northern Ireland and the Republic finally agreed an estimate of the Border’s total number of crossings earlier this summer, a century after partition, the count came to 208, or one for every 2½ kilometres.Almost half – 95 – were between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh. The figure dwarfed even the 59 counted for Donegal, and made the borders of Louth (33 crossings), Cavan (15) and Leitrim (six) seem unperforated by comparison.The Brexit-enforced task of counting them was described by officials as “almost impossible” because of confusions between public and private land, places where the Border runs up the middle of roads, and other anomalies. And there is no better place to see what the counters were up against than on the route between Cavan and Clones, where my own exploration of the Border began.Over a distance of 12km, you cross the frontier four times. But that’s only on the main road, the N54 (as it is in the Republic) and A3 (as it becomes on its brief visits north). Turn off this on to the many side roads to your left and right and you enter a maze that must keep bureaucrats and other lovers of order awake at night.Not long after I met the A3 for the first time, another interesting statistic appeared beside a gateway. “Do not cross this field unless you can do it in nine seconds,” read the warning notice, “because the bull can do it in 10!” There was no sign of the bull, although inviting as the field looked, with the river Finn meandering through it, I wasn’t tempted.A little farther on, in an unintended joke, services offered by a local business included “alignment” – the buzzword of Britain’s torturous Brexit negotiations. In this case, it was only car tyres they were offering to align.And, as a tourist on foot, my main concern with tyres was not getting run over by the traffic that hurls along here at, or over, the speed limits (80kmh in the Republic, 60mph – 96.5kmh – in the North, and both irrelevant to some drivers). Already, however, I was approaching the notorious Drummully salient, perhaps the single greatest challenge to cross-Border alignment, and happy for the excuse it gave to leave the main road.Like the hundreds of local townlands that share the prefix, Drummully gets its name partly via the Irish droim (“ridge”), from the drumlin belt that stretches across Ireland at this latitude. The proliferation of such Drums in south Ulster suggests marching – a connection Drumcree helped perpetuate. And there has indeed been a long-established tendency to mark territory in these parts.Just east of Drummully is a place with the even more martial name of Drumswords, where in 1828, in an incident known as “the rising of Burke”, an Orangemen of local infamy was hanged posthumously from a tree, several days after he had been buried in the local cemetery. But even allowing for the depth of political enmities around here, how Drummully ever became an international frontier is one of the deeper mysteries of partition.Sometimes also referred to as a “polyp” by map-makers, the area is a virtual exclave of Monaghan, all but surrounded by Fermanagh. The connecting isthmus is only metres wide: that sprinting bull could probably cross it in 10 seconds too. But there is no road into Drummully at the connecting point.On the contrary, direct entry from the Republic is cut off by the aforementioned river Finn, which uniformed gardaí have sometimes had to wade across to avoid the complications of road-based approaches, all of which pass through the North.Peter Leary, Fermanagh-born author of Unapproved Routes: Histories of the Irish Border 1922-1972, suggests Drummully was “almost certainly a ballybetagh”: an ancient unit of territory usually comprising 16 townlands. And however it ended up in Monaghan – almost but not quite gripped by two Fermanagh claws, like one of those toys in the amusement arcade game – it was clearly never designed to withstand the stresses of international border duty.Post-partition, farmers inside it suddenly had to cross the frontier twice en route to market in Clones, and the same on the way back. This was complicated even before the Northern authorities started cratering and “spiking” roads to block terror attacks. Meanwhile, the Church of Ireland in Drummully was now separated from its rectory by the Border, and in the confusion, for years, marriages went unregistered in Dublin.Regardless of personal affiliations, sane people on both sides of the political ide thought that either Drummully would have to be sent north by the 1924 Boundary Commission, or that the surrounding northern bits would go south. The commission took a long look at the area. Then events intervened, and the entire Border stayed where it was.So today, although the drumlins, hedgerows and even the road markings offer no clue of a change in jurisdictions, signs on the A3 suddenly welcome visitors in English, Irish and six other languages, including Polish, Japanese and Ulster Scots.These have been joined more recently by Brexit-inspired posters, including one erected by the 1916 Societies: “Hard Border? Soft Border? No Border!” Apart from those, the main road’s surest indication that you have crossed jurisdictions is a shop advertising “fireworks”, sale of which is illegal in the Republic.But even clues such as this disappear when you plunge into the network of boreens south of the N54. There, only the all-knowing blue dot on your iPhone map knows for sure which side of the Border you are, although once, when I thought I was in the North, I was surprised to encounter an old green post box, embedded in the pier of a farmhouse gate. The post box didn’t have a painted-over red crown. It was one of those rarities, with a harp: placed here after this bucolic backwater found itself promoted to frontier duties.Otherwise, speaking of backwaters, water is often the best guide to the Border’s whereabouts, even if this year’s long, hot summer had reduced some of the boundary streams to the status of underground rumour. But somewhere deep in Drummully the road I was on wound its way up to a dramatically humped-back bridge, with sturdy stone walls either side. And although the Border was nudging us from both east and west at this point, the blue dot on my phone placed me firmly in between, in the Republic.So what was this momentous-looking bridge in the middle of nowhere, with no water underneath and surrounded by dense vegetation? As I realised only subsequently, it must have been a ghost of the old Clones-Cavan railway line, long abandoned and now being reclaimed by nature.Back on the main road, much later, and after another brief and uneventful sojourn in the UK, I reached the outskirts of Clones, where a house bedecked with three different flags – the white and blue of Monaghan GAA, the Irish Tricolour and the green, red and black of Palestine – seemed to suggest we were in the Republic again.But no, not quite yet, according to the blue dot. The flags must have been erected by an exile living in what he or she might have called the “occupied territories”. For Clones too is hemmed in by the Border, which crowds it from three sides, with historically ruinous results for the local economy.Then, just north of the town, for reasons best known to itself, the boundary goes wandering once more, into a drunken S-shape, so that again you cross it several times in quick succession. While trying to make sense of its movements there, I noticed a young man get out of a car, set up a camera tripod in the middle of the road and take pictures of the tarmac.“Are you by any chance photographing the Border?” I asked him.And sure enough, he was, as a project for the Glasgow School of Art. We agreed the route was especially illogical around here. But there wasn’t much time to talk. He was a young man in a hurry, with many crossings still to photograph. I passed him again up the road, where he had already shot another piece of tarmac and was packing up the tripod once more before speeding away to the next rendezvous.By now, the fanciful notion I had started with – that this summer, in instalments, I might walk the entire Monaghan frontier – had vanished in the face of its awe-inspiring vastness.There were too many crisis-crossing detours, even on the official routes, not to mind such paths as the one Clones writer Eugene McCabe cut through a field once and called the “Khyber Pass” (as mentioned in another recent book, Hard Border – Walking Through a Century of Irish Partition, by McCabe’s nephew Darach MacDonald).So I left the hilly fastnesses of north Monaghan, Emyvale, Glaslough and Peter Robinson’s road to Clontibret for another time and instead, for the second day of rambling, crossed the county to the Border’s most southerly land extreme, near the village of Blackstaff.There’s not much to Blackstaff these days. But in the years before the 1798 rebellion, according to Samuel Lewis’s Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), it comprised “200 wretched hovels”, whose population elected a “mayor” annually to settle disputes. Even when the hamlet was “broken up”, after 1798, natives continued to hold annual reunions there for many years.Now it’s a quiet gateway into south Armagh, formerly known as “Bandit Country”. And if Jacob Rees-Mogg ever needs a crash course in Border studies, this might be the section I would bring him to, if only for the dog I met soon after crossing into Armagh.The old adage about letting sleeping canines lie was more than usually feasible during the hot weather. I tiptoed past several farmyards where watchdogs slumbered. Elsewhere I was grateful that, thanks to sheep and litigation, the more active ones are less likely to roam freely than dogs of 30 or 40 years ago.But this particular animal, of indeterminate breed, had been fitted with a muzzle. He was thereby at liberty to come out on to the road to growl at me, as I walked by. So muzzle or no muzzle, I passed gingerly, complimenting him on being an “excellent metaphor” for the fragility of the peace process. He kept growling until I was well clear of the property.There were more direct reminders than the dog of the Troubles here, including some elaborate roadside monuments to the Republican fallen. Their inscriptions can be elliptical. One on the Annaghad Road speaks of an IRA volunteer who simply “died near this spot” in 1996. Another at Cullaville commemorates an IRA man who, in contrast, was “murdered by criminals”.I was on the main road to Castleblayney then, still known as the “concession road” from its unusual legal status after partition. When the Border first descended, and customs officers wrestled with the challenges of one of world’s most dense rural road networks, it was decreed that only 16 crossings were “approved” for general use.The vast majority were “unapproved”, except for local farmers, doctors on call, people on foot or bicycles, and sometimes funerals (an exemption often said to have been exploited by smugglers). The “concession” roads, linking two parts of a jurisdiction but passing through the other, could be used for transit as long as drivers didn’t stop.But as Peter Leary reminds us, natives of Cullaville, being from Armagh, and wishing to travel the short distance northwest to ’Blayney in Monaghan, were legally expected to take the opposite direction, to Crossmaglen, then south into Louth, then double around on to the concession road, on which they too were required not to stop, even in their home village. The detour was about 45km. It was understandably unpopular, and gave way under mass protests in the 1960s.The concession road is another scary place to walk these days, thanks to traffic. So it was a relief to get off it again and follow the Border up along the shores of Lough Ross, itself a cross-Border body of water. Here you can abandon roads altogether for a while, thanks to one of Ireland’s lesser-known tourist attractions: the Monaghan Way.But the Border gets back to business, in every sense, when the L4400 meets the main Castleblayney-Crossmaglen Road. The actual boundary involved a short detour to my right there, and as usual was barely recognisable now except for a patch of tar repair.Beside that, however, was a walled-off business called Border Systems, a name that at first glance could be a hard Brexiteer’s fantasy. On closer inspection, the services offered were for purely private security: house alarms, CCTV, automated gates, etc. The frictionless Border technologies Brexit supporters talk of are at least as far into the future here, where nobody wants them anyway, as elsewhere.Meanwhile, another wall I passed on the road into ’Blayney carried a faded reminder of Troubles past: “Touts beware”.And nearby was an example of the “ordinary crime” (as it used to be called, to differentiate from the political) on which post-Troubles security systems are focused.A poster of a John Deere tractor, under the word “Stolen”, was fixed to a telegraph pole, with a reward offered for information. The notice added that the tractor had been “last seen in south Armagh”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

He also criticised the fact there was no contest for the leadership of the party either in the North or the Republic.“That’s a real issue and it’s very noticeable in Leinster House – you get the sense that Sinn Féin TDs are controlled by their party, that the apparatus of their party is very much in control, as opposed to other parties which are very much answerable to the wider electorate.”He claimed there were “shadowy figures” in the background of Sinn Féin and that this had been stated by the PSNI, which alleged the IRA remained part of the modern republican movement. That charge was rejected by Sinn Féin, which said “the IRA is gone and not coming back”. Mr Martin said he took issue with Sinn Féin’s “propensity to impose the current situation on history” and its tendency to present a narrative of recent Irish history that sought to justify some of the horrendous atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA.“Sinn Féin want us all to accept a narrative of the past, they want us to become apologists for the most horrendous crimes and I’m not going to let that happen and I’m very determined to make sure that they are called out in certain aspects (when) they try and say it was all justified.”Mr Martin cited a recent documentary on Northern Irish politician John Hume in which commentator Eamonn McCann observed that people doing tours of the Bogside heard no mention of the role of Mr Hume, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, in events in Derry during the Civil Rights movement.“John Hume has been written out of the equation and that’s a very significant issue,” he said. “Sinn Féin wants to create a new narrative about what happened in the last 40 years and that has to be challenged. They should be less hung up about that and far more open on it than they have been to date.”Asked by Ms O’Leary what his response would be if Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald were to issue an unreserved apology “without any whataboutery” for IRA atrocities and draw a line between the present Sinn Féin and the past actions of the IRA, Mr Martin said he would warmly welcome it.“I think that would be very significant progress .... I think that would be a very significant development that I would consider and would encourage her to do,” said Mr Martin, adding that it would mark a clear ision between the Sinn Fein parliamentary party and the IRA."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Two other guests evacuated from the hotel have contracted a shigella infection. Following the sudden deaths of a British couple at a holiday resort in Egypt last week, two of the  guests evacuated from the hotel where the couple were staying have said they have been infected with the bacteria Shigella.They were among some 300 guests evacuated from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada following the sudden deaths of John and Susan Cooper from Burnley, Lancashire, who died within hours of each other.Samples tested in a British lab showed that the mother and her young daughter, from the north west, were suffering from infection with the bacteria, which can be transmitted through food or water. It is believed that they caught the infection while staying at the resort. Others are also thought to have been infected.Shigella - a group of bacteria similar to E. coli -  is a highly contagious and common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria causes the infectious disease known as shigellosis.There are four different types of shigella. Shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri are the kinds more commonly found in the UK.Shigella boydii and shigella dysenteriae are more common in developing countries - cases of infection with these types of the bacteria found in the UK tend to be among travellers coming back from holiday. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people who are infected with the bacteria develop diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps one to two days after they have been exposed. Mild cases of the infection usually clear up in five to seven days.Some people who are infected with shigella do not show any symptoms but they are still able to transmit the bacteria to other people.In more serious cases shigella can cause dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes bloody or mucus-containing diarrhoea.Shigella is highly contagious and it takes just a few of the germs to make someone sick. The germs are found in the faeces of infected people while they have diarrhea and for up to two weeks after the diarrhea has gone away.The germs are spread when someone touches their mouth with hands that have been in contact with the shigella bacteria or eats food with the germ on it. You can get shigella bacteria on your hands after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with germs from the stool of someone with the infection, eating food made by someone who has shigellosis, handling nappies of an infected child, swallowing infected water or having sexual contact with someone who is infected or is recovering from a recent infection.Shigella causes some 165 million cases of disease worldwide each year - mostly among children under five in less wealthy countries.Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and Asia have in the past been hit by pandemic waves of the disease.2,327 laboratory-confirmed cases of shigella infection were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014 compared to 1,991 cases the previous year. At least 20 per cent of cases were related to travel.Confirmed cases in the UK have risen in recent years - according to Public Health England (PHE) this is most likely due to a rise in infections among gay and bisexual men. Clusters of cases have in the past also been reported in schools and day care centres - however, there is currently no warning of a general outbreak in the UK. More than one million people are estimated to die from shigella infections each year.Most cases clear up without issues but serious complications could include severe dehydration, seizures (particularly in children),  kidney failure and paralysis of the colon preventing bowel movement or passing gas which could cause the colon to rupture open if left untreated.Young children are the most likely to get shigellosis, but anyone can be infected. According to PHE, cases among adults in the UK (not just those returning from holiday) have risen in recent years and the majority of reported cases in the UK are now seen in people over the age of 16.People who go on holiday to developing countries could contract types of shigellosis that are not easily treated by antibiotics.There have also been outbreaks of shigella among gay and bisexual men who can transmit the bacteria during sex.There is still no vaccine to prevent shigella infection so practicing good hygiene is one of the main ways to help prevent the germ from spreading.According to Mayo Clinic in the US, hygiene measures you can take to prevent the bug from transferring to others include frequent and careful handwashing with soap, not preparing food for other people if you have diarrhoea, keeping children with diarrhoea home from school,  cleaning nappy changing areas after use and disposing of dirty nappies in covered, lined bins and not swallowing water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. Severe or persistent cases of shigellosis are usually treated with antibiotics.You should pay a visit to your  GP if symptoms do not improve after a few days or are severe - for example if your or your child\u0027s diarrhea is bloody, if the diarrhoea is causing weight loss or dehydration or if it is accompanied by a fever higher than 38 C.

whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi - posted a photograph of himself in an airport corridor, sitting in a wheelchair and holding crutches, though it wasn\u0027t clear which city he was in.He was elected to parliament last year and has built a large following among young people excited by his scathing attacks on President Yoweri Museveni.Protests erupted in the Ugandan capital of Kampala on Friday when police detained the pop star at the airport as he tried to leave the country.Safely arrived in the US where I\u0027ll be receiving specialised treatment following the brutal torture at the hands of SFC soldiers, he wrote on Saturday, referring to Uganda\u0027s Special Forces Command.I will soon tell you what exactly happened to me since 13th August and what is next, he said, referring to the day he was detained after being accused by authorities of throwing stones at a presidential convoy. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.He has previously said he was beaten up and tortured while in detention.Ugandan authorities initially dismissed the allegations that Mr Kyagulanyi was beaten up in detention as rubbish and fake news. But late on Friday a police spokesman said there would be an investigation into those allegations.Supporters of Bobi Wine celebrate his release on bail earlier this weekMr Kyagulanyi, who has emerged as a formidable threat to the president who has been in power for 32 years, was charged with treason over his alleged role in the stoning of Mr Museveni\u0027s convoy.Mr Museveni has won praise in the West for his opposition to militant Islam in the region, but many Ugandans regard the 73-year-old as out of touch with his people, nearly 80 percent of whom are under the age of 30.He has been in power since 1986 and has repeatedly been accused by his opponents of rights abuses and the widespread use of security forces to suppress opposition to his rule. He denies charges that his government is involved in rights violations.The contrasting fortunes of Emmanuel Macron and Matteo Salvini as threat grows to French president\u0026#39s vision of EuropeComment: A proposed ban on energy drinks reflects the confused and controlling cravings of our nanny stateSmart bins to tackle aggressive seagulls and clean up parksOpticians to refer patients at risk of brain tumours directly to hospitalBritish Second World War veteran sets scuba ing record at age of 95Pentagon cancels aid to Pakistan amid growing tension over militant havensAretha Franklin funeral bishop apologises to Ariana Grande for \u0026#39over friendly\u0026#39 hugGovernment fund launched to help preserve at-risk places of worshipDrivers will beat traffic jams through new app which maps UK\u0026#39s most congested roads, minister vowsCathy Newman speaks about being bullied at school as she joins celebrities backing Princess Diana’s charityComment: I backed Chequers but can no longer support this humiliationComment: Staying in the EEA would fail to respect the referendum and be bad for BritainHelp to Buy scheme facing the axe amid concerns it is pushing up house pricesFury at plan to turn Grade II listed pub into children\u0026#39s nurseryStop telling children arts are pointless or risk Britain falling behind in tech revolution, director of National Theatre saysComment: Fair enough if couples don\u0026#39t want to get married, but why should they have the legal rights of those who do?Inside Britain\u0026#39s prisons where inmates are addicted to spice - and 999 calls are made every 40 minutes Queen officially unveils new Highland Games pavilion at annual Braemar GatheringCulture of immediate gratification fuelling puppy farms charity warns as third of dogs bought online becomes sick or dies in first yearStar-studded Hatton Garden film angers victims for \u0026#39glorifying\u0026#39 the £14m jewellery robbersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/02/TELEMMGLPICT000173028420_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"u2 apologise fans bono loses voice berlin gig","story":"U2 performing during their opening night in Berlin, which went off without a hitchU2 were forced to abandon their concert in Berlin on Saturday night after Bono lost his voice.The Irish rock band were a handful of songs into the second date on the European leg of their Experience + Innocence tour when the singer apologised to fans and said he was unable to continue.I think we can\u0027t go on,”  he said, according to accounts published on social media.  “It\u0027s not right for you.Afterwards, the three other members of the band – Larry Mullen Jnr, the Edge and Adam Clayton – issued a statement thanking fans for their support and understanding.“ We\u0027re so sorry for tonight\u0027s cancellation,”  they said.“Bono was in great form and great voice prior to the show and we were all looking forward to the second night in Berlin, but after a few songs, he suffered a complete loss of voice.“We don\u0027t know what has happened and we\u0027re taking medical advice.”One video posted on Saturday night seemed to show the singer coughing before apologising in a hoarse voice.Ashley Judd, the actress, was in the audience and tweeted that the crowd “felt for him” as he appeared “obviously  powerless and vulnerable”.Some fans suggested that smoke machines may have been to blame.Bono initially tried to put a brave face on his obvious discomfort.I\u0027m sure this is not a big, big problem - but I\u0027m going to have to do something. he said  in a video posted by a fan on Twitter . If people want to go home, that\u0027s fine - we\u0027ll play another show for you another time.At first the show was paused  after Bono said he would leave the stage for 10 minutes but the audience was soon told the performance would have to be cancelled.There is some consolation for disappointed fans.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/01/16/gettyimages-497195850.jpg","title":"daniel craig rachel weisz baby girl first child birth","story":"Created with Sketch.The couple are well known for keeping their relationship extremely privateClick to followThe IndependentThe pair began dating in 2010 and married in June 2011 in a private New York City ceremonyDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have reportedly welcomed a baby girl – their first child together.The James Bond actor, 50, and\u0026nbspOscar-winning\u0026nbspThe Constant Gardener\u0026nbspactor, 48,\u0026nbspare said to have told friends they are “very happy”.The couple\u0026nbsphad been friends for many years before working together in 2011 film Dream House.\u0026nbspThey began dating in 2010 and married in June 2011 in a private New York\u0026nbspceremony, with just four guests in attendance.Weisz first publicly acknowledged her pregnancy in April.

That may be due to the stress of the role, but is also linked to heavy drinking cultures around politics. Alex Salmond is to be credited with making significant strides towards modernising alcohol policy in Scotland with a view to reducing harm.\u0026nbspHowever, that does not excuse any inappropriate behaviour should reports be true. Just as Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos party has invited the people of Scotland to look again at their relationship with alcohol, maybe now is the time for politicians in Scotland, and across the UK, to do the same.                Alex Salmond ATTACKED: \u0026rsquoHe is doing this because of his EGO\u0027                Sturgeon\u0027s warning to Salmond camp as legal fight beginsWhen the claims first surfaced last month, Mr Salmond twice refused to answer questions about whether he had been drinking at the time of the alleged incidents.Asked if he used to drink too much as first minister, he replied: I try to pursue my life as best as I am able. I\u0026rsquom not a paragon of virtue by any means whatsoever and I\u0026rsquove never claimed to be.While in office, Mr Salmond led a crusade against Scotland\u0027s drinking culture with legislation such as a lower drink drive limit, minimum pricing and a ban on multibuy promotions.\u0026nbspIn 2014, he said: There is something deep about Scotland\u0026rsquos relationship with alcohol that is about self-image \u0026ndash lack of confidence, maybe, as a nation \u0026ndash and we do have to do something about it.Both political allies and opponents say Mr Salmond was not known as a heavy drinker at Holyrood or Westminster, although he is known to have enjoyed an occasional glass of wine or champagne.Despite rumours of all-night drinking sessions in Bute House with members of his inner circle, insiders say Mr Salmond was too much in control to drink to excess.Nicola Sturgeon has sent out a warning to Alex Salmond\u0027s supporters (Image: NC)One Scottish journalist said: I think he likes a drink, perhaps a glass of red wine like a Rioja, but he\u0027s nothing like an alcoholic. I\u0027ve had lunch and dinner with him and it was nothing out of the ordinary for his generation. Put it this way, I\u0027ve been out with politicians who drank a hell of a lot more than he did.And a Scottish MP said: He wouldn\u0027t have been the first who came to mind if you were to ask me to name the heavy drinkers in the SNP. You would occasionally see him in the Members\u0027 Smoking Room which is MPs only but he\u0027s not somebody you would always find in Strangers\u0027 Bar.He wasn\u0027t somebody who socialised with the other parties, he wasn\u0027t clubable and he always stayed within his group. Having said that, when he came back to Westminster in 2015 he was a somewhat different character, I think he was enjoying the freedom of his position a bit more.Before losing his seat last year, Mr Salmond was often seen socialising on the House of Commons terrace beside the Thames, which is traditionally a Tory haunt. He ordered pink champagne during lunchtime interviews and last year he was even spotted drinking champagne with his breakfast in the first class lounge at Heathrow.Most Nationalist colleagues drank in the rowdy Sports and Social Bar and former bar manager Alice Bailey last year said she was propositioned for sex by drunken MPs, most of them from the SNP or Labour, at least 30 times in four years.\u0026nbspLast night, a spokesman for Mr Salmond said he would not be making any further comment.Meanwhile, the former first minister\u0026nbsphas closed his controversial crowdfunding campaign after raising over \u0026pound100,000 to help fund his legal challenge against the Scottish GovernmentThe appeal for money to help with his court battle over how the sexual harassment allegations against him have been handled was launched as he dramatically quit the SNP.But after his heavily criticised funding campaign raised double its \u0026pound50,000 target, Mr Salmond announced he was closing it.He said: Many thanks to the thousands of people who have come forward with support. We will now press on with the challenge to the lawfulness of the procedure. All funds will be used exclusively to support the judicial review.He resigned from the party (Image: NC)If we are successful in the Court of Session then there are likely to be substantial surplus funds and, as I have pledged, every penny will then go to good causes in Scotland and beyond.However, a source close to Mr Salmond yesterday said the legal fees could run to a quarter of a million pounds.The friend said: If it goes to proof it could last three or four days which is \u0026pound250,000 easy and he\u0027s not got that sort of money. He\u0027s not a wealthy man, he\u0027s given a lot of money away to charity and RT is not a big payer contrary to what people are saying.Mr Salmond was informed in March of an investigation by the Scottish Government, after two complaints about his behaviour were made in January.The allegations date back to 2013, with Police Scotland having already confirmed details have been passed to the force.Mr Salmond said he wants to ensure the procedures are fair and lawful and insists that his right to confidentiality has been breached.10 facts about alcohol that you probably didn\u0027t know.                          Getty Images1 of 1110 unbelievable facts about alcoholOn Friday lawyers at the firm Levy \u0026amp McRae confirmed a petition for judicial review in the Court of Session had been served.The Scottish Government has pledged to vigorously defend its position in court, saying there are a number of inaccuracies in Mr Salmond\u0027s public statements.When the crowdfunder was closed it had raised \u0026pound100,007 from 4,146 supporters in three days - with people giving an average donation of just over \u0026pound24.A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: Alex Salmond should never have been squeezing cash out of SNP supporters in the first place.His legal action has nothing to do with independence, yet he used the cause to convince the party faithful to cough up.It was crass and certainly not becoming of a former first minister of Scotland.

We must have a detailed backstop solution which is legally operational in the withdrawal agreement.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a matter of some urgency. We have work on drafting an operational backstop. With no backstop, there will be no agreement.The EU also says Britain cannot cherry pick what it wants, saying single market access comes at the cost of free movement of people.Recent talks between Mr Raab and Mr Barnier saw the Frenchman declare to offer Britain a \u0026ldquodeal like no other. EU\u0027s plan to STOP annual changing of clocks Yet the October deadline imposed by EU member states draws ever closer.At Friday\u0026rsquos press conference, Mr Barnier added: We have I think all the necessary building bricks to build a close and effective relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom on a series of subjects which are very important for the citizens.Week after week and step by step we are eliminating subjects, bones of contention... I\u0027m determined, we\u0027re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite and Dominic and I think it\u0027s possible to reach that in October.Mr Raab said he was hopeful the UK and EU would reach an agreement by the time of the EU Council summit in October. He said: We are committed to the October Council \u0026ndash there is some flexibility but we are committed. I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is in our reach.

And if our businesses are still tied up in its red tape.The EU itself admits ditching just seven of its regulations will save our firms £5.4billion a year.There are colossal savings to be had. We must not squander the opportunity.Earlier, France’s Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau attacked the PM’s Chequers plan as too beneficial for Britain, saying it has the benefits of Norway’s full market access but only the light obligations of the EU’s trade deal with Canada.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “There has to be a balance between rights and obligations”.The remarks were seen as a money demand, as Norway makes annual contributions to the EU’s budget in exchange for single market access, along with every member state. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith.

Do you not think he would have wanted a hero’s death instead?’“My whole world was rocked to the core. I had never even considered not saving his life and I was haunted by the events of that day for years.“I was elated Mark was alive but I was deeply upset at the comments made about not allowing him to die.“From total dedication and conviction, I found myself not wanting to go out on another rescue.“I lost belief in what we were doing out there. It was horrible. I started to think about my own mortality. There were times when I just wanted to go home and be with my family.“Now, after speaking to Mark and asking the questions I’ve wanted to ask for so long, I know we made the right decision to fight for his life. I couldn’t be more sure of anything.”After Mark was flown back to Britain, Charlie, 43, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, followed his life from afar, monitoring news coverage and asking after him through medical channels.He had been told he would never walk again but she saw how he defied the medical experts — most notably by tackling a run across America on prosthetic blades in aid of military charities.And last year 35-year-old Mark, from Plymouth, Devon, won four medals at Prince Harry’s Invictus Games, the international sport event for injured veterans.He was dubbed “Superman” by the Prince, who became a friend and invited him to his wedding in May.Mark is writing his autobiography so he invited Charlie — now a squadron leader — to meet him to explain exactly what happened on the day he nearly died.The pair met at Headley Court, the forces’ medical rehabilitation centre in Surrey, where Charlie works.After hugging her, Mark told The Sun on Sunday: “We’d crossed paths fleetingly over the years at military events but we never had a chance to talk properly.“I wanted to ask her questions and thank her for saving my life. I had no idea just how important it was to her, how much everything had affected her.“I told her to never, ever doubt what she did that day. She has suffered greatly. Her sacrifice has meant I was given a second chance. Without her I would have died. I owe her everything.”Mark — dad to Kezia, 13, Mason, six, and Evie, three — added: “Two of my children wouldn’t even be here today without Charlie’s dedication and skill. She’s an inspirational woman and a true hero.“I have the most amazing life, and I cherish it every single day. And it’s all down to the woman who refused to give up on me as I lay dying in her care. I thank her from the bottom of my heart.”It was in the early hours of Christmas Eve 2007 that Mark was out on a routine foot patrol when he stepped on an improvised explosive device.Charlie’s medical response team was stunned by the scale of his injuries. He was unconscious, with his right leg and right arm hanging by a thread of skin. His left leg had been blown off in the blast.He had suffered catastrophic bleeding and was near to death.Charlie said: “It was vital to get fluids into Mark or else he’d die but the loss of his limbs meant there was nowhere to pump the fluids and the veins in his remaining left arm were flat and unresponsive.”On the helicopter flight back to HQ at Camp Bastion, the team decided to opt for a risky emergency procedure they had learned only days earlier but had never used.The intraosseous infusion – unlicensed for civilian patients because it is so dangerous – involved drilling a hole into Mark’s hip to deliver life-saving fluids.Charlie said: “We had one shot on each hip to make it work but the skin wasn’t taut enough on my side and it failed. I pulled the skin as tight as possible for my colleague to try the other side and this time it went straight in.“That was the life-or-death moment. We got fluids in and bandaged his wounds.”Within 24 hours Mark was back in the UK being treated by specialists at Selly Oak military hospital in Birmingham.Back in Afghanistan, Charlie, who was later awarded the Royal Red Cross 2nd Class for her bravery, kept tabs on his progress.She said: “I was overwhelmed to learn Mark had pulled through and was making amazing progress but it didn’t help the way I was feeling.”Charlie carried on for seven more tours of Afghanistan but at a great personal cost.She said: “I had to learn to emotionally detach from patients. I knew Mark by name but I refused to write down or learn the names of any soldiers after him. It was the only way I could cope.“I had changed, and everyone could see it. My mum was desperately worried and it led to the breakdown of my marriage. I went off the rails.“No matter how hard I tried, the smell of Mark’s blood and the dust never left me. I became angry and impatient, a mess emotionally.“The only way I could make sense of any of it was to keep touring Afghanistan, obsessively trying to exorcise my demons.”Meanwhile Mark married Becky, 33, with whom he has Mason and Evie. He became a motivational speaker and fundraiser for the Royal Marines Association.He said: “People tell me they would never have been brave enough to be a Royal Marine but to us it was no big deal. The medics are way beyond that — without them I would be maggot feed.“It sucks that I was blown up but the likes of Charlie have the horrors of my injuries stored in their memories for ever.“I live a fantastic life with a gorgeous wife and children, thanks to Charlie.“The only way I know how to repay her is to cherish every moment of my second chance.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We soon became aware of people being really ill with sickness and diarrhoea.“Some people didn’t leave their room. It cost £150 to see the hotel doctor, people were being taken to hospital because they were so bad.“There were health and safety issues in the dining room, the bedrooms, the entertainment areas, the pool — the list goes on.“The toilets were terrible with excrement up the wall.“The hotel was a year old but the rooms were already showing signs of wear and tear.“A number had technical problems associated with air conditioning. They were a health and safety risk, they were not cleaned thoroughly. Doors, cupboards, handles and mirrors weren’t cleaned.”John Cooper, 69, and wife Susan, 63, died within hours of each other last month after being struck down by a mystery illness at the hotel.Daughter Kelly Ormerod, 40, said there was “something suspicious” about the deaths and said her parents, from Burnley, Lancs, were in “perfect health” before falling ill.Brian went to the five-star hotel with his wife Gill and daughter Kayley, 17, in August 2014, and said they were initially impressed.But as he wandered around the complex, he became horrified at what he found and took photographs of the filthy conditions.He reported his findings to the Thomas Cook rep, who told him to speak to the hotel manager.Brian, who works for BAE Systems, said: “The more I looked around, it became clear why people were becoming sick.“Things weren’t being washed or cleaned. The swimming pool didn’t appear to be cleaned even when children had been sick in it.“Staff were not doing a thorough clean and were mopping hotel corridors with water that was black.“The snack outlets around the entertainment area were full of grime and muck.“Children would help themselves to burgers and kebabs, drop food on the floor and just kick it to the side where it would be left for days.“The aspect that worried me most was the dirt and grime that was left — it was a breeding ground for bacteria. We didn’t see staff clean the tables and chairs so bacteria could easily have been spread to the restaurant.“It was the unknowns that worried me the most — the aspects you couldn’t see.“In the entertainment area temperatures exceed 40C due to the absence of any air circulation caused by the enclosure. The food and drink dispensers were contaminated with waste food and drink.“Spilled food and drink wasn’t picked up and the chairs and tables weren’t clean.”Three days into the holiday, the family, from Wesham, Lancs, was struck down with a sickness bug.Brian’s wife Gill, 48, a primary school teacher, claimed she saw people at the restaurant buffet putting food into their mouths then spitting it back out into the trays.She said: “It was the first holiday we’ve wanted to come back from.“Kayley was crying because it was that bad.”Brian added: “If a lot of people have been reporting illnesses consistently over the last four years, hotel bosses have had ample opportunity to resolve the situation.”Last night a spokesman for Steigenberger said of the Coopers: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic death. All of our thoughts are with the family. We are highly engaged in running our own investigations concerning the tragedy.”Robert Greaves, 32, and his family also stayed at the hotel at the same time as Brian in 2014.He suffered a serious leg injury and is now bringing a personal injury case against Thomas Cook.Robert was in a pedalo when the water got choppy and a lifeguard arrived in a motorboat to help.He ended up in the water and the lifeguard directed him to the back of the boat. But the propellers were on and sucked him in, tearing into his leg and leaving a 4in gash.He claims he could have lost his leg but says the hotel has denied all responsibility, claiming their guest was hurt after falling off a ladder.Robert, from Blackpool, said: “I have had panic attacks and nightmares about being under water.“If the hotel and Thomas Cook had apologised that would have been something, but nothing.“I’m really angry about it.”Stephanie Osborne, from his solicitors Slater and Gordon, said: “Mr Greaves almost lost his leg and was exposed to a horrific situation through no fault of his own.”Thomas Cook said: “We have received Mr Greaves’ claim and are liaising with his solicitor.”A spokesperson for Steigenberger said: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic death and all of our thoughts are with the family.“In addition to our full support of the authorities, the tour operator and the franchise partner we are highly engaged in running our own investigations concerning the tragedy.“In respect for the family and the investigations of the authorities we cannot comment on statements or pictures at the moment. As soon as more information from the authorities and from our investigation become available, we will fully respond on all your requests.”A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said: “The safety and well-being of our customers is always our first priority. That’s why we removed 300 customers from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel after receiving further reports of illness last week.“We audit all 3,000 of our core hotels every year and so far this calendar year we have removed 47 hotels for health and safety reasons and a further 150 which did not meet our strict quality criteria.As well as the audits our quality teams regularly inspect our properties and provide support, guidance and training to help hotels improve.

A pair of girls running and screaming from a great white prowling just metres from the shore were shot down by a woman claiming this isn\u0027t sharknado. Video footage shows the moment two beach goers spotted a 3m long great white shark swimming in the shallows of a Massachusetts beach in the US. The huge predator skims beneath the waves before a dorsal fin breaks through the water, prompting frightened kids to scream and beg their mum for help. A woman standing behind the camera is unimpressed with the killer carnivore however, saying: It’s not coming on the sand, this isn’t Sharknado.  The footage was captured by Kay Marie at Outer Beach, an area which has seen an unusual rise in shark encounters over recent weeks.  The clip was uploaded on Monday to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\u0027s Facebook page, where it has already racked up more than 700,000 hits.  Viewers were quick to draw comparisons to Steven Spielberg\u0027s thriller – filmed in nearby Martha\u0027s Vineyard. It\u0027s terrifying to think this is the same waters Jaws the movie was filmed in, one posted.  Another added: Truly horrifying – and not the first we\u0027ve seen in Cape Cod recently. And a third joked: Sharknado? More like Jaws. The footage comes just a day after a great white was spotted charging at a diver along the same stretch of water. Earlier this month a 61-year-old man was savaged in another brutal shark encounter off Cape Cod, less than 25 miles from Outer Beach.

Terrifying footage captured the moment Palmer tried to burst into her house through a side door with the chainsaw in hand.   MirrorOnline reported yesterday how he had brandished a chainsaw at the mum in street after returning to the scene of a neighbour row \u0027like something out of a horror movie\u0027.

She told The Sun : I\u0027ve never felt so vulnerable in my life, I thought what\u0027s next?  The 28-year-old said Appleby had been banging on her door before the attack and screaming he was going to have her son taken into care. She confronted him before her partner Dean Brown and the thug started fighting in the front garden before a larger brawl broke out. Ms Appleby said: I just thought here we go again. I went outside and I was thinking in my head \u0027get off my property\u0027.

After downing more than 10 pints of lager, David Sadler killed wife Jill, 58, at their home in Wastdale Drive, Wirral, reports the Liverpool Echo .  The 62 year-old said his wife\u0027s \u0027nastiness\u0027 in a sweary Christmas rant to Joanne Reszczynski, their daughter who died of lung cancer in January this year, caused a permanent rift in the family and hastened the 34 year-old\u0027s death. He later told police: I just snapped, she caused the death of my daughter. I was just fed up with all the pressure. She just went for me. In an emotional nine-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court the dad-of-four admitted manslaughter but denied murder, saying he was mentally broken. Sadler argued loss of control, but mid-trial Judge Andrew Menary, QC, ruled there was insufficient evidence for this legal defence. Jurors had to consider whether he intended to kill or cause really serious harm when he strangled his wife and suffocated her with a pillow.  After more than three and a half hours of deliberation, on Friday, August 31 they returned a unanimous not guilty verdict, prompting Sadler to burst into tears. Members of his family gasped in relief, hugged and cried in the public gallery, while he held his head in his hands in the dock. Six of the seven female jurors wiped tears from their faces, as the judge thanked them for their work on not an easy case at all. Sadler, who continued to sob, nodded and thanked the jury, some of whom stopped to smile and wave as they left the courtroom. Judge Menary said he would be sentenced for manslaughter on Monday morning and remanded him in custody. During the trial, the jury heard the married couple of nearly 40 years had four children - David, Joanne, Nicola and Aimee. Prosecutors accepted Mrs Sadler had a drinking problem and could be sharp or difficult, leading to an estrangement with Joanne. Having been told her cancer was terminal, she went home from hospital to spend her last Christmas with her daughters, aged five and eight. The court heard Joanne made a will stating should anything happen to her husband Chris, a close friend would bring up their children. Sadler told the jury she only had weeks to live, but his wife ranted: Why farm the f***ing grandkids off to people outside the family? He said as a result his frail daughter banned Mrs Sadler from seeing her in hospital, from travelling in her funeral car or attending the wake.  The grandad-of-six said Mrs Sadler was violent to him and difficult after his dad Wilf, 87, also died of cancer in September. Sadler said because of her drinking, she had changed and could become very aggressive, very nasty, abusive and uncaring. He said he loved her, but she had previously slapped and punched him and thrown car keys and mobile phones at him. Sadler said she would tell him I hope you die a terrible death and was annoyed at the time he spent caring for his parents. Asked by John McDermott, QC, defending, if he thought her actions caused his daughter\u0027s death, he said the cause was cancer. But he added: The way she treated a weak, diminished person, she didn\u0027t deserve it. I thought it brought her death on earlier than what possibly could have took its own toll.  The couple went out drinking at 5.15pm on Saturday, February 17 and ended up at the Coach and Horses pub. Mrs Sadler hired a taxi and went home at 10.50pm, leaving behind her husband, who stayed out until around 1.30am. CCTV captured him staggering with drink as he walked home, falling and cutting his face along the way. At 5.15am, he messaged his daughter Aimee and said: Please help, it\u0027s your mum come now with Ben so sorry. After he tried to call his daughters and their partners, Aimee and her husband Ben Turner rang back. Stuart Denney, QC, prosecuting, said he told Mr Turner: Jill\u0027s dead. I did what everyone wanted me to do. Police found Mrs Sadler, still warm but not breathing and with bruising to her face, lying on a bed in an attic bedroom. Paramedics arrived and took over CPR, but they could not revive her and she was pronounced dead at 6.01am. Mr Denney said injuries to her hands suggested she desperately tried to fight him off and it was murder plain and simple. Sadler said he fell asleep on a sofa, then went upstairs, when his wife noted blood on his face and said what\u0027s with the f***ing warpaint? He said he moved forward to show her but she hit him in the head with a TV remote control, after which he could not recall his attack.

The youngster was desperate to play the son of Vinnie’s gangster character Big Chris in cult movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . So he decided to make an impact at his audition in front of the sportsman-turned-actor, and director Guy Ritchie. Knowing Vinnie had played for Wimbledon, Peter wore his Arsenal kit. He recalled: “I needed to do \u0026shysomething to stand out so I had the idea of wearing my Ian Wright No8 Arsenal shirt under my coat. “My mum begged me, ‘Don’t you dare. You will upset him.’ But I was fearless then and felt I had to support my team Arsenal in front of Vinnie. “I walked in the room and casually took my coat off and Vinnie’s eyes popped out of his head. “He shouted, ‘Who is this cocky little b*gger?’ Everyone laughed and it just meant that Vinnie liked me. “I read my lines including swear words without a blink. It went perfectly. That moment got me the part. Guy and Vinnie saw I was brave, cheeky and funny. “Afterwards Vinnie admitted that he and Guy loved me because ‘I was a cocky little sh**.’”  Peter, now 31, was speaking 20 years after the low-budget comedy crime flick became a surprise international hit. It made household names of director Ritchie, and stars Jason Statham and Nick Moran. But Jones was the life and soul on set, said Peter, who had a unique insight into the making of the hit as its youngest actor. In the film, Peter’s foul-mouthed character Little Chris follows his dad around London as he collects debts and causes carnage on behalf of his underworld boss. Peter said: “You would never have believed that this was Vinnie’s \u0026shydebut role. “He was always so calm and \u0026shyassured, before then becoming the menacing Big Chris as soon as the cameras started to roll. “Back then it was seen by some as a joke that he was cast. But Guy got it. And it’s no surprise that his career has blossomed in Hollywood.” His first scene on set was when Vinnie’s \u0026shycharacter Big Chris \u0026shysmashes the lid of a sunbed into a debtor’s face. Peter said: “I was \u0026shyabsolutely a nervous wreck and so worried about fluffing the lines. “But Vinnie was the most calming influence on the set. You’d think he would’ve been the nervy one, given that \u0026shypressure. But he was \u0026shyalways talking to me about football, just relaxing me.  “Vinnie stood up for me always, \u0026shypatting me on the back and saying, ‘You are doing well.’ Everyone knew he was a hard nut but he had a soft centre. “Vinnie was so authentic playing Chris it scared me at times. I actually thought he was going to punch that guy in the sunbed for real at first as he was so intense. “And in the scene where he is smashing the car door on the robber’s head, it was pretty terrifying. “It still gives me chills watching that power and aggression on screen.” As well as \u0026shybeing taken under Vinnie’s wing, Peter reveals how real-life gangster and bare-knuckle boxer Lenny McLean treated him like a son. Lenny, who played enforcer Barry The Baptist in the film, used to invite Peter and his mum into his motor home to watch Emmerdale between takes. Peter said: “At first I was thinking, ‘That geezer is \u0026shyenormous and very scary looking.’ In our scene I said, ‘P*** off you nonce.’ “Afterwards he pulled me aside and said in that low powerful voice, ‘You are the only person who has said that to me and lived to tell the tale.’ “I didn’t have a clue what it meant at the time but he just took me under his wing after that. “I had no idea of his history or \u0026shyreputation. He was the only actor \u0026shyallowed a TV in his Winnebago on set and he allowed only us to watch it on breaks. My mum Christine was an avid Emmerdale fan so it must have looked odd, the three of us squeezed on a sofa, which just fit him. “He would make us a cup of tea and hand out sweets and biscuits. He must have felt really at home with us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results saturdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Saturday\u0027s winning National Lottery numbers for £7.8million jackpotYour life could be set to change forever if you scoop the top prize in tonight\u0027s National LotteryShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByLaura Forsyth20:24, 1 SEP 2018NewsTickets are on sale until 7.30pm on the day of a draw\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There is a massive \u0026pound5million up for grabs in tonight\u0027s Lotto jackpot - which would be a welcome addition to any bank account.

Now time is not on my side but I can’t face the thought of going to my grave knowing I haven’t tried \u0026shyeverything.”  Denise, who claims a probe by Canadian police was bungled, has spent the past 29 years \u0026shygathering evidence.   Three years after he vanished, aged 20, she got an \u0026shyanonymous note saying he had been beaten to death on the campsite where he was staying. But his body was never found and no one has been arrested. Denise has now been given the names of two people who may know of the events after she quizzed the others at the campsite. She said: “I’ve had to face the fact he is never coming home to me. All I want to do is give him a proper funeral and bury him by his nana, who adored him. “She died in 2006 without\u0026shy \u0026shyfinding out what happened to him and it absolutely destroyed her. I fear the same will happen to me. “I’ve asked the police to follow up on information I have given them but \u0026shynothing seems to have been done. There are two people out there who were living on the campsite when Charles went missing. I’ve been told they might have vital information.  “I’m going to knock on their doors and beg them to tell me what they know. I’ve got nothing to lose now.” Charles, who was on a gap year, kept in touch with his family regularly while in Canada. But Denise panicked when she had not heard from him for weeks. She begged officers to investigate but says she was treated as an overbearing mum. She recalled: “From then on, every day has been hell.” Denise, from Kew, West London, sold her beloved beauty salon to fund the quest and ran up a \u0026pound4,000 phone bill hunting for clues.   After she received the anonymous note in 1992 she hired a volunteer diver to dredge a local lake, where the note said Charles had been dumped. When they found a body Denise was so distressed medics tried to section her. The body turned out to be a suicide victim. She said: “They tried to section me but I told them, ‘I have a broken heart, not a broken mind.’  “Perhaps he is in the lake but it’s 98miles wide and one of the deepest in the world.

Lissa Statham said she was left crying with trauma when her Jet2 flight to Rhodes in Greece grew hotter and hotter.  The 45-year-old, who already suffers crippling anxiety about flying, said the frightening and frustrating ordeal left her scared to ever set foot on an aircraft again. Mrs Statham was travelling with husband Andrew, 39, and daughter Freya, nine, from East Midlands Airport when it had to make a sudden, unscheduled landing in Munich on August 12.  She told Hull Live : I was crying and in pure anxiety. Never will I fly with Jet2 again and I may never fly again full stop.   I haven’t flown for ten years because of major claustrophobia and finally after all these years my husband found a Fearless Flight course. After the course I felt ready to book a holiday abroad. She said: We were in the air for one-and-a-half hours and during that time we realised that the plane was getting hotter and hotter to the point where couldn’t breathe comfortably. We were told the cabin reached 45 degrees by another passenger.   Ryanair \u0027flight from hell\u0027 as \u0027rowdy Brits including screaming teen leave passengers and crew terrified\u0027  The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful, but one came up to me and said that the plane was going to perform an emergency landing at Munich. Jet2 has since said the landing was only precautionary, but Mrs Statham insists the cabin crew told her it was an emergency. She said: I remember it clearly, it was definitely told it was an emergency landing. We could smell burning in the aircraft but the cabin crew told us that that was completely normal and was due to the engine turning off so suddenly as it backfired.  Eventually we landed in Munich. We sat in the Munich airport for three-and-a-half hours with no word from anyone. There was no Jet2 rep at the airport because they do not fly to Munich. The whole ordeal was frightening, frustrating and out of order because we were left to fend for ourselves. We were told we couldn’t even have our suitcases off the plane and there were children on the flight that were disabled and needed their medication. Mrs Statham explained that she was later moved to a different part of the airport and, at midnight, several hours later, she was told by airport staff she would be getting a room in a nearby Holiday Inn.

His future bride was spotted wearing a blue beaded bracelet, which was very similar to one the prince wears. Photos of their wrists went viral, and everyone got very excited comparing the two accessories. But in all the photos, next to the beads, is another bracelet - and it\u0027s one Harry has been wearing for more than 20 years. Even though nobody was really looking at it at the time, there\u0027s a very touching but heartbreaking story behind it and it\u0027s extremely important to Harry.  Prince Harry wears the silver bracelet a lot, especially at important events including big polo matches, the day he picked up his exam results and for his official school photos. And he also wore it on the most important day of his life so far - his wedding day.  Most recently, he was seen wearing it when he went to watch Hamilton with Meghan for his charity Sentebale .   It is believed he got the bracelet during a trip to Africa in 1997, shortly after the tragic death of his mum Princess Diana, reports Business Insider .  In a previous interview, Harry said: I first came [to Africa] in 1997, straight after my mum died.  My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all. Since then Harry has had a strong bond with the country, and visits regularly both personally and for official royal duties. He took Meghan to Botswana in southern Africa on one of their early dates, and it\u0027s believed he also visited the country with several of his ex-girlfriends.

Holiday makers who stayed at the four-star Playa Pesquero resort in Cuba have taken to social media to report a mass \u0027three-week food poisoning outbreak\u0027 at the luxury hotel.  Facebook was flooded with complaints by fuming customers, with one claiming there were flies flying over the food and that meat and fish were “left to rot” as no ice was used to preserve them. According to the MailOnline, Sunflower 064, from Coventry, posted: “We\u0027ve just returned home from 9th visit and our last. I suffered food poisoning within two days resulting in needing IV drips and antibiotics. Meanwhile Maja25x from Manchester said: “My husband got ill with food poisoning so did many other people and their children and heard about sixty people being sick from the Thomas Cook rep as we asked her straight. “Hubby got an injection, antibiotics and also an iv drip. It’s been a nightmare. Hotel tries to hide the outbreak by offering free medical treatments only after people sign a disclaimer that states you didn\u0027t get sick at the hotel and you can\u0027t comment about it.”  And a father-of-four who just returned from the resort said his family, including his children, got sick. “Food poisoning was rife, he said. They come after a series of complaints made by people staying at the same resort in recent years.  Back in 2012 and 2014 it was reportedly hit by two separate food poisoning outbreaks, forcing Thomas Cook to splash out \u0026pound150,000 on 20 customers claiming compensation, according to MailOnline.  And in May this year Leigh Hall, who paid \u0026pound3,750 to Thomas Cook to spend her wedding and honeymoon at the same Cuban resort, was forced to spend her first night as a newly-wed wife on a drip after falling ill with suspected salmonella. Most brides get carried over the threshold on their wedding night, but I got wheeled into hospital, the disgruntled bride told the Mail Online.  The recent outbreak comes just 14 days after British couple John and Susan Cooper died at a Thomas Cook hotel in Egypt. Their daughter Kelly Omerod said there was “something suspicious” about the deaths and that her parents were in “perfect health” before falling ill at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada. Ms Omerod had reported her daughter could “smell something that was a little bit funny in her grandparents\u0027 room. The strange odour in the hotel room where John, 69, and Susan, 63, died has recently been confirmed by the local governor.   According to The Sun , the Cuba resort offered to pay for holidaymakers medical bills if they raised no further complaint.  One of the lawyers contacted by the victims of the latest outbreak, Nick Harris, said: “This is totally unacceptable. There is a worrying pattern here with Thomas Cook and illness. “People go on holiday to relax not fall violently ill, Harris, who is Head of Travel at Simpson Millar solicitors, said, according to The Sun. “And then for the hotel to try to bribe them when their violently ill with a disclaimer is sickening behaviour. It is even worse as some of the cases involve children. “People have complained of poor food hygiene, dirty equipment and under-cooked food with birds in and their droppings in the restaurant and food. “It\u0027s a disgrace and Thomas Cook should be doing more to ensure their guests safety.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tv weather girl fractured rival","story":"NewsTV weather girl fractured rival newsreader’s SKULL in barroom brawl after being confronted over ‘flirting with husband’A police report said news anchor victim Erica Bivens had confronted meteorologist colleague Chelsea Ambriz on a night out in Huntington, West Virginia, in the USShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Burke20:14, 1 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/tv/tv-news/video/chelsea-ambriz-starting-her-job-13177860,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA TV weather girl fractured a newsreader\u0027s skull on a night out - after being confronted over alleged flirting with her newsroom colleague\u0027s husband, it is claimed.

The woman, whose name has been changed to Ana to protect her identity, thought she was in the middle of a whirlwind romance .  But things took a sinister turn for the eastern European after the pair met up in Prague.  She told the Manchester Evening News : I met a guy online, Nic, and we clicked straight away. We started to speak regularly and I really looked forward to our chats.  He made me laugh and we had so much in common. I was nervous but excited when, after a few weeks, he suggested we meet in person.  I flew to Prague to meet him and we had the most amazing few days. We both agreed it was fast but we had really fallen for each other and we knew we wanted to be together. We opened up and shared our hopes and dreams for the future and he suggested we could start a new life together in the UK. “I was aware of the type of work I’d be doing but I was prepared for it and knew it could provide us with a lifestyle I could never dream of at home. Wages where I’m from are so low and most people live in dire poverty. She went on: “As soon as we arrived in Manchester I knew something didn’t feel right. Nic took my documents from me and deleted all my contacts and social media apps from my phone.  It soon became clear that I was part of a much bigger group, I wouldn’t just be working for myself. Ana is one of a large number of women from central and eastern Europe trafficked from abroad and pimped out in the UK. The numbers are such that the charity MASH - Manchester Action on Street Health - is employing interpreters, who speak languages such as Romanian and Hungarian, so they can reach out to these women, who may speak little or no English. And Ana told the paper how the charity had helped her escape the clutches of her pimp. She explained: “One night, Nic asked me to look after my passport as he was scared he’d get caught with it and I knew I had a golden opportunity to get away. My heart was in my mouth when I saw the MASH van come around the corner. I was so relieved to see it.

Glaswegians are not easily led by tall tales of creatures from other worlds, although finding explanations for the unusual sights can be tricky. In the past eight years, UFO logging site MUFON has logged 20 mysterious cases in the Scottish city. In several cases, spotters were able to get pictures of the strange objects in the sky.  Here Glasgow Live looks at examples which have been spotted on camera.  1. The rapidly moving ball in the sky   This picture was uploaded in March this year but related to an incident which happened around on Christmas day 2009.  The spotter says they were with a friend in a town near Glasgow and walking towards a residential area when a round, glowing object overhead began moving rapidly towards them. They say it moved too fast to be a Chinese Lantern and was not a star or a comet. They posted to MUFON: It was like nothing we had seen. Much too big to be a star, definitely not a comet, too fast to be a Chinese lantern. As it became closer overhead it slowed down and descended before ascending very rapidly and vanishing into the clouds. We were both quite scared by it and shaking a little, even though we did not see it close up we both thought because of the direction and speed it was going it may land on top of us. We uploaded the photographs that were taken to our computer and they turned out pretty blurry, mainly because the zoom on the camera was not so good and possibly because of the speed of the object. \u0027It was not a windy evening, quite still and the object made no noise, and had no wings or anything like that. 2. Seasoned stargazer spots UFO through binoculars  A seasoned Glaswegian stargazer, who regularly surveys the heavens through his telescope and binoculars, spotted something very out of the ordinary back in August 2009. He was examining the skies with his binoculars, when he saw a perfect cube appear, move, accelerate backwards and then disappear. The spotter said: I saw a perfect cube appear right before my eyes! I was looking at Zubeneschamali, which is the beta star in Libra, when the cube just came out of nowhere Speechless, I quickly spotted it with the binoculars, through which I saw a brilliant perfect cube with an illuminated border. It changed colour from blue to aqua-green and stopped cold. People have told me it was a satellite but know satellites have a very smooth consistent speed and direction, satellites do not just appear in the sky at a single spot, then progressively drift, speed up, slow down and stop, they definitely do not change colour and noway can they change direction. If anything in the sky can reverse directing at sharp angles instantly its a fair to say its not man made, the force on the object would rip it apart. 3. Craft with row of lights hiding in the clouds  If you look towards the left side of this photograph, at the bottom of the clouds, you can see a row of lights which arguably could be a UFO. The spotter of this craft above the skyline did not notice the lights themselves in the first instance. It was only later when clearing out his camera that he came saw them and uploaded them to MUFON in 2012. The spotter said: On finding these shots I put the image into Photoshop as I wanted to get a clearer look at the image on the left hand side in the clouds. I can say there is no way it could be an known aircraft. First thing is the size, then the faint out line and the order of the lights are not what I am aware of as standard configurations. It had me more than a little shocked. 4.

display in Dundee.The books and sheet music were donated to the Wighton Centre at Central Library in 2013 after they were acquired at auction by the Friends of Wighton.Following a lengthy restoration process, which led to some books having to be conserved page by page, the volumes are now ready to be enjoyed by the public.A launch ceremony is being held at the Wighton Centre today at 11am, which will be attended by Sir Jimmy’s son Jimmy Jr and his wife Margaret.Jimmy Jr and his family also contributed additional material to the rare collection of classical Scottish scripts.Members of the Friends of Wighton’s instrumental classes will play a selection of tunes from the collection.Sheena Wellington, of the Friends of Wighton, said Sir Jimmy, pictured right, had been a discerning collector of books and manuscripts, some of which are hundreds of years old.Sheena – who like Sir Jimmy is an inductee of the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame – said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to have them on display and we have some real rarities.“There is a collection of 19th Century books bound into one volume that we believe could be a first edition.”Among some of the other treasures are an 18th Century collection of harpsichord songs and a book of ancient Orkney melodies from 1885.There is also is a volume of ballroom songs from 1870, of which no catalogue record exists in any library in the world – making it unique.Jimmy Jr said his dad – who died in 2000 at the age of 92 – would be “overwhelmed” to know his collection was being shared with the city.“I’m delighted about it all – my father would have been delighted too, that it is now something the public can enjoy,” he said.“We wish the Wighton Centre every success with the collection and hope a lot of folk come to see

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre.

Defibrillators have been the best introduction.“The use of mobile phones, which have sat navs and radios, means we can get to where we need to be quicker than before.”Praising the group, Depute Provost Donnelly praised the group, saying: “They do a wonderful job at events all over Aberdeen and further afield, as well as supporting first aid training sessions to all different members of the community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex chef serving up musical treat","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA chef turned world-touring busker has been serving up a musical treat in Aberdeen.Yuu Horii, better known as Zorro, has been turning heads around the city centre with his guitar playing and singing as he aims to earn cash to continue his globetrotting journey – which has already taken him to Australia, New Zealand and Asia.The 38-year-old chose Aberdeen as his latest pit stop after spending time in Belfast.Zorro, from Osaka, Japan, has a sign to tell Aberdonians he is travelling and has visited 57 countries already over the last four years.Previously a chef, the busker has been putting smiles on passing faces with a number of hits – including Bruno Mars’ Marry You and John Denver’s Country Roads.It is the musician’s second time in the Granite City and he said he wanted to return after being made to feel at home the first time around.With a big smile on his face, Zorro told the Evening Express he had received a very warm welcome in the city.“I arrived in Aberdeen earlier this week, it is my second time here and I’m planning to stay until tomorrow.

This is our annual survey.“But the most recent information showed we had vacancies running at about 1 to 1.5% in Scottish education.“So clearly where we have vacancies it is unacceptable but it is at a very, very low level compared to many of our international peers.“Obviously there’s a whole range of different measures being taken to expand the pool of teachers available.“We’ve expanded recruitment into initial teacher education, we’ve created nearly a dozen new routes to make it more practical and flexible for individuals to gain access and indeed one of those routes is very focused on the north-east of Scotland through the partnerships that exist in that respect.“I’m very focused on trying to identify how we can secure the additional teachers into the teaching profession and to

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

I was glad the age limit had been lowered since I could enjoy the race with my dad.\u0026#8217John Hardie, the event organiser said: ‘With the guidance of British Cycling we managed to stage our event. As usual, the support from the people and businesses of Tarbert has been exemplary.\u0026#8216We wanted cyclists of all levels to enjoy the glorious cycle route 78, better known as the Kilberry Loop. It is a 40 mile cycle, not long for a sportive, but it is within the capability of most cyclists.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia. The objective of this expedition is to make real change to communities. The team will be installing clean water, building a play park and working in a rainforest eco-village. At the end of the expedition, the team will get the chance to enjoy the heritage and culture of this amazing country.The young people are involved in the planning and organisation of both expeditions. In addition, these young people from the 19th Argyll have committed to raising £10,000 \u0026#8211 30 per cent of the gross cost of their adventures \u0026#8211 during 2018/19.  To date £2,000 has been raised or committed with members of the team also securing part time employment to boost funds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strut your funky stuff","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/08/18, 1:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFord Line Dancers will soon be back strutting their stuff every Thursday.They will be back from August 30 in the newly-refurbished Ford Village Hall and welcome anyone, male or female, who is interested in joining.Line dancer Sue Grocock said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s a great way to exercise, and the beauty of this type of dance is that no partner is required neither is any dancing experience necessary as we will be going back to basics.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

and the Caribbean island of Barbados.\nFirst screened on Tuesday , Scots in Paradise features the Barbados Celtic Festival \u0026ndash a large cultural get-together held in and around the capital Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion of cultures through music, food and history.\nAmong the many acts to perform on the Bridgetown stage have been the Average White Band, piping pupils from Strathallan School in Perthshire and the National Piping Centre, led by Fifer Ian Lowther.\nSheila Sapkota from Selkirk\u0026rsquos Riddell Fiddle made headlines in Barbados this year when she performed with Jenni Borthwick, Robbie Sapkota and locals from the surrounding area of Hastings.\nSheila, who is from Selkirk, also performed with Barbados pupils from the Suzuki Violin School and children from St Patrick\u0027s RC Primary, playing Scottish songs taught to them by the St Patrick\u0026rsquos head teacher, Glasgow born Sister Pauline Dempsey.\nAnd several of Sheila\u0027s performances were caught on camera for the STV programme Scots in Paradise.\nThis year\u0027s Barbados Celtic Festival closed with a ceilidh, presented by local dancers from the island\u0026rsquos Scottish Dance Society, led by Scottish ex pat Ken Thomson.\nThe Celtic festival celebrates the shared history between Scots and the people of Barbados.\nAround the 1700s, Scottish and Irish immigrants were shipped all over the Caribbean to be indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their freedom.\nAny musicians interested in taking part in next year\u0026rsquos Massed Band events in May 2019 can sign up at www.barbadoscelticfestival.\nScots in Paradise will be available to watch on stvplayer.tv following Tuesday\u0027s broadcast.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"smails-makes-an-impression-on-malawi-visitors","story":"INNERLEITHEN certainly made an impression on a visiting group of

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats Protection.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter school governance reform","story":"Deputy first minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch,Longniddry.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"highland dancers cowal show success","story":"Savouring their Cowal Highland Games success are from left: Korri McMillan, winner of the Corrigal Black Trophy for first place in the beginners section age 7 years and under Sophie Galbraith, winner of the Isla and Duncan Lauder Memorial Trophy for first place in the novice section 10 years and under Ellie Gorman, winner of the Christina Cairns Trophy for first place in the beginners section 8 years of age Ella McGeachy, winner of the Newberry Shield for runner-up in beginners section 9 to 12 years and Solana McMurchy, winner of the Rita Ford Challenge Trophy for runner-up in the Argyllshire Championship under 13 years.

Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese-sold-in-east-lothian-recalled-after-salmonella-found","story":"  L\u0026rsquoEARL Mounier of France is recalling some batches of its Cheese AOP Pelardon after finding traces of the bacteria in the product.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band.

Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

School welfare and support officer Rachel was over the moon when her partner Mick Seedall, 48, popped the question in summer 2016.

She then vowed to snuggle into her dream size 14 dress and immediately cut out fat from her diet, joined a Slimming World group and went swimming five times a week.  Rachel, of Blackburn, Lancs., said: \"I started swimming 50 to 70 lengths four or five times a week and my weight came down.  \u0026ldquoMy eating habits also changed and I swapped out bad foods for good foods.  \"I loved putting mayonnaise on everything so I cut that out and I\u0026rsquove stopped cooking a lot of things in oil.  \"I now remove as much fat as I can from foods and I now have fruit in my bag.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmonds-lawyers-serve-legal-papers-on-scottish-government","story":"  A statement from the firm Levy \u0026amp McRae confirmed a petition for judicial review in the Court of Session has now been served on legal representatives of the government.  Scotland\u0027s most senior civil servant, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, is the named as the first respondent in the case, with lawyers saying she had established the procedure which Mr Salmond is now challenging.  He now intends to \"leave the Court to determine\" the matter, the statement said.  Confirmation of the action came as the crowdfunding campaign set up by the former first minister to help towards his legal costs got closer to raising \u0026pound100,000.  But his decision to ask the public for financial support has been branded \"unprecedented\" and \"unbelievable\" by opposition politicians - with some urging people to donate cash to women\u0027s organisations instead of give money to the former SNP leader, who served at both Holyrood and Westminster during his lengthy political career.  A statement from solicitors Levy \u0026amp McRae said: \"We can confirm at 10am this morning, a petition for judicial review in the Court of Session by Mr Alex Salmond was served on the legal representatives of the Scottish Government.  \"We can also confirm that first respondent is the Permanent Secretary, Ms Leslie Evans, who established the procedure which is the subject of challenge. The second respondent is the Scottish Government.  \"Mr Salmond has no further comment to make but intends to leave the matter for the Court to determine.\"  Two complaints, fiercely denied by Mr Salmond, were raised in January against him and he was informed of an investigation in March.  The allegations about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was first minister, emerged last week with Police Scotland having already confirmed the complaints have been passed to the force.  Mr Salmond announced his crowdfunding campaign at the same time he revealed he was quitting the SNP.  He said he was doing so because he feared there would \"substantial internal division\" within the party if his successor Nicola Sturgeon was forced to suspend him.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We will vigorously defend our position. As we stated last week there are a number of inaccuracies in Mr Salmond\u0027s public statements which for legal reasons we cannot ad dress just now. We will address those matters in court.  \"But no-one should forget that there are two complaints that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \"As a responsible employer, the Scottish Government had to address those complaints appropriately.\""},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-perhaps-we-need-a-second-reformation-to-finish-the-job-of-the-first","story":"  Rarely has a Pope visiting a Catholic country felt the need to seek forgiveness in this way and never with such remorse. This wasn\u0026rsquot the Supreme Pontiff Of The Universal Church Patriarch Of The West Primate Of Italy Archbishop And politan Of The Roman Province and Sovereign Of the Vatican. This was Francis paraphrasing Graham Greene\u0026rsquos whisky priest in the Power and the Glory. \u0026ldquoGod, forgive me \u0026ndash this is a proud, lustful, greedy church. It has loved authority too much. These people are martyrs \u0026ndash protecting me with their own lives. They deserve a martyr to care for them \u0026ndash not a church like this, which loves all the wrong things.  Even this was not enough for some who had suffered grievously at the hands of predator priests and bishops or for others who had felt utterly betrayed by a hierarchy that preached the love and salvation of Christ but offered only exploitation and demanded obedience in return. Yet, how could any spoken apology ever heal a hurt endured over generations? Only a firm purpose of amendment backed up by radical action could achieve that, and it would only be a beginning.  What would Francis have said if he were ever to visit Scotland? Oh certainly the hierarchy would assure him that the scope of the problem was much smaller in Scotland and hadn\u0026rsquot they also instituted an independent inquiry into how the church had handled claims of historic sex abuse here?  They wouldn\u0026rsquot tell him that the McLellan Commission turned out to be a pointless whitewash that effectively allowed the Scottish bishops to say: \u0026ldquoIt won\u0026rsquot happen again. Potentially thousands of survivors of abuse at the hands of predatory priests in Scotland are still seeking financial redress for their suffering and the means to seek proper medical attention for the psychological scars and physical wounds of their torment. I\u0026rsquove been permitted to see the correspondence of one survivor with a bishop, still currently serving. It shows a man in authority absolutely uncoupled from reality and believing that a meeting between survivor and abuser and a  nice cup of tea will make everything alright.  Widespread anecdotal and documentary evidence provided by survivors\u0026rsquo groups and those sporadic cases where the law has broken through the silence and the concealment suggest that in Scotland it is more than just a handful of rogue priests who are guilty. The church here can never be cleansed until the full scope of generational abuse is uncovered and the perpetrators and their protectors named and jailed. One West of Scotland priest told me this year: \u0026ldquoThis whole mess, and it is a mess, has come about not only because of cover-ups, lies and deceit but also because of the two things that the authorities in the church have thrived on for centuries: power and control.  Right now in Edinburgh, the seat of authority in the Scottish Catholic church, a stealthy bid for power and control is being carried out by a fringe outfit called the Faith Movement. Only seven of its members are priests in Edinburgh yet in the space of a few years they have all been promoted to key posts. Often, senior lay people have been relieved of their duties in several outreaches and ordered to make way for priests lacking relevant expertise and experience. Correspondence between a concerned group of ordinary, non-aligned Catholics about the activities of the Faith Movement and Archbishop Leo Cushley was abruptly ended when he expressed anger that the contents of a meeting would be shared with members. His attitude was one of a medieval baron telling his subjects that he was the boss and that was an end of it. \u0026ldquoThis church is hierarchical, he told them.  The official website of Faith carries badly-written articles supporting the hardest lines on abortion and sexual morality. Nowhere is there the merest mention of Pope Francis, presumably on account of his recent teachings on the need for a more human and compassionate approach towards gay people and remarriage for divorcees, not to mention care for the environment and his absolute opposition to the death penalty. Bizarrely, there is a blog urging us not to keep condemning Harvey Weinstein because we must all \u0026ldquolove the sinner but hate the sin. There is a defence of the sinister practice of holding anti-abortion vigils outside Scottish hospitals. Alarmingly, there are details of youth summer camps, including one for six-nine-year-olds under the supervision of \u0026ldquoexperienced youth group leaders, though there are no details of qualifications and disclosure certificates. These camps are held at Ampleforth, the grand and exclusive English Catholic independent school. I signed up for their monthly newsletter and my payment was duly acknowledged. I\u0026rsquove yet to receive a reply to my polite request seeking more information about Faith.  The Faith Movement is on one side of a bitter civil war raging in Rome whose outcome carries profound consequences for its millions of ordinary adherents. Faith and other culture warriors who worship absolute doctrinal purity above all else are implacably opposed to all the attempts of Francis to restore some love and compassion and the actual teachings of Jesus into church doctrine. In many places this has been fashioned over the centuries by ageing men, drugged by power and possessions, for the sole purpose of terrorising the faithful into obedience on pain of hell and damnation.  This matters even in a secular world because where there is poverty, injustice and suffering there you will also find many good and ordinary Catholics and members of other Christian organisations attempting to save lives and stand against evil. The present wickedness at the heart of the Catholic Church threatens schism and an end to that. Perhaps a second Reformation to finish the job of the first one is now required."},{"url":null,"title":"childrens-panel-members-are-no-angels-as-it-should-be","story":"  The proliferation of views is due to the fact the difficulty is not in forming opinions about what is best for children, it\u0026rsquos in justifying them. Adults allow all sorts of outside influences to shade their maxims about how things should be done, but very rarely stop to unpick why they believe that which they believe.  Justifying your views about a child\u0026rsquos life is one of the trickiest parts of being a children\u0026rsquos panel member. One might believe they know what is best for a child or young person \u0026ndash but faced with a room full of dissent, it can be hard to reach a conclusion and explain why.  A core difficulty is the competing dictums of a child\u0026rsquos rights and a child\u0026rsquos welfare. It is this tension that sits at the heart of Ian McEwan\u0026rsquos novel, The Children Act, which has been turned into a film starring Emma Thompson and is currently in cinemas. It refers to the 1989 law passed by Westminster, which attempts to ensure children are safeguarded by the adults and agencies in their lives. It admirably states that a \u0026ldquochild\u0026rsquos welfare should be the court\u0026rsquos paramount consideration. But the definition of \u0026ldquowelfare is left up to the individuals deciding what is right for that child.  In Scotland, of course, we support children and young people through the children\u0026rsquos hearings system, where a tribunal of lay people make legally binding decisions about safety and welfare.  It is often the case that children and young people, who are encouraged to speak for themselves at hearings if they can, want what is not necessarily best for them. An example of this is contact with parents who may have abused or neglected them. Other times, parents will assert their right to see their child, even when that is not beneficial to the child\u0026rsquos welfare.  In recent years the children\u0026rsquos hearing system has become more frequently populated with solicitors as legal aid became easier to access. The solicitor is the only person in the room whose priority is not the child, but their client, when the child and the parent\u0026rsquos interests clash.  Social work and the family may be at complete loggerheads. The truth is a slippery thing and never straightforward but a panel must weigh up testimony, all the while remembering there is no dilemma as long as one keeps the child at the forefront of decision making.  It is necessary to ensure everyone involved is viscerally dedicated to ensuring child welfare. This means recruiting the right people and is where the recent children\u0026rsquos hearing recruitment campaign went so badly wrong. Panel members were portrayed in the adverts with halos.  Some panel members may see themselves as white knights but these are not the right people to be involved with the system. A panel member should not be there for the sake of an ego boost or the smug satisfaction a halo would imply.  If one group wears a halo, it implies others are lesser and that is completely against the spirit of the thing. It\u0026rsquos also a nonsense: none of us are angels, all of us have flaws. None of us are immune from mistakes.  The children\u0026rsquos panel system faces scrutiny. Perhaps one day it will be professionalised and the thought of volunteers making these life-altering decisions will be an anachronism.  For now, it is not angels watching over our young people. It must be humans who are sharp-thinking, thoughtful and, as in The Children\u0026rsquos Act, alert to centring the child at all times."},{"url":null,"title":"speculation-mounts-over-vince-cables-plans-for-lib-dem-leadership","story":"  The former business secretary is to use a major speech next week to set out his long-term ambitions for the party amid reports he plans to quit as leader before the next scheduled 2022 general election.

Devolution had been endorsed through a referendum and voters were three months away from voting in the first Holyrood election.  The first issue, assembled by visionary editor Andrew Jaspan and his team, carried a front-page interview with Blair by Kirsty Milne, who was the paper\u0026rsquos first political editor. The then prime minister told the fledgling paper that devolution was a \u0026ldquo21st-century symbol of a \u0026ldquomulti-layered democracy based on \u0026ldquopartnership in the UK and the European Union.  Fast-forward to today, which marks the last issue of the Sunday Herald, and few people could have predicted how the political landscape that had existed under Blair would change.  Back then, the SNP had around half a dozen parliamentarians. Now the party has more than 100 MSPs, MPs and MEPs. Labour dominated UK and Scottish politics in 1999 but has been out of power at Westminster and Holyrood for a generation. Debate still centres around the constitution, but on independence, not devolution. And Brexit looks set to extinguish our relationship with the EU.  The Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos political journey over that period reflects the switch made by large segments of Scottish voters: broadly sympathetic to Blair in the early years of his premiership, but turned off by the Iraq war. Tentatively pro-SNP in 2007 \u0026ndash more out of frustration with Labour than anything else \u0026ndash before becoming pro-independence.  However, regardless of constitutional politics, the paper\u0026rsquos political anchor never moved. Under all three editors \u0026ndash Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald was centre-left, socially liberal and pro-European. Appealing to younger readers was also a key part of its ethos.  My overriding memory of the Sunday Herald is not just of a paper that adopted a distinctive position on independence, but of a publication that broke big political stories and had far-reaching consequences. In circulation terms we were bantamweight, but in our coverage we fought at a higher level.  Milne, who passed away in 2013, was in the job for barely a few months before moving on and going on to become a renowned columnist. Its first Scottish political editor, Douglas Fraser, brought intellectual heft to the Sunday Herald and was in post for five years from 1999. While anti-devolution publications tried to undermine the Scottish Parliament, his coverage was marked by fairness and balance. He was an authoritative presence who was the right political editor for the time.  Fraser was in post during one of the most shameful episodes of recent Scottish history. In 2000, when Labour\u0026rsquos former minister Wendy Alexander announced plans to repeal anti-gay legislation which banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools, forces including SNP donor Brian Souter, the Catholic Church and the Daily Record mounted an ugly campaign of opposition.  Douglas Fraser and his colleagues, to their credit, extensively reported the distortions of the Keep the Clause campaign, while the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos stance urged the Labour-led Executive to hold firm. The paper\u0026rsquos uncompromising stance in defending a vulnerable minority group helped define its political outlook more than any other issue. Opposition to the Iraq War, meanwhile, bolstered its progressive credentials.  Fraser also covered the early traumas and controversies of devolution, such as the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of his successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish, before moving to The Herald. We also benefited from first-class Westminster coverage from Iain Watson, James Cusick and Torcuil Crichton.  I became the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos Scottish political editor in 2004 after an approach by a senior figure on the paper. Although there had been a formal process, I got the impression the job was mine unless I cried or puked at the interview. I held my nerve and was hired by Jaspan.  Without making myself sound like a sociopath, I had a different temperament to Fraser and brought my own style. He was cerebral \u0026ndash I use that as praise \u0026ndash and interested in policy, whereas I was an angry 27-year-old who wasn\u0026rsquot quite sure what he was angry about. My title should have been \u0026ldquoanti-political editor. Months after I started, Jaspan moved to Australia and Richard Walker became editor. He wanted a more robust approach to politics, which I was comfortable with, and we worked together closely for 11 years until he left the paper in 2015.  I\u0026rsquom proud of our working relationship. An investigation into Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie\u0026rsquos expenses \u0026ndash yes, I think it was legitimate no, I don\u0026rsquot believe it was petty \u0026ndash led to him quitting and Holyrood publishing the entirety of the MSP allowances system online.  Stories on Labour chief Wendy Alexander\u0026rsquos dodgy donation to her leadership campaign triggered her resignation, while coverage of crooked MP Jim Devine\u0026rsquos expenses got him jail time. During the latter investigation, I was lucky not to die after getting knocked down by a random driver on the way to doing a television interview on the Devine story. I was later told a senior Holyrood figure had said he wished the accident had been \u0026ldquomore serious.  In 2012, by which time I was writing about politics as investigations editor, our stories on abuser Bill Walker, who was an SNP MSP at the time, led to him getting a custodial sentence. We also broke, and covered endlessly, the story on Labour shenanigans in Falkirk, which had major consequences outwith one town in central Scotland.  Reporters are only as good as their editors allow them to be. If your boss spikes your work, or puts it on page 38, the article has either zero or marginal impact. All these political stories were published during Walker\u0027s editorship. We had cross words once \u0026ndash it was my fault \u0026ndash and I can recall only one occasion in 11 years when I felt a good story had been canned. Any journalist would accept that sort of ratio.  Before this sounds like a self-regarding roll-call of glory, I should offer full disclosure by admitting to a mistake or two. In 2007, I reported that a mystery Labour MP \u0026ndash \u0026ldquohe or she \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquopoised to defect to the SNP. The story, much to my embarrassment, subsequently proved to be cobblers.  So appalled was I by the prospect of winning the Tartan Bollocks \u0026ndash given to the journalist who penned the most inaccurate story of the year \u0026ndash I fled to Paris for two nights and skipped the dunce ceremony. One colleague woundingly described my loser\u0026rsquos expedition as a trip to the \u0026ldquocity of self-love.  I also over-wrote a story about something vaguely controversial former first minister Jack McConnell had said about drugs when he was a student. My awful piece, which we splashed, had all the zest of a casserole that had been  decomposing in a garden for six months. Walker\u0027s last-minute \u0026ldquotweaks did not help. In the end, it read like it had been written in Bulgarian and put through Google Translate.  My successor, Tom Gordon, became Scottish political editor in 2008 and stayed in the job until 2016. To paraphrase author PG Wodehouse, it was never hard to tell the difference between Tom in a grumpy mood and a ray of sunshine. If there had been an Olympics for small talk, it is unlikely he would ever have made the podium. He was also the best reporter I worked with.  He and I \u0026ndash friends as well as colleagues \u0026ndash competed with rival papers, of course, but also with each other. We would have endless \u0026ldquodiscussions about joint bylines, under whose beat a particular story fell, and who had the best angle to justify top billing. It was my favourite time on the paper.  Gordon was the paper\u0026rsquos longest-serving Scottish political editor and had a terrific scoop count. He revealed how Alex Salmond had congratulated former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin on the botched ABN AMRO deal. He also reported how the Tory Government was planning to axe free school milk for under fives, a story that triggered a televised U-turn by the Government hours after its publication.  He also disclosed how Better Together secretly called their campaign Project Fear \u0026ndash a phrase that went viral \u0026ndash and exposed how the SNP had been auctioning Holyrood lunches at party fundraising events. One caveat: just as I cringe at my McConnell drugs \u0026ldquoscoop, I imagine Gordon does not dwell too long on his 2013 \u0026ldquoexclusive report about a predicted \u0026ldquooil boom in the North Sea. I did not seek a joint byline on that one.  Gordon\u0027s time in the job also coincided with the editor of the paper backing a Yes vote in the referendum. I offer no comment on this decision \u0026ndash it was above my pay grade \u0026ndash but some basic facts should be noted.  Unlike other newspapers, whose big editorial decisions are influenced by proprietors living abroad, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos position was not taken by its owner but its editor. It was Walker\u0027s call and he made the decision. He explained it clearly and never shied away from defending what even opponents of independence would concede was a major moment in the campaign.  It has also been said Walker was motivated by commercial opportunism. Again, wrong. His decision stemmed from his personal belief in independence. He had been moving the paper in this direction for around three years and was convinced it was the right move for Scotland.  Walker left in 2015 and was replaced by Neil Mackay, who continued with the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos pro-independence stance and who was instinctively supportive of investigative journalism. Our last Scottish political editor was Andrew Whitaker, an impressive story-getter who was known for his persistence in pursuit of an exclusive. Whitaker\u0027s reporting led to the SNP Government announcing an inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike and he revealed Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos plan for a reshuffle.  Having worked for 14 years on the Sunday Herald, it is natural I feel a huge sadness at the paper\u0026rsquos demise. However, a combination of branding difficulties and low circulation made the company\u0026rsquos decision to cease publication inevitable.  The creation of two new Sunday newspapers is also a positive move for the media in Scotland.  The Sunday Herald no longer has a future, but this should not detract from the impactful political coverage that its editors and reporters produced in the years since its iconic first edition nearly two decades ago."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-who-ran-companies-while-being-a-disqualified-director-convicted-after-sunday-herald-investigation","story":"  A BUSINESSMAN married to one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior prosecutors is facing prison after being convicted of running companies while a disqualified director.  Stephen Roberts, 50, was in effective control of two health and medical technology firms \u0026ndash one of which his law officer wife was a major shareholder in \u0026ndash while he was banned.  Roberts\u0026rsquo wife Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for homicide and major crime, is listed at Companies House as having had the largest holding of 8,997 shares in one of the firms, Log Six Systems , in 2013. Her husband owned 7,503, giving the couple a majority of the shares.  There is no absolutely suggestion Patrick knew about the management of the business at the time. The Crown Office is now investigating her husband\u0026rsquos financial affairs and have applied for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  Former bankrupt Roberts, of Troon, Ayrshire, was disqualified for four years in July 2010 after failing to ensure a previous firm, Innova Business Solutions, had paid tax. Innova owed \u0026pound292,882 when it was liquidated. An appeal judge described him as \u0026ldquoevasive\" and \u0026ldquodevious in cross-examination.  In 2013, a Sunday Herald investigation revealed Roberts was involved in a healthcare start-up, LSS, that won a \u0026pound50,000 prize at a Dragons\u0027 Den-style event funded by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government.  John Swinney, then finance secretary, presented the prize to Roberts and a former director but Scottish Enterprise later withheld some of the money. Despite Roberts\u0026rsquo directorship ban, which stopped him forming, promoting or managing a company, this newspaper uncovered footage of him saying on a crowdfunding site: \u0026ldquoWe kill superbugs, but we can do it 12 times faster and 100 times cheaper than existing disinfectant methods.  Log Six has the ability to save lives, time and money on a global scale with proven technology to a global problem. And with your help we can make it happen faster.  In another video, Roberts addressed an audience at Heriot-Watt University and said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a high-efficacy disinfectant chemical, which has been proven to kill every pathogen known to man.  The articles were followed by a police investigation and Roberts later denied two charges of being involved in the \u0026ldquoformation, promotion and management of LSS and another company, Nightingale Intensive Systems International, between September 2011 and July 2014.  After a lengthy trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Roberts was found guilty of both charges after Sheriff Iona McDonald ruled he had been a \u0026ldquodriving force of Nightingale and co-founder of LSS, where he referred to his \u0026ldquoinvestors.  McDonald told Roberts: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear you told almost everyone you were a disqualified director.  Gary Allan QC, defence counsel, told the court: \u0026ldquoThe whole sorry saga has been a social, family and financial catastrophe.  McDonald continued the case for 10 weeks for prosecutors to produce a statement of Roberts\u0026rsquo financial affairs for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-to-unveil-legislative-plans-to-msps-on-tuesday","story":"  Sturgeon, whose Government has been rocked by the sexual harassment allegations made against Alex Salmond, will attempt to get on the front foot by making announcements on the economy, mental health, and social security.

The first inklings of Project White took shape in February 1998 thanks to Gus Macdonald. Macdonald had risen from humble beginnings as an apprentice in the Govan shipyards to become one of the most significant figures in Scottish journalism. A glittering career saw him rise to director of programmes for STV by the mid-1980s and, after Tony Blair took power in 1997, he was made a life peer, taking his seat in the Lords as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston. He went on to become Minister of Transport and Cabinet Office Minister.  Macdonald, today in his mid-70s, was a powerful and influential man in the late 90s. At the end of 1997, he was appointed non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group, then owners of both STV and The Herald. As a leftwing big beast in the media, Macdonald was a man uncomfortable with the state of the Scottish press \u0026ndash for both political and business reasons. He felt the right-wing tilt of the Scotsman skewed the national debate, and also worried that The Scotsman \u0026ndash combined with its sister paper Scotland on Sunday \u0026ndash was a threat to both The Herald\u0026rsquos circulation and advertising revenues. So he hit on an idea \u0026ndash what if The Herald had a Sunday title as well \u0026hellip  One of the other big beasts of British and Scottish journalism in the 90s was Andrew Jaspan \u0026ndash a gifted maverick and an inspirational leader who had edited The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday. In early February 1998, Jaspan received a phone call from Macdonald out of the blue. Macdonald asked if they could meet in the House of Lords.  \u0026ldquoBack in the 1970s, Jaspan says, \u0026ldquoGus would have wanted a blether over a pint of beer, in the 1980s it might have been a glass of wine, now he tempted me with \u0026lsquotea served in the finest House of Lords\u0026rsquo bone china\u0026rsquo.  Macdonald had a simple proposition: would Jaspan be interested in setting up a new Sunday paper? Jaspan quickly agreed and soon he and the CEO of Scottish Media Group, a reserved but affable and media-savvy former accountant called Andrew Flanagan, met in London. Flanagan asked Jaspan to come up with a feasibility study \u0026ndash how much would this paper cost, how many staff would he need, how much money could it pull in, and most importantly: what would the paper stand for. Jaspan was told to keep the entire scheme utterly under wraps. Not a word was to be breathed to anyone.  Gary Hughes, Flanagan\u0026rsquos deputy, told Jaspan it was to be called \"Project White\". Jaspan asked why \u0026ndash Hughes replied \"because we have given you a blank sheet of paper\".  What followed next was a five-month period of intense and secretive work by Jaspan in order to get the figures right, mould the editorial philosophy, and come up with the branding and marketing for a new paper for Scotland \u0026ndash one of the most crowded newspaper markets in the world. By the end of August, Jaspan delivered Flanagan his masterplan.  He wanted to create a paper that felt young and aspirational.  The world had changed drastically by the time 1998 came to a close \u0026ndash the age of deference was dead, the Cold War was over, the Good Friday Agreement had been signed bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and Scotland was soon to get her own parliament again. Facile as it may sound today, back then \"Cool Britannia\" \u0026ndash a cocktail of Britpop, the craze for young British artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, fashion designers like Alexander McQueen, a new youthful Labour government, and a growing economy \u0026ndash seemed to sum up a country brimming with hope and change.  \u0026ldquoHistory was in the making and I wanted a paper that would embrace this change, Jaspan says. When it came to the new era of devolution, he wanted the paper to \u0026ldquowelcome the opening of a new chapter for Scotland. That\u0026rsquos not to say the paper would be a cheerleader, but we would give the new constitutional arrangements a chance to succeed, and pounce on any ill-thought out policy or actions. It was, then, to be a paper both positive about Scotland \u0026ndash there would be no \"Scottish cringe\" \u0026ndash and a watchdog over those in power. But what would it be called? From the get-go, the title that became the frontrunner was the \"Sunday Herald\".  \u0026ldquoThis instantly told readers that the paper was part of The Herald family, but of course a new Sunday paper, Jaspan says. \u0026ldquoWe had messed around with other neutral names, but no others were seriously considered. The upside was that this would be an easier sell to Herald readers \u0026ndash that is, to ask them to drop Scotland on Sunday and chose a west coast Sunday, the downside was that Edinburgh readers might still shy away from a Glasgow paper.  But the Sunday Herald was never intended to be just a Glasgow paper. Capturing sales and ad revenue on the west coast of Scotland was merely the first step to securing the financial future of a new national title, a newspaper which saw itself on the world stage, not on simply the British or Scottish stage.  With the title and vision in place, Jaspan needed to give the paper \"a look\". How to design a paper that wanted to be different to every other paper on the news stands? This was a paper that wasn\u0026rsquot going to talk down to readers, or tell them how to think \u0026ndash it would take for granted that readers were intelligent and well-read, that they wanted information and entertainment, not dull instruction from above. The look of the paper had to reflect that very modern approach to news.  So, one of the most talented designers in European newspapers made a trek north to Glasgow. Simon Esterson had won plaudits internationally for his work on the redesign of \u0026rsquos G2 section. To Jaspan, when it came to designing the new paper, Esterson was the only person for the job. Perhaps the best way to explain how radical Esterson\u0026rsquos design was is to ask you to turn to the front cover of this paper and look at the masthead \u0026ndash the title is all in lower case, the colours vivid primary blue and red. It 1998, this was a radical approach to newspaper design, and a dramatic way to signal a break with the papers of old. The Sunday Herald was to be simple, elegant \u0026ndash a canvas for what would go on to be award-winning photography and journalism. As the first new paper of the 21st century, Jaspan wanted to \u0026ldquoproduce journalism to read, not flick through.  The paper was to have six elements: five printed sections \u0026ndash News, Seven Days , Sport, Business, Jobs and a magazine \u0026ndash and, crucially, one digital section, a website, marking the Sunday Herald as the only paper to embrace online at this stage. Back then, The Herald and The Scotsman still had no web presence. After the Sunday Herald launched \u0026ndash using its website as an integrated part of the paper \u0026ndash , now one of the world\u0026rsquos most popular news sites, soon followed suit.  By now, everything was in place \u0026ndash apart from people: the staff who would make this still imaginary venture take life. And it was the people that made the Sunday Herald. Anyone \u0026ndash and I mean literally anyone, apart from a few sad souls who just didn\u0026rsquot get the spirit of the paper \u0026ndash anyone who has worked on the title will say without hesitation that not only did it give them the best years of their careers, but it often made their careers, and it made them friends \u0026ndash and sometimes lovers \u0026ndash who last with them until this day.  The first two people to be brought onboard were Charles Magee \u0026ndash a consummate journalist who has mastered every art in the industry \u0026ndash and Richard Walker, one of the most talented, hardworking journalists in the UK. Both had worked with Jaspan at Scotland on Sunday. Magee was to work on a publishing system \u0026ndash a bit like building a bespoke desktop printing press from scratch \u0026ndash and Walker tirelessly fine-tuned design. The three-man team holed up in a backroom in STV that stored the props for the crime show Taggart, working in secret to keep opposition newspapers in the dark.  With the foundations now in place, Jaspan went to the board of directors of SMG in September 1998 and got final approval to launch the paper \u0026ndash the only member of the board who seemed less than enthused was David Montgomery, the notoriously dour Ulsterman who had set up the now defunct Today newspaper, and was then running Mirror Group, which had a stake in SMG. Despite the board\u0026rsquos support, there was a sting in the tale for Jaspan: the board wanted the paper launched by the end of January 1999. He had three months to get one of the most ambitious media projects of the last half-century off the ground, and an entire team \u0026ndash more than 50 staff \u0026ndash to hire.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to recruit a cadre of journalists,Jaspan says, \u0026ldquowho would relish the challenge of working on a new paper, which would be a beacon of editorial excellence in everything it did. I wanted to hire journalists who had fire in their bellies \u0026ndash those who wanted to prove themselves rather than those hacks who just wanted to play the safe game and sleep-walk to their pension. I wanted free thinkers who would give the paper a feel of being new and different, so that we would not just be another ordinary Sunday newspaper.  In the end, that thought \u0026ndash \"No Ordinary Sunday\" \u0026ndash would become the tag line for all Sunday Herald marketing and branding. But it also helped Jaspan focus his mind on the kind of people he wanted working for the new Sunday Herald.  He quickly assembled a team, pillaging the best talent from opposition titles in Scotland and London \u0026ndash what better way to get the jump on Scotland on Sunday than taking its gunslingers and have them turn their firepower on their old employer. When staff were hired they were a little taken aback to find themselves each given a beanie hat \u0026hellip emblazoned with the logo \"No Ordinary Headline\"."},{"url":null,"title":"maverick-genius-some-just-plain-mad-people-behind-the-sunday-herald","story":"  There are too many names to list here but among those that stand out from the early days were Pennie Taylor, who joined as health editor from the BBC and remains to this day one of the go-to experts on the NHS Connie Henderson, an unflappable news editor also brought in from the BBC Torcuil Crichton, now the Westminster editor of the Daily Record and undoubtedly the most charming Gael to ever have left the western isles Susan Flockhart, the former editor of the Big Issue in Scotland and an old-fashioned intellectual who brought real gravitas and intelligence to the newsroom David Milne, a bright whip-smart young executive also from the Big Issue in Scotland who now looks after STV\u0026rsquos digital side Lesley Riddoch, the voice of Scottish feminism and a big brain and big player in the nation\u0026rsquos media Ron McKay, a hack\u0026rsquos hack, game for anything, and one of the best reporters to ever come out of Scotland David Pratt, perhaps the most seasoned war reporter this country has ever produced and a man who has risked his life countless times to bring back to Scotland the truth about what is happening overseas David Dick, known to the crew as Dave Vegas  and another big talent who is now the editor of the Daily Record Roxanne Sorooshian, one of the best production journalists in the game Jane Wright, a brilliant magazine executive and a woman born to throw a good party Alan Taylor, a literary flaneur and Scotland\u0026rsquos answer to Tom Wolfe Ian Bell, perhaps the greatest Scottish columnist ever, now sadly dead at too young an age and a loss to us all Donald Cowie, an unassuming and charming sports editor Trevor Royle, a quintessential gentleman and military historian who became the paper\u0026rsquos diplomatic editor Chris Furlong, a former soldier turned photographer with the eye of an artist and a big, kind, happy heart former BBC anchor Iain Macwhirter, a man who knows more about Scottish politics than just about anyone alive Pat Kane, pop star turned public intellectual and Simon Stuart, a chief sub-editor who subjected copy to linguistic forensics and had a gift for hollering the most inventive expletives should a split infinitive or unnecessary pluperfect tense ever cross his desk \u0026ndash the man was a veritable Profanisaurus he\u0026rsquos now an acclaimed psychologist after leaving journalism.  There were so many people, and so much talent over the years, that it is impossible to include everyone \u0026ndash but the early team was very special almost like a little family. The team bonded quickly and supported each other like siblings, remaining friends to this day. It was a cast of characters that could have stepped off the pages of Evelyn Waugh\u0026rsquos Scoop.  Once recruited, the team gathered together before Christmas 1998 in the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash the old Herald building on Albion Street. As its nickname suggests, this towering strange, black tile and glass, art deco-meets-brutalist monster was as charming as its namesake KGB prison in Moscow. The team holed up on the top floor \u0026ndash in a building that smelled of bad canteen food and cigarettes. Cigarettes played a major part in the early days with most staff taking it in turns to hang out of the toilet window for a lightning quick drag on a fag before racing back to their desks to finish a 12-hour day.  If the bricks and mortar were less than salubrious \u0026ndash the new Sunday Herald office was something different, something very modern: it was the first newsroom kitted out in day-glow iMacs, each desk dotted with a neon green, blue or red computer. Staff soon learned that each byline would be printed in the paper with an email address beneath. It may seem quaint now \u0026ndash but this was cutting edge, and it represented something very democratic, a way for readers to directly communicate with the writers in their paper of choice.  Staff at The Herald and the Evening Times \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos other sister paper \u0026ndash kept their distance, suspicious  both of what changes the new paper might usher in for them, and of the loosening of corsets on the top floor. Not all Sunday Herald staff came to work in a shirt and tie, or a nice two-piece ladies\u0026rsquo business suit. There were strange rumours that some staff at the Sunday Herald were seen wearing jeans and even \u0026hellip trainers. This was Generation X taking over the newsroom, and not everyone was chuffed about it.  The Sunday Herald even had its own dedicated entrance at the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash the separation was intentional, in order to preserve the distinct identity of the paper, but also so such sights as staff coming to work listening to headphones would not cause mass disgust on the other floors.  Before the first edition rolled off the presses in early 1999, all staff got together for a mass briefing from editor Andrew Jaspan. \u0026ldquoI wanted to make sure everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet, he says. The vision which Jaspan laid out to staff was this: the paper is being born at the fag end of the 20th century, so look forward, not back \u0026ndash embrace change and challenge yourself and despite the changing and increasingly hectic and atomised way we live our lives in modern Scotland, Sunday remains a day distinct from the rest of the week, it is a day of relaxation, play, family and food \u0026ndash so amuse readers, give them some laughs along with the heavy news. Sunday newspaper readers are also notoriously promiscuous \u0026ndash hopping into bed with one paper one week because a free CD is being given away, but picking up a different paper the following week because of an investigation or big celebrity interview \u0026ndash so we had to give them a reason to fall in love and stay with us.  Jaspan had a few nice little metaphors to throw in as well. A Sunday newspaper is different, staff recall him saying, because the reader isn\u0026rsquot reading their paper on the train or over a hurried breakfast, they are reading the paper over a leisurely lunch, or at home on the couch, or even naked, in bed. \u0026ldquoArouse them! Jaspan hollered. Sunday papers, Jaspan knew, relied on an element of \"theatre\" \u0026ndash journalism is the lowest rung of show business after all \u0026ndash so the Sunday Herald needed to stand out, be different and make readers stop and think.  Finally, Jaspan, told his team, everything could be boiled down to the four \"I\u0026rsquos\" \u0026ndash the paper must be independent of thought, intelligent, international in outlook and, when needed, irreverent to authority.  That was it \u0026ndash the staff had a few weeks to go before the revised launch date, February 7 1999, so they better go off and start finding stories and thinking up some good ideas. The next two Sundays saw the team work on two dummy editions of the paper, making sure the production system was right, that stories were being filed on time, and that the whole thing knitted together in one seamless chain from newsroom to corner shop. There was one casualty in those few weeks before the paper went live \u0026ndash a section head who was just a little bit out of their depth, and left before the heat in the kitchen got too hot for them. My one abiding memory of this time is of being cheated out of a cracking story I\u0026rsquod written making it onto the news stands. Our final dummy paper was to have a print run of less than 100 so staff \u0026ndash and only staff \u0026ndash could see what an actual physical edition of the Sunday Herald would look like. We spent Saturday as a live news day \u0026ndash each of us doing our jobs as if the paper would be in the shops the next morning. My beat was crime and terrorism. Around noon, I got a call that a big paramilitary player in Northern Ireland had been killed. I hit the phones and got details on the murder, the killers, the motive, pictures \u0026ndash the lot. The execs decided the story was the splash \u0026ndash but it was a splash that would never see the light of day."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-heralds-triumph-over-ryan-giggs-super-injunction","story":"  Walker is one of the most decent and honest people you can meet, so it\u0026rsquos no surprise to hear how candid and even humble he was about assuming the role. \u0026ldquoIt was intimidating, he said, \u0026ldquoAndrew\u0026rsquos were a very big pair of shoes to fill.  Walker was given a \u0026ldquosort of life coach by the new owners of the Sunday Herald, Newsquest, to help him transition into the role of editor \u0026ndash a big, difficult job. The life coach advice was simple \u0026ndash do something to stamp your own mark on the paper, to make it your own.  So, heeding those words, Walker took the most modern of papers and added a little extra top spin of modernity \u0026ndash dropping the old broadsheet format and making the paper a compact. Tabloid in shape, broadsheet in style, delivery, tone and content.  Seasoned journalists from other titles had joined the Sunday Herald and were leaving their indelible mark on the paper. Kevin McKenna, one of the smoothest operators in Scottish journalism and a man with a contacts book most hacks would die for, arrived before Jaspan\u0026rsquos departure, bringing with him years of experience and deal-making, adding to the gravitas of the paper. In 2006, dogged political editor Paul Hutcheon won highly-deserved plaudits for investigations revealing that David McLetchie, then leader of the Scottish Tories, had abused taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to pay for taxi fares for legal and party work. McLetchie later resigned.  We were also now easily attracting star names to the paper. To me one of our all-time great reads was a piece commissioned by David Dick, then sports editor, from Budd Schulberg, the man who wrote the movie On the Waterfront, on Muhammad Ali at 60. A piece worthy of gracing the pages of the best papers in history.  Now well and truly a mature newspaper, with its roots laid down and its infancy long behind it, the years ticked by as they do for all papers \u0026ndash but unlike every other paper, the Sunday Herald has mischief in its DNA and was always looking to take on authority. Let\u0026rsquos fast-forward to May 2011. It was the era of the super-injunction, with the rich and famous able to stop any unsavoury story about them being published.  Years before, the Sunday Herald had flouted a super-injunction over a story relating to a member of the royal family. We\u0026rsquod realised that the injunction did not run in Scotland as it had been granted in an English court, and I wrote a piece which went on the front page detailing the allegations, much to the delight of Scottish readers and the chagrin of those south of the Border where we did not publish.  In order to not flout English law we did not run the story online. Given that this story which you are reading is going to run online, I can\u0026rsquot go into details of the royal piece \u0026ndash but I am sure you can find it if you go to a good Scottish library.  In 2011, however, thanks to Twitter and Facebook, most people knew the names of the rich and famous who\u0026rsquod taken out super-injunctions as well as the reasons for taking them out. I was head of news back then and mid-way through a long Saturday afternoon, Richard Walker and I started reminiscing about the royal story and the fact that the Sunday Herald had been able to ignore a super-injunction in the past because of the gap between English and Scottish law.  I think the look of gleeful recognition crossed his face before mine, but within minutes Walker was on the phone to lawyer \u0026ndash Paul McBride, a man who wore his swagger like a suit, but was loved by pretty much everyone who knew him. Sadly, he died too young, still in his mid-40s while on a trip to Pakistan some years back. Yes, the story was entirely doable, said McBride. Within the hour, there was a front page \u0026ndash iconic now you look back on it \u0026ndash of Ryan Giggs with a thin black strip across his eyes and one word \u0026ldquoCensored.  Under any other series of events, this was not a story which the Sunday Herald would have cared much about \u0026ndash the love life of a footballer not being something that we would see as a fit with our readership, or have any public interest issues surrounding it. But this story was in the public interest and it was not about someone\u0026rsquos private life \u0026ndash this was about power and money and fame having undue influence when it comes to the law, and the utter ludicrousness of everyone in the UK who was online knowing the nature of the story and talking about it in pubs and offices and their own homes, while press and broadcasters could not report a single word. The next day Giggs was named in parliament, and the then PM David Cameron said the law needed to catch up with how people consume news in the 21st century.  Walker says he woke up on the Sunday we published the story and thought \u0026ldquowhat the hell have I done, but it was to go on to be one of the crowning achievements of his editorship, putting the Sunday Herald at the centre of a national debate about wealth, privacy and privilege.  By now, the Sunday Herald was following a political trajectory similar to many of our readers. Like many of our readers, we were liberal, progressive and we had fallen out of love with the Labour Party. The SNP \u0026ndash buoyed in many eyes by its valiant opposition to the Iraq War \u0026ndash seemed to offer an alternative home to those of a progressive persuasion. As a paper which had championed devolution, it was \u0026ndash as it was for many of our readers \u0026ndash only an intellectual hop, skip and a jump to supporting independence.  \u0026ldquoIt was a natural progression,\" says Walker, who was editor when the Sunday Herald became the only paper to back Yes in 2014. Not all members of staff supported independence and some were undecided \u0026ndash but as Walker says: \u0026ldquoA member of staff\u0026rsquos politics are up to them. We weren\u0026rsquot inspecting political identity cards, that\u0026rsquos for sure. People are free to think as they please \u0026ndash but the vast majority of our staff did support independence.  Walker\u0026rsquos rationale wasn\u0026rsquot solely about nailing our political colours to the mast \u0026ndash it was also about democracy and plurality of the press. \u0026ldquof we hadn\u0026rsquot come out for independence, can you imagine what the referendum would have been like? Not one paper supporting a position held by 45 per cent of the population. It would have been deeply wrong, he says.  And so came one of our most famous front pages \u0026ndash obviously loved and hated in equal measure, certainly by a margin of 45 to 55 - the \u0026ldquoSunday Herald says Yes. The decision to back Yes saw our sales sky-rocket for a while, before falling back to where they were. Like all papers, the schisms and riffs thrown up by the referendum hurt the Sunday Herald. It doesn\u0026rsquot take a genius to look at Scotland post-referendum and see a population which has one of the lowest levels of trust in the press and broadcasters anywhere in the Western world \u0026ndash which is a terrible shame because this country has produced some of the finest, most honest and brave journalists anywhere in the world.  In the wake of the success of the Sunday Herald backing independence, Newsquest decided to go for the idea of setting up an avowedly pro-independence paper \u0026ndash a paper which became The National. I was deputy editor of the Sunday Herald by this time and Walker was trying to juggle his day job as editor while planning to launch The National as well. I tried to take some burden off him at the Sunday, and myself and other senior members of the Sunday Herald executive team tried to help him as much as we could with The National launch. It was an exhausting and brutally gruelling period of work.  Walker says of The National: \u0026ldquoThe Sunday Herald was a paper which gradually found itself supporting independence \u0026ndash the support for independence evolved \u0026ndash The National is a newspaper set up specifically to support independence. That\u0026rsquos the key difference.  Not long after the launch of The National, Walker stepped down as Sunday Herald editor and left the company. \u0026ldquoI was knackered, he said. \u0026ldquoI needed a break. After he stepped down, I became editor."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-led-the-way-with-911-reports","story":"  The style and tone of the paper was also perfectly underscored by the release of a series of languid, aspirational TV adverts that focused on the imagined lifestyle of our readers \u0026ndash beautiful, intelligent people having croissants and coffee in bed while reading the Sunday Herald. The ads ran over a tune by a little known singer called Dido \u0026ndash back then she was cool, pretty much unknown, and on the verge of working with Eminem.  What any new paper needs, though, is a story that both tests it and proves what it stands for \u0026ndash and for the Sunday Herald that story came in the year 2000 in the shape of Section 28, which sought to ban the \"promotion of homosexuality in schools\". It was a pernicious piece of legislation backed by the most reactionary elements in Scottish society.  Richard Walker, then assistant editor and head of production, says: \u0026ldquoSection 28 showed exactly what we stood for and what we were against. It showed we were a liberal paper, a progressive paper, a paper with values young people could identify with \u0026ndash a paper that represented modern Scotland and the direction that modern Scotland was going.  We fought the battle just as brutally as the opposition \u0026ndash because we knew we were on the side of the angels. When it came to Section 28, Iain Macwhirter led on the opinion front, and I did a lot of work in news. I do recall one big name on the \"Keep the Clause\" side \u0026ndash who felt pretty wounded by Macwhirter\u0026rsquos commentary and my reporting \u0026ndash telling one of the senior executives to \"rein in your f**king left-wing attack dogs Macwhirter and Mackay \u0026ndashor they\u0026rsquoll get their legs broken\".  An idle, silly threat that they neither meant nor had the means nor guts to carry out \u0026ndash but such macho posturing was indicative of how polarising this debate was in Scottish society.  With the repeal of Section 28, the Sunday Herald had a win under its belt, and had shown its mettle and values. The biggest test was yet to come, however \u0026ndash Tuesday, September 11, 2001.  Both David Pratt and I had done a lot of work on al-Qaeda. Pratt had reported from Afghanistan many times since the Soviet invasion and knew the area and its people and culture intimately. He\u0026rsquod even met and drank tea with Osama bin Laden, when the terrorist leader was just another mujahideen commander. I had long covered terrorism, especially Irish terrorism, and once peace began to lay down roots in Northern Ireland, I had turned my attention to Islamist terror, as had many of my best contacts in the intelligence services, the police and military \u0026ndash which is why, one quiet Saturday in August 1999, not long after the paper had started, I was ringing around ious intelligence sources looking for a story when I spoke to a CIA officer I knew in Pakistan. He told me that he\u0026rsquod heard of a plot by al-Qaeda to hit America with planes. We didn\u0026rsquot have anything that made a splash that day \u0026ndash so two years before 9-11, the Sunday Herald ran a front page warning about intelligence fears over just such an atrocity.  It\u0026rsquos little wonder, then, when those planes ploughed into the World Trade Centre in the early afternoon of a crystal-clear Tuesday in September that Pratt and I knew immediately that Osama bin Laden\u0026rsquos al-Qaeda terror network was behind the attacks. It may sound strange now, but few people, even in journalism or politics, had a clue who bin Laden or al-Qaeda were back then. The work Pratt and I had already done gave us a head start on the opposition. Come Sunday, the team had put together a 16-page supplement on the attacks which was better than anything the rest of the UK press had done, and rivalled anything the best of the US press had done as well. It went on to win countless awards for reporting, design and photography. Remembering the front page image still chills me \u0026ndash an incredible, haunting shot, showing the first tower in flames and far away, a tiny plane soaring in from the right of the page heading for the second tower. It was, as Jaspan said, \u0026ldquoa great first draft of history.  Our next big test would come in the form of a special project I was working on: the dirty war in Northern Ireland, investigating collusion between British intelligence and security forces and terrorist double agents in both the IRA and loyalist terrorist organisations. The work saw us name the Scottish army officer accused of being behind much of the dirty war \u0026ndash Brigadier Gordon Kerr we discovered the innocent civilians who died as a result of collusion we revealed the crimes abetted by agents of the British state and, finally, the reporting culminated in the naming of the British army\u0026rsquos highest ranking spy inside the IRA \u0026ndash agent Stakeknife, aka Freddie Scappaticci. But it was a long and dangerous slog.  My adventures in the stygian world of Irish terrorism stay with me as some of the most dangerous experiences in my life. I had a mock execution carried out on me by a drunken terrorist commander I was kidnapped and driven around for hours with a bag over my head by paramilitaries I almost had my cover blown while undercover at a gunman\u0026rsquos funeral. Alongside the danger, the British Government harried the Sunday Herald and opposed us every step of the way. We were gagged by the MoD over our reporting of collusion at one point, and Jaspan was on the receiving end of glacial calls from MI5. But we persevered, and kept our eyes on the prize \u0026ndash getting the truth out.  Much of this work would have been impossible without the legal mind of David McKie, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos lawyer and a much-loved member of the team. He fought tooth and nail to help us get the truth out \u0026ndash and he met every moment of pressure with grace, guts and a wicked sense of humour.  Again, we came back from the fight with arms full of awards but, to me at least, this was a story about more than awards, this was a story which asked questions almost too dark to pose about what the British state and government had been up to in Ireland. It questioned the very nature of British democracy \u0026ndash and it found it lacking.  The Dirty War investigations of the early 2000s were sobering reading for anyone who cared about \"what Britain stood for\" \u0026ndash and they set the paper up for its next big standoff with authority, the push for war against Iraq by the Blair government in late 2002 and into 2003.  The Sunday Herald has only had three editors \u0026ndash Jaspan, Walker and me, but all of us believe the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos opposition to the Iraq war stands as our proudest and most important moment. Each week, in the run-up to the invasion, we systemically dismantled the lies behind the Bush and Blair governments\u0026rsquo push for war.  I spoke to spies, military brass,  and weapons inspectors who poured scorn on everything Washington and London were saying David Pratt drew on years of on-the-ground reporting throughout the Middle East to explain exactly what the context of the trammel for war was \u0026ndash and why it was wrong Trevor Royle synthesised the thinking of the world\u0026rsquos top diplomats and, as so often when it came to the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos most determined efforts, both Iain Macwhirter and Ian Bell expressed in elegant opinion and analysis why it was all so utterly, terribly immoral. Jaspan and Walker shaped and moulded the paper to give the journalism the best platform any writer could ever hope for. As an aside \u0026ndash remember the Dodgy Dossier? We had it first \u0026ndash the only problem is for a Sunday paper that if you get a scoop midweek, there\u0026rsquos a chance you lose it by the weekend. This one we lost.  The vast bulk of the British press was supine over Iraq \u0026ndash at worst colluding with the Blair government in its lies . Apart from , we were the only paper really standing up against the war party \u0026ndash and it paid dividends. Online, our journalism became required reading for an estimated one million American readers every week \u0026ndash readers who were getting from us what they could not get from their own US papers.  The international success of this type of Sunday Herald journalism inspired both David Pratt and me to write our first non-fiction books \u0026ndash championed and supported by Jaspan. Pratt\u0026rsquos on the Israel-Palestine conflict, mine on the Iraq War.  A few days ago, Richard Walker and I were chatting about the life of the Sunday Herald, and we both agreed the Iraq War changed everything and helped mould the future course, not just of Britain, Scotland and the rest of the world, but also of the Sunday Herald. There was a revulsion that Westminster could have let this happen, horror at the lies pumped into the body politic, an utter disenchantment with the New Labour project, and a sense that maybe Scotland could do things differently, better. It was disgust over the war in Iraq, some argue, that helped sow the seeds of what would become the independence movement. The sense of a broken, corrupted British state was a great fertiliser for separatism.  Come 2004, with the paper now five years old, it had shown itself to be an intelligent, combative, campaigning paper that knew exactly what it stood for. At the end of those five years, Jaspan was to leave as editor of the Sunday Herald, to take up a new position as editor of the Age newspaper in Australia \u0026hellip but not before he threw the biggest party in newspaper history."},{"url":null,"title":"elaine-c-smith-and-david-hayman-among-the-celebrities-saying-their-goodbyes-to-the-sunday-herald","story":"  Farewell dear friend, I\u0026rsquove loved you since you were born and over the last twenty years, my God where does time go, I have watched you grow and mature and take your rightful place in our lives.  You were a breath of fresh air, you came with integrity, you came with courage, you were unafraid of your own voice or the choices you made. You, quite simply, raised the bar and set standards others can only dream of.  My Sundays will be bereft without you, without the joy of reading you from cover to cover excited at what I might find as I turn the page. Alas, no more will you shine your light but the voices of those who made you unique are still with us and long may they be heard for they are needed more than ever.  Elaine C Smith, actor and comedian  The Sunday Herald has been a staple in our home since it started and has kept many a paper boy or girl delivering to us every Sunday. It\u0026rsquos the only newspaper that we continued to have delivered \u0026ndash the demise of the habit of buying a newspaper every day is evident, with people getting their news in so many different ways now \u0026ndash but our loyalty to the Sunday herald continued.  It continued for me because in so many ways its political commentary kept me sane. In a world of right wing Labour and Tory opinion in Scotland  the Sunday Herald was a beacon of light.  Not because it was/is pro Scottish independence  but because it tried to present an alternative view and that was like a breath of fresh air. Under the editor Richard Walker, the paper took brave steps. A country that has at least 45 per cent of its people supporting Independence having no newspaper representing or even covering that view would have been ludicrous. Columnists like Iain McWhirter stepping out at a time when all the fire was aimed at the Independence movement was a brave step and as many have found in this wee nation  when you step out from those who have run things for a long time then you are shunned, or ex communicated.  So, I feel sad that things are moving and that there is no more Sunday Herald but am pleased the National on Sunday is being printed and that will be the paper in my house from now on.  Ruth Wishart, journalist, broadcaster and commentator  When the Sunday Herald took the decision to back independence it did so against a media backdrop which was at best neutral and, more commonly, openly hostile to the concept.  It seemed to me vital that a major title should give voice to a cause supported by hundreds and thousands of Scots, and to offer support for and reportage on the Independence campaign.  It has of course mounted many other campaigns and provided space for thought provoking essays and columns.  Often these have been rather more left field than more conventional publications in the mainstream media, and all the more welcome for it. We need diversity in journalism as much as we do elsewhere.  On a more personal level I was delighted to participate in the judging for the Sunday Herald Culture Awards, which helped recognise the myriad talents flourishing throughout the country in every art form.  I will reserve judgement on the Herald on Sunday until I read it. But Sundays just won\u0026rsquot be the same without my Sunday Herald fix.  Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, historian  Over nearly two decades the Sunday Herald has become an important and stimulating addition to the Scottish ?newspaper scene.  The decision taken in 2014 to lend support to the cause of independence was not only courageous but of positive benefit to Scottish democracy. Whatever one\u0027s political view, it was surely unhealthy for the press to be overwhelmingly committed to a unionist position when the nation itself was split over the central Scottish constitutional issue of our time.  This is especially so since the question of the future of the country was not finally laid to rest by the result of the referendum of 2014 and remains alive to this day.  In that sense all democrats should applaud the fact that the Sunday Herald gave some voice to a nationalist perspective without at any time becoming a propaganda sheet either for the SNP or the pro-independence movement.  The paper was also fortunate in being led successively by three first class editors in Andrew Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay?. They were all innovative figures in their different ways who ensured that the quality of journalism was always of a high standard.  I much regret the passing of a newspaper with such a distinctive editorial line? and fresh approach as the Sunday Herald, especially in light of the current difficult times for the Scottish press more generally. We can only hope that some at least of the traditions of the paper are maintained by its successor each Sunday.  Stuart Cosgrove, writer and broadcaster  The Sunday Herald came of age at a time when I was travelling extensively. It was mostly to cities across the UK but often on research trips to America too. I remember coming across a piece of trivia that has stayed with me ever since. It was a minor bit of detail about the pioneering Motown acts who travelled the deep south of America in the days when racial segregation was still the norm. To protect their stage shoes and to keep them in touch with home, groups like The Temptations and The Supremes would roll-up pages from the Michigan Chronicle, Detroit\u0027s major black newspaper. Otis Williams of the Temptations once said that when he was bored or missing home he would unravel the crumpled paper in his shoes and read about Detroit.  For me it was the Sunday Herald. I was home to appear on radio every Saturday and the next day began my travels again. So, I would religiously buy the Sunday Herald, fold it into my bag and once or twice in an act of Motown mimicry even stuffed a section in my trainers. It was the paper that kept me in touch, reminded me of home and spoke to my hopes and dreams, it seemed effortlessly left-of-centre, supportive of an independent Scotland and connected to the exciting cultural developments that made me want to spend more time at home.  Josh Littlejohn, founder of Social Bite  The Sunday Herald has been a massive supporter of our organisation Social Bite and has always championed the need to tackle social causes. The publication has covered Social Bite\u0027s journey over the last six years which has helped us raise awareness and funds to help homeless people throughout Scotland.  The Sunday Herald also recognised our Sleep in the Park event with a special award at their Culture Awards, for which we were touched and honoured. I would like to thank everyone in the team for their legacy to us and many organisations like ours over the years.  Aamer Anwar, human rights lawyer  I first got involved with the paper back in 1999 when we began the campaign for justice for the murder victim Surjit Singh Chhokar. The Sunday Herald carried our campaign week after week, building a relationship with the family and caring little about the powerful institutions which desperately tried to silence us. The paper was a key player in helping us get justice 18 years later. For that one issue which placed victim\u0026rsquos rights at the heart of the criminal justice system you can be immensely proud.  But looking back over the years, there have been so many issues and campaigns that I have worked on with the paper on that it\u0026rsquos hard to pick the most memorable. There was articles about the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody the corrupt Counter Corruption Unit at Police Scotland the betrayal of justice for Emma Caldwell the ticking timebomb of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. You even supported me when I was placed on trial for speaking out against a miscarriage of justice or faced death threats from \u0026lsquoIslamic\u0026rsquo extremists.  On so many levels your journalists have shown immense courage and compassion but you also gave us hope in the words you wrote. What compliment can I give to so many of you who worked this paper, other than to say you really made a difference to Scotland. There are so many ordinary people without powerful friends or money to rely upon, who would have been pushed aside, silenced and crushed had you not been there with your campaigning journalism.  It makes me incredibly sad to see you go, but on a personal level I just want to say thank you so much for being there for myself, the families and campaigns in our darkest hours. We always knew if we picked up the phone you could be relied upon for your unconditional support. Good luck my friends.  Hugh MacDonald, writer and broadcaster  There was, at first, a distance between us. The Sunday Herald lived above The Herald on Albion Street, below it on Renfield Street. We then grew close. Long before the Sunday Herald moved its digs to join The Herald on the same floor, I \u0026ndash a perennial daily hack - had made the occasional contribution to its pages. These dalliances became more of a regular relationship. These pieces generally represented what I liked about the Sunday Herald.  First, they were interesting. At least in their commissioning. I did my best to knock any intrigue from them. But articles were sought from me on such as the secrets of the confessional, the curious lack of professed gay footballers, and the importance of geography in American crime writing. They were typical of how the Sunday Herald sought to investigate the corners as well as the broad floor of politics, culture or sport.  Secondly, the editing was first class. Kathleen Morgan, the best journalist in Scotland never to have edited a national newspaper, produced a stunning magazine that her successor, Jane Wright, maintained to the highest standard. Susan Flockhart was a brilliant, insightful editor of copy. Any piece emerged better from her examination. This is a tribute born of personal experience.  There was a sense of gallusness about the Sunday Herald, too, never better illustrated by a front page that may have featured Ryan Giggs. Or maybe not. It also allowed some latitude. I began to write more sports pieces  and more book reviews, commissioned by Rosemary Goring, a peerless literary editor.  The rein was so free it could have been a four. I was allowed to write a preview to the 2012 Olympics that consisted of the first verse of London Calling, with slight amendments. It was fun. At least for me.  But best of all, it was independent. It informed you without apology about what it believed was important. It told you what it thought and it oft times took extraordinary criticism for that seeming impertinence. I loved that then. I mourn it now that it is gone.  Katie Archibald, columnist and champion racing cyclist  I first wrote for the Sunday Herald in 2014, the year of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The sports section had a weekly column written by a rotation of six Scottish athletes, all aspiring to Commonwealth success that year. It was a logbook of the highs and lows of lives consumed by sport. The column didn\u0026rsquot retell the happenings of races, matches and galas, but instead revealed the recipes behind our victories, confessed the insecurities muddled into our losses, and gave the insider view on sports controversies.  The Commonwealth Games came and with it the end to these six stories, whether they finished as fairy tales or not. But somehow, I continued writing in the paper. For me, the Sunday Herald was a platform to talk about cycling. It was inches on a page to entertain people and to subtly convince everyone to get on a bike, and for that opportunity I am very grateful. I was one small voice in the countless that were given the chance to be heard in this paper. The Sunday Herald will be missed.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice Chancellor, University of Glasgow  A healthy and provocative press is essential to the wellbeing of democratic debate and one of the great strengths, and I hope enduring legacies of the Sunday Herald, was the space provided for all shades of comment and opinion. In my own case I was pleased to engage with the editorial team, sometimes to offer just a line or two to a story but more often to contribute my thoughts and my perspective on often complex and challenging issues. From the Fiscal Framework to the economic consequences of Brexit for Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, I was encouraged to provide clarity and explanation. At a time of controversy over what is real and what is fake news, and against a continuing backdrop of those who still say we should not listen to experts I believe with great conviction that it is more important than ever that different and diverse opinions are given their place in our press."},{"url":null,"title":"chairman-mao-unfair-play-a-grave-undertaking-blasphemyand-a-flying-fish-supper","story":"  As this newspaper passes away and a new one is in gestation just a week before delivery, we\u0026rsquore beaten to the punch by the launch of The Herald this Thursday. It\u0026rsquos what Donald Trump would call a fake newspaper. It features in a new six-part BBC drama, Press, as a stately broadsheet, sharing the building with its sleazy tabloid sister called The Post, set in the internet age. It\u0026rsquos written by the screenwriter of the lauded Doctor Foster. There\u0026rsquos violence, sexual infidelity, illegal drug-taking, petty jealousies, bullying, duplicity and bribery \u0026ndash and I guess that will feature in the fictional Herald too.  Actually, newspapers have changed out of all recognition from the rumbustious, hard-drinking, highly-competitive, brawling, character-filled days before 24-hour news and social media mauled circulation and advertising revenues. But these days are something the one-time, short-lived editor of the Daily Mirror, Roy Greenslade, knows about. He\u0026rsquos the editorial adviser on Press, as well as being a journalism professor, and Roy has gone through his own highly-dramatic reinvention. I remember him as a Red Book carrying Maoist, a member of the Communist Party of Britain  which backed China in the spit with the Soviet Union and then Albania\u0026rsquos despot Enver Hoxha. Greenslade used to stupefy NUJ meetings and conferences with his quotes from the chairman and calls for class warfare, but while Mao anticipated Twitter by keeping his pronouncements to under 140 words Roy was under no such stricture. Later he moved rightwards and, for a time, became Alastair Campbell\u0026rsquos best pal. None of which will feature in the new show.  RAIL LINES AND SICK NOTES  Some ScotRail services were disrupted on Thursday because of an unexpected rash of illnesses to staff. Unexpected? Just check the fixture list. Celtic and Rangers were both playing in the Europa League. Could it be true? Unexpected becoming expected with crucial staff taking sickies to watch the games? Only the travelling public suffered and, whatever the reason for the mysterious bout of lurgy, no doubt the company management and the RMT union will have nothing to say about the inconvenience.  FAIR SCUNNERED  Betfair? It\u0026rsquos a breach of the Trade Descriptions Act. I like the occasional wager, it makes TV sport more interesting as well as politics, but all in moderation of course. I\u0026rsquove done it online through Betfair for the last eight years or so. No longer. A few days ago, with my account in credit I tried to put on a bet \u0026ndash which would have netted me \u0026pound150,000, or so my lawyers will argue \u0026ndash and got the message that the account was suspended. There had been no warning, no email, letter, call or carrier pigeon.  The woman on the phone couldn\u0026rsquot tell me why but insisted that I now had to provide photo ID, proof of address as well as funding. Being a curmudgeon I refused, and said just close the account and put my winnings into the bank account from which I\u0026rsquove always deposited money. She said she would. But of course it didn\u0026rsquot happen. So I called again a few days later and asked where my cash was, to be told I couldn\u0026rsquot get my own money back until I had sent them a scan of my passport, the deeds of my house, the details of my bank account so they could verify I had money, as well as a DNA sample. I exaggerate, but only slightly.  Now some might think that providing sensitive and potentially usable information to a company is fine, but not me. It\u0026rsquos my money and I want it. I serve notice on Betfair that I shall be referring this to the Gambling Commission, taking them to the small claims court  and launching a judicial review on their practices. I will, of course, be crowdfunding that.  DYING TO REPRESENT YOU  You wouldn\u0026rsquot think lawyers would need second jobs  but some of them certainly do, from driving lorries to opening restaurants, none more bizarrely than Glasgow lawyer Stephen Fox, who defends people during the week and buries them at the weekend. He\u0026rsquos a partner in undertakers Malone and Fox which has three places in the city. Well, the competition is stiff!  Boom and bust  Early last week I was in court to hear the eloquent QC Gary Allan, a man who has been called one of the finest legal brains in Scotland. In 2012 he was one of a three-man panel which imposed a transfer ban and a substantial fine on Rangers, then in administration. The panel members were supposed to be kept secret but after then-manager Ally McCoist demanded to know their names, and in the fervid atmosphere, they were leaked. Allan then received credible death threats. Just weeks later, of course, Rangers went bust and a couple of years later Allan went the same way and declared himself bankrupt with debts of more than \u0026pound200,000. Ironic, although I doubt Gary finds it so.  WILLIE\u0026rsquoS A RIGHT CARD  Willie Collum is a religious education teacher, which is fine. He\u0026rsquos also a football referee, which is not. He\u0026rsquos a card sharp, whipping them out like he\u0026rsquos playing the crowd at a conjuring convention. He was at it at Rugby Park last Saturday when he precipitately sent Kilmarnock\u0026rsquos Gary Dicker off and ruined what was left of a dire game \u0026ndash and if he does the same in the Old Firm clash today there could be mayhem.  I\u0026rsquove counted the cards over the last five seasons and Collum \u0026ndash excluding this one \u0026ndash has sent off 60 players and booked over 700, brandishing a card roughly every 20 minutes per game. Hearts, who were the beneficiaries of the red card last weekend, even muttered three seasons back that he wasn\u0026rsquot just incompetent he was biased against them, so perhaps he was just rebalancing?  But thank goodness we don\u0026rsquot have the Italian sanctions system or, believe me, there wouldn\u0026rsquot be a player on the park by half-time if teacher Willie was in charge. The Udinese midfielder Rolando Mandragora has just been given a one-game ban for \u0026ndash not going over the ball, play acting or preventing a goal-scoring opportunity \u0026ndash but blasphemy! He was caught on camera mouthing to himself \u0026ldquoDio cane, which is literally, \u0026ldquoGod is a dog, but perhaps better translates to something like \u0026ldquoJesus f*****g Christ. Willie just wouldn\u0026rsquot be having that.  AND FINALLY ...  Andrew Jaspan, the founding father of this newspaper, writes elsewhere in these pages. But I\u0026rsquom sure he won\u0026rsquot be mentioning the time when, cycling home in Edinburgh, someone driving past hit him slap in the coupon with a fish supper. Or the night when he was locked in the loo for four hours calling for help . He was a brilliant and fastidious editor, although exasperating at times, as all the good ones are. I was there at the launch of the paper and now at its end. The feeling of sadness, and there certainly is that, is overwhelmed by all of the great memories.  The paper launched on a dreich February 7, 1999, from the old Express building, the Northern Lubyanka in Glasgow\u0026rsquos Albion Street, where I had worked in a previous life. We all had those new-fangled iMacs, the bulbous blue ones, on our desks and somehow it all worked. Sitting in the chair next to me was the polymath and chanter Pat Kane, although I can\u0026rsquot recall him ever giving us a song. I\u0026rsquoll stop before it gets maudlin. It\u0026rsquos been marvellous. It really has. But on with the future."},{"url":null,"title":"lana-del-ray-cancels-israel-concert","story":"  In a Twitter message Del Rey said she is delaying \"until a time when I can schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans\".

But it marked a setback for Israel, which aims to prevent politics from infiltrating the arts.  Del Rey was to headline the inaugural Meteor Festival in northern Israel next week.

With newspaper circulation figures in decline and an increasing desire for 24/7 \"bite-sized\" information dominating the presentation of news around the world, there continues to be big name casualties along the way.  Over almost 20 years, the first years of devolution, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos editorial team has broken stories, campaigned for sometimes unpopular causes and displayed editorial bravery by challenging authority at every level.  While Scottish Labour and the Sunday Herald have held very different views on the constitution in recent years, there is a common commitment to a fairer society, one which tackles poverty and eradicates inequality.  In the week that Scottish Labour revealed that the number of children living in poverty, despite having a parent in work, has soared to 40,000 across Scotland: a figure even worse if the parents could only find part-time jobs, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos focus on social and economic conditions will be missed.  Now, I cannot say that I have always been in agreement with the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos coverage or its choice of front page stories or headlines, but that\u0026rsquos what happens with a pluralistic press. So, I do accept and will always argue for the right of newspapers to bring stories to their readers which reflect the views of a wide spectrum of our society. And I hope the day will come when there is more diversity in ownership and a rekindling of the flame of investigative journalism.  The next few years will be important for all those opposed to continued Tory and SNP austerity. For all those who want to see a real change built upon a redistribution of wealth and power in society, and a refuelling of devolution. For all those people looking for hope in Scottish politics.  The Sunday Herald may no longer be here to report on those political ideas, and that in itself is disappointing, but the many staff who have helped deliver news good and bad and those others who have contributed to the debate on the state of the society we are in can reflect on a job well done.  For those of us in the thick of those debates we know there is much still to do, but winning the battle of ideas and so winning power for change remains my abiding goal."},{"url":null,"title":"patrick-harvie-sadness-at-the-sunday-heralds-passing-but-hope-for-the-future","story":"  Looking back it\u0026rsquos not hard to see the case for a quality Sunday paper to try to bring together a readership that had been traditionally split during the week between The Herald in the west, The Scotsman in the east and the P\u0026ampJ in the north.  Over the years the Scottish Greens have had many opportunities to work with the paper, partly because the readership it successfully cultivated mirrors our own support base \u0026ndash people who care deeply about social justice, equalities and the environment, and who want Scottish politics to set about the radical agenda which inspired so many to campaign together to create Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament.  We\u0026rsquove often felt that the Sunday Herald has reflected values important to us. The paper\u0026rsquos eye-catching support for independence had solid reasoning, echoing what many Greens were saying at the time. \u0026ldquoWe believe independence is the only way to achieve a more progressive, fair and equitable society \u0026ndash not because independence is an end in itself, an editorial stated.  Ahead of the 2016 Holyrood election, everyone knew the party of government was unlikely to change, so the question became which of the other parties would be able to influence the direction of the parliament and hold ministers to account. The Sunday Herald pinned its colours to the mast, calling for a \u0026ldquostrengthened group of Green MSPs, with the government \u0026ldquocritiqued and pushed from a progressive position.  In February this year, following a budget deal that prevented cuts to local government and brought in a fairer system of income tax, the paper said: \u0026ldquoThe Greens should be congratulated for the intelligent, constructive and democratic role they played. If only more political parties engaged with each other in such a way. Greens are often in the vanguard of political change.  So we\u0026rsquore immensely grateful for the role the Sunday Herald has played, especially on some of the issues we\u0026rsquove been focused on.  Perhaps the strongest signal it has sent in recent years has been its retention of an environment editor, keeping crucial issues such as climate change, fracking, corporate polluters, nuclear convoys, fox hunting and salmon farming on the agenda. It has also maintained an investigations editor, clearly recognising the benefit of giving journalists time to deep-dive for stories that would otherwise never see the light of day.  Over the years I\u0026rsquove been interviewed by political editors from Douglas Fraser during the \u0026ldquorainbow parliament of 2003-07 through to Tom Gordon, Andrew Whitaker and Paul Hutcheon. It\u0026rsquos been encouraging to see the paper giving prominence to equalities and civil liberties issues, from equal marriage to phone hacking.  There is also a potential Sunday Herald legislative legacy in the pipeline, as the paper has campaigned in support of my colleague Mark Ruskell\u0026rsquos bill to create safer streets by reducing the urban speed limit to 20mph. Given the range of political, health expert and safety campaigner support, it has a strong chance of becoming law. As the Sunday Herald said in its editorial in April this year: \u0026ldquoChild safety trumps every argument. A price cannot be put on that.  I\u0026rsquoll be especially sad to see the paper go given the fundamental challenges in today\u0026rsquos media. I believe there\u0026rsquos still a market for people who want substance and depth, and who will repay quality journalism with trust instead of dismissing the media as some kind of conspiracy. So I wish the new Herald on Sunday well, and hope that both online and in print it manages to continue the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos standards. Investment in staff will be crucial to that, and as an MSP I\u0026rsquoll be watching carefully how Newsquest handles the next steps."},{"url":null,"title":"art group at inveruie clan","story":"        A new art group is being launched for anyone affected by cancer in Inverurie.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Flu vaccination consent forms will be arriving home in school bags next week as the autumn term gets underway, which parents need to return within the seven-day window if they wish their child to be vaccinated.                                                    The safe and effective nasal vaccine is the best way to help protect children from flu - it only takes a few minutes and provides protection for around a year.        To date, more than 1.6 million doses of the nasal vaccine have been given to 2-11-year-olds in Scotland, and the vaccine will be offered to 400,000 primary aged children this year as part of the Scottish childhood immunisation programme.The Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Scotland has urged parents to consider getting their child vaccinated, not only to protect them, but to help stop the spread of the virus to others.Dr Gregor Smith, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Scotland said: “Incidences of flu in Scotland rose last winter, which is why we’re advising people to get ready to fight flu ahead of winter hitting.“Flu can be serious, and can result in even healthy children being hospitalised. The vaccine remains the best way to protect your child against flu and its complications, and helps protect those around them who may be vulnerable to flu.                                                                                                        “Primary school children cannot receive their flu vaccination if a signed consent form isn’t returned, so I’d encourage parents to look out for it.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:47

This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:47 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:47 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:47 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 6:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupSunday 2 Sep 2018 6:48 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

So seven days on, where are we? In a deeply depressing place, that’s where. In the interim, a storm has swirled through Scotland, reshaping the political landscape, deepening faultlines and spawning conspiracy theories. Elsewhere in Scotland on Sunday, my colleague Euan McColm is examining the political fall-out the impact of events on the SNP and broader independence movement.            But I want to explore what Salmond’s reaction and the coverage of the story means in the context of #MeToo. What does it show us about power and status and the importance placed on the eradication of the sexual harassment still rife in many workplaces?            When actresses such as Rose McGowan started making allegations about Harvey Weinstein in October last year, it felt as if a dam had burst. Bastions of macho behaviour, such as Westminster and Holyrood, finally began to apply themselves to creating a culture where victims of sexual harassment felt confident enough to come forward.Given last week’s circus, however, that fleeting optimism feels naive. Seeing the way the allegations have been shunted to one side by a iety of diversionary tactics, you can’t help but wonder: what woman would choose to put herself through all this?Before I go any further, I should stress again that I have no view on the validity or otherwise of these particular allegations. Salmond has denied them and is innocent until proven guilty. Nor am I unsympathetic to the plight of those who are falsely accused. It must be a terrible thing to have to defend yourself against offences you have not committed.Nevertheless, in the period since the allegations became public, the former First Minister has engaged in behaviour which could be construed as intimidatory. Of course, he has every right to try to challenge the Scottish Government’s new investigatory procedures through a judicial review, but, whether he realises it or not, his very public mustering of support has implications for all victims of sexual harassment, who must be looking on aghast. What was his crowdfunder, if not a display of power and popularity? As a man who could afford to pay his own legal costs, the message he was sending out is that he was still the big political beast of yore. He has also been casting himself in the role of wronged hero. Take his hashtag #forFairness. No-one who was not directly involved in the Scottish Government investigation can know whether the procedures were properly adhered to. In addition, as law professor James Chalmers has pointed out, the crowdfunder does not make clear which decision Salmond is challenging nor what remedy is being sought. Those who have contributed have signed up less to a specific goal than to a nebulous sense of grievance.             Some have gone further and said they are donating because they believe Salmond. Imagine how diminished these women must feel, seeing scores of SNP supporters rushing to his corner with no possible insight into what he has or hasn’t done. And imagine how offputting it will be for other women still waiting in the wings with their own complaints.This obsession with Salmond’s plight, at the expense of the complainants’, was echoed in some of the newspaper coverage and on social media. There was much eulogising about his achievements which, while undeniable, are irrelevant. Some commentators spoke about “trial by media”, though, thankfully, there has been none of the tabloid character-blackening you used to see pre-Leveson. One high-profile columnist tweeted that Salmond was about to be cast into oblivion by “a couple of lurid front pages”. What a devastating dismissal of serious allegations. And I’m not even convinced it’s true. Last week, stand-up comedian Louis CK received a standing ovation when he appeared at a club nine months after he admitted masturbating in front of women without their consent footballer David Goodwillie – found in a civil case to have raped a woman – plays for Clyde. And these are people who have either admitted or been found guilty of something. If the police inquiry finds there’s no case to answer, it is not inconceivable that Salmond could launch a fresh leadership bid.Alongside these pieces have been others asking what Sturgeon knew and when. Though it is not unreasonable to question the timeline, it does seem odd that in a story about allegations against a man, so many headlines should have been directed at a woman, who has been clear he must be investigated without fear or favour.            This background noise will make little difference to Salmond’s fate. The justice system is not a popularity contest. But the mood music matters none the less. It tells women there has been less progress than they thought that even now – when some are claiming #MeToo has gone too far – it takes nerves of steel to bring allegations of sexual harassment against a public figure. I should address one last issue. Over the past few days, many people have suggested that if I’m so worried about the women involved, I should direct my anger towards the source of the “leak”, which has thrust their allegations on to the front pages. I do have concerns about the way the events unfolded, but like many things in this case, it’s complicated. As I understand it, the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, who led the investigation, sought to make basic details public at the point at which the report was handed to the police, backing off only when Salmond sought an interdict. Presumably, at the point where Evans was poised to make her original statement, the government felt it had a duty to be transparent. Can you imagine the outrage if at a later date it emerged it had been covered up? Whether or not anonymity is ultimately desirable, it is not unusual for those at the centre of a police inquiry to be named and, in any case, it would all have become public as a result of Salmond pursuing the judicial review. The second leak – if indeed they were separate – of the more detailed allegations splashed on the front of the Daily Record last Saturday was, to my mind, far more damaging both to Salmond and to the women. I don’t know who was responsible, and therefore who to call out, but I don’t doubt the source will be investigated at some point.Overall, the whole thing is a terrible, damaging mess. One wee chink of light, though, is the way those repulsed by Salmond’s crowdfunder sought to counter the great-man-brought-low narrative with one of their own. As his crowdfunder easily surpassed its target, they championed donations to women’s aid and rape crisis centres as an alternative.             In a thank-you tweet, Rape Crisis Scotland wrote: “For any woman considering speaking out about abuse or harassment, we say: ‘You are not alone’.” It was a powerful and necessary antidote to so much that had gone before."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793622.1535834974!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader the right to a longer life","story":"        \u0026#8220While life expectancy in Scotland has increased for the past three decades, there has been no change over the last few years.\u0026#8221 The Registrar General\u0026#8217s report on the changes to Scotland\u0026#8217s population is packed full of facts and figures, but the number of years of life we can all expect is surely the most personal, even if it is an estimated average.                 So the news that Scotland’s average life expectancy has stopped rising – while it continues to increase in other European countries – will surely be a concern. Girls born in Scotland between 2014 and 2016 can expect to live for 81.2 years, while their male counterparts can look forward to 77.1 years. These figures have risen by nearly six years for women since the early 1980s and eight years for men. However, the report notes that “over the past few years there has been a slowing in the rate of increase, and there has been virtually no change in either male or female life expectancy... since 2012-2014”.            The decade of austerity since 2008 may provide a partial explanation of the figures. But our increasingly sedentary lifestyles and fondness for sugar, fat and salt – a habit exploited ruthlessly by the manufacturers and sellers of processed food – are also likely to play a part.            According to the Registrar General’s report, the lowest life expectancy is for men living in Glasgow City, at about 73 years, compared with the highest, in Orkney, of about 80. But Glasgow’s figure masks starker divides at a more local level. Life expectancy for men in the city’s most deprived areas is in the mid-50s. And it is this figure which should act as a call to action, rather than the national average.No one born in Scotland, one of the richest countries in the world, should face a life almost predestined to be blighted by ill-health and cut short in middle-age because of the financial circumstances of their parents. Government is unlikely to be able to provide all the answers, but it must provide leadership as collectively as a society we strive to ensure everyone in Scotland has a fighting chance of a long and happy life."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793588.1535824501!/image/image.jpg","title":"mark hoskyns abrahall proud of global role in social change","story":"        Ten years ago this autumn a financial crisis took a grip of the world, leading to a downturn in the global economy from which we are only now beginning to recover on a meaningful level.                From collapses and closures to quantitative easing and bail-outs, the response to the crash was unprecedented it changed business culture and societal attitudes.            As more people required help in making ends meet, it also acted as a catalyst for the rise of the social enterprise movement, which has spent the last decade moving from the fringes of the business community to a more mainstream role.            And next week, from 12-14 September, the three-day Social Enterprise World Forum returns to the city where it all began ten years ago, Edinburgh.Since that event in 2008, social enterprises have worked their way into the psyche of the consumer, through the admirable efforts of dedicated entrepreneurs and tens of thousands of staff and volunteers across the world.While social enterprises have existed for centuries – Aberdeen’s Glencraft was founded in 1843 – today they are truly a global phenomenon. Since that first Forum, it has visited Melbourne, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong, among other great cities.From its beginnings the event aimed to bring together social enterprise leaders and champions from all continents to collaborate, share best practice and plan future developments.Across Scotland we have some incredible social enterprises, from Street Soccer Scotland, which has helped improve the mental health of homeless people through football, to Brewgooder, which is helping deliver clean water to people in Malawi.            In the words of former cabinet secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, who last year launched Scotland’s Social Enterprise Strategy, “Social entrepreneurs are driven by an overriding passion to improve the world in which they live.”Another thing these enterprises have in common is the dedication and vision of their founders, and this is something that all business leaders should be inspired and driven by. These enterprises have a clear purpose, and over the next three days I’m excited to hear what social entrepreneurs from across the world have to say about this growing cultural movement.In Scotland there are now more than 5,600 social enterprises, with around 10 per cent of those formed in the past two years. This is a vibrant sector, adding around £2 billion in value to the Scottish economy.Not only are these enterprises doing great things for those in need, they are setting an example for big business to follow: almost two-thirds are operated by women and the earnings ratio of the lowest paid staff to the highest paid is just 1:2.5.            At PwC we’re taking action to empower communities by supporting social entrepreneurs to create sustainable businesses that enhance social mobility. And we’re backing this as headline sponsor of the Social Enterprise World Forum this year, an event we’ve supported for seven years.Social enterprise has been a key part of our community strategy for more than a decade. In addition to our social enterprise hub in London, we have a social entrepreneurs club which includes 35 Scottish enterprises, covering everything from cycling and football to food and drink, hospitality and co-working spaces.The purpose of this club is to help its members grow businesses and increase their societal impact, in line with global Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were set in 2015 by the United Nations and 193 countries, who agreed to deliver 17 global goals underpinned by 169 specific targets by 2030, in order “to achieve a thriving society in a thriving environment”.With “reducing inequalities” and “decent work and economic growth” listed amongst the goals, it’s clear that social enterprise can make a substantial contribution to achieving them.For Edinburgh to play such a vital role in this by welcoming back the Social Enterprise World Forum, ten years bigger and better, is something we should all take immense pride in.

Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"fagradal lower voe ","story":"Offers over £205,000\n\nThe property is conveniently situated for Brae \u0026amp Sullom Voe, yet Lerwick  is still within easy commuting distance.

The film is then scheduled for general release by makers Netflix on November 9.\nThe Outlaw King, one of the biggest productions made in Scotland, is a historical drama about Robert the Bruce and stars heart-throb Chris Pine in the lead role.\nSecurity was tight while filming was going last September, but teasing clues were left here and there.\nCar parks at the Macdonald Aviemore Highland Resort were commandeered by Winnebago villages for tantalising days where polite security guards could only say there was \"a film being being made\".\nAt one point a beautifully crafted medieval launch glided up and parked itself  at the resort.\nGradually the whole story emerged over the months and now David Mackenzie\u0027s glittering new production is being trumpeted in magazines and on line.\nThe new epic is boosting Scotland\u0027s economy by more than 10 times what the taxpayer has spent on it.\nThe Scottish Government says the film has already generated \u0026pound17.5m and increased employment opportunities nationwide. Cairngorms Business Partnership chief executive Mark Tate said the global exposure provided by such big-budget movies is a huge boost for the local economy.\nThe film itself tells the untold, true story of 14th Century Robert the Bruce who transforms from defeated nobleman to outlaw hero during the oppressive occupation of medieval Scotland by Edward I of England.\nDespite grave consequences, Robert seizes the Scottish crown and rallies an impassioned group of men to fight back against the mighty army of the king and his volatile son, the prince of Wales.\nAlso starring are Scottish actors James Cosmo, Tony Curran, Steven Cree, Chris Fulton and Alistair Mackenzie.\nAnother big-budget movie, Mary Queen of Scots, was also being shot in the strath at the same time.\nThe film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie and David Tennant, is scheduled to be released at the end of this year.\nSunday 2 Sep 2018 6:49 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nSunday 2 Sep 2018 6:49 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

authority\u0026rsquos projected \u0026pound5.1 million overspend for the current year.\nCouncil chiefs insisted no jobs were at risk.\nBut finance director Derek Yule highlighted the critical state of emergency \"reserve\" funds of only \u0026pound8 million, warning there were \"no more rabbits to be pulled from hats\" to solve the problem.\nPolitical rivals then locked horns in an unprecedented clash in the chamber at Inverness headquarters.\nLiberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed successive Scottish Government grant cuts for the council\u0026rsquos financial woes.\nSNP city councillor Richard Laird countered that, directly blaming the council\u0026rsquos independent-led minority administration\u0026rsquos budget decisions.\nMy Yule told committee members he was not surprised by the scale of projected overspend. To put things into context, he said \u0026pound5.1 million equated to only one per cent of the total budget.\nBut he added: \"I have no more rabbits to pull out of the hat to help. We\u0026rsquove looked at a lot of the opportunities for the council and there is nothing else there, so there is no doubt there\u0026rsquos some really challenging, underlying issues that need to be addressed as part of that process.\"\nHe said a comprehensive update on the budget would be presented to next week\u0026rsquos full council meeting.\n\"It does require immediate correction to normal business,\" Mr Yule added. \"The council really needs to challenge what the money is being spent on to make sure it\u0026rsquos being used as effectively as possible.\"\nDefending the administration\u0026rsquos handling of the finances, budget leader Alister Mackinnon said a process of \"robust monitoring\" would mean a monthly update from all departments from now on.\nHe pledged transparency but conceded the current position was \"a wake-up call for all of us\".\nCllr Adam cited a \"2.7 per cent\" UK government grant cut and an \"eight per cent\" grant cut from Scottish Government.\nAnd he said the reduction was worse for Highland, not least because of the high cost of safeguarding a costly portfolio of small schools in remote areas.\nCouncil leader Margaret Davidson claimed that \"local government and the services we deliver are not a priority for the Scottish Government\".\nCllr Laird insisted the crisis was \"entirely of this council\u0026rsquos making\".\nHe accused administration members of failing to read the budget proposals early enough to understand the implications and then, realising car park charges and toilet closures were among them, \"they ran away from it\".\nCllr Mackinnon accused the SNP opposition group of failing to present alternative measures as part of the budget process and has since failed to join a debate on the issues.\nHe said he had offered meetings to group leader Maxine Smith but had been turned down \"because she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her own diary\".\nThe comment incensed SNP councillors. Cllr Smith was not in the chamber to respond.\nSNP group finance spokesman Ian Cockburn rose to his feet, accusing the budget leader of being \"out of order\" with his attack.\nCllr Mackinnon ordered him to sit down, insisting that he was chairing the meeting.\n\"You\u0026rsquove had umpteen opportunities to come back to discuss alternative savings with us, and to date you have not taken advantage of that,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Cllr Smith later said: \"Late afternoon on Friday I received a meeting request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget.\n\"Of course I already had commitments but they weren\u0026rsquot \u0026lsquopersonal\u0026rsquo although even if they were it\u0026rsquos none of his business.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest.

cent, while this figure rises to 80 per cent and above for Art \u0026amp Design, Construction and Polish, and to over 90 per cent for Design \u0026amp Technology, Child Development and Music.  \n\nAll students who took the Prince’s Trust Programme and the Coaching Academy Award have achieved at Grade B.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Knox congratulated all of the school’s Year 12 students on their hard work and success.  \n\n“These results are the culmination of a great deal of hard work on the parts of both students and teachers, and I congratulate each of the students, as well as their teachers,” Dr Knox said.\n\nHe added: “I would also like to thank the parents of the young people, for the encouragement and support they have provided to their children during the two years of their GCSE examinations.\n\n“We are proud of the successes of all of our pupils, who between them have achieved 16 A* grades, 36 As and 177 Bs.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“These are excellent results from children who, in many cases, had enrolled in St Patrick’s College five years ago with their confidence severely dented by the Transfer procedure.  \n\n“I am sure their achievements will give them the confidence and encouragement to go onto further success at A Level.\n\n“In an excellent year for our Modern Languages, I would like to congratulate all of our Irish students, in achieving at Grades A*-C.  \n\n“I also want to recognise the achievement of our Polish students, seven of whom have achieved either an A* or A grade in GCSE Polish, a qualification which will be very useful to them should they return to Poland to continue their studies or seek employment.  \n\n“Finally, I wish to congratulate Marija Sestakova, who has achieved an A* in GCSE Russian.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Overall, these GCSE results, coupled with the excellent results at A Level achieved by our GCE students this year, give us great confidence as a school as we continue to ensure that the students leaving St Patrick’s do so with the highest qualifications they can possibly achieve.”\n\nDr Knox also praised other successes within the Year 12 group, particularly 14 students who have completed the Prince’s Trust course, gaining a Level Two qualification equivalent to two GCSEs at Grade B.  \n\nIn addition, 12 students have achieved Level 2 qualifications in Occupational Studies, equivalent to GCSEs at A*-C.  \n\nHe also congratulated 10 students who have completed the Coaching Academy Award, which is equivalent to four GCSEs at Grade B.\n\n“As a non-selective school, we celebrate success at all levels across the full range of ability,” Dr Knox said.\n\nHe added: “These are vocational courses, many of which our students access through the Northern Regional College, and they aim to broaden the educational experience of the young people, with a view to preparing them for further training or apprenticeships.  \n\n“I am delighted that these students have successfully embraced this opportunity, and I would like to thank the staff of the Northern Regional College for the partnership we enjoy, which is obviously benefiting our students.”\n\nDr Knox wished all of the school’s Year 12 students success in the next stage of their education and welcomed many of them back to begin Sixth Form studies in St Patrick’s. \n            \n    \n    try   catch

80 per cent in the A–C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60 oer cent - in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOverall, almost 80 per cent of students achieved five or more subjects in the A–C range with almost 60 per cent achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths.  \n\nSchool Principal Ruth Wilson said this significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n\n\n   \n                 \n

students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions,” Mrs Wilson added.\n\nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100 per cent of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows:  Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

I\u0027m determined, we\u0027re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite, and Dominic and I think it\u0027s possible to reach that in October.\"\n\nMr Barnier added: \"If you take account of the date chosen by the United Kingdom to leave, that\u0027s March 29 which is in UK law and you simply count backwards the time that you need for ratification about three months here or there then it takes you to November at the latest. It\u0027s as simple as that.\"\n\nIt follows concerns that a deal may fail to be reached before the deadline.\n\nMr Raab said that he wanted to continue \"accelerating and intensifying\" talks, adding: \"We\u0027re committed to resolving the deal by  and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic a deal is within our reach.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Barnier said a backstop is \"essential to conclude the negotiations\", stating: \"With no backstop there will be no agreement.\"\n\nHe described the issue as a \"matter of some urgency\", adding that he had asked the Brexit Secretary to provide data on how the \"necessary controls and checks take place\".\n\nThe Prime Minister has said she will refuse to contemplate any backstop deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former kincora boys home building on market for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland wont change time zone to suit the eu say unionists","story":"\n Hi

cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

It\u0027s still legal to buy a puppy from a pet shop in the UK. \n\nWe\u0027re delighted that this will be coming to an end, as the UK Government has announced an upcoming ban on third party puppy sales, meaning this unethical trade will stop for good. \npic.twitter/cpjBOEMmib\n\n— The Kennel Club  \nAugust 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe charity said it was particularly concerned about so-called “fashionable” breeds, such as cockerpoos, warning that “bad breeders” would be “only too happy” to fill a gap in the market.\n\nLast month, the Government announced plans to help reduce serious health problems and socialisation issues which afflict pets kept in poor conditions by unscrupulous, profit-driven breeders.\n\nAnyone buying or adopting a pet less than six months old will have to deal directly with the breeder or a rescue centre under the proposed ban.\n\nMs Kisko added: “The government’s plans to ban the third party sale of puppies, through pet shops and the like, is hugely welcome but puppy buyers shouldn’t become complacent.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

US decision to end its funding for a UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees and their descendants is “an attack on the rights of the Palestinian people”, a spokesman for president Mahmoud Abbas has said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nNabil Abu Rudeneh said the move “does not serve peace but rather strengthens terrorism in the region”. \n\nHe said the Palestinian leadership was considering an appeal to the UN Security Council to confront the American stance, which he said was just the latest hostile act of the Trump administration against the Palestinian people, after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved its embassy there. \n\n“This decision, which violates all resolutions of international legitimacy, requires the United Nations to take a firm stand against the US decision and to take appropriate decisions,” he said. \n\n\nThe \n@WhiteHouse\n has decided to “end funding altogether” to \n@UNRWA\n. \n\n526,000 refugee boys\u0027 and girls\u0027 futures are now on the line. \n#FundUNRWA\n because every child has a \n#righttoeducation\n: \nhttps:t.co/XTAilf1ACa\n \n#FundingFridays\n \npic.twitter/uo2yfX20kf\n\n— UNRWA USA  \nAugust 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“Whatever the size of the conspiracies aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause, this will only increase the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and its leadership.”\n\nThe US supplies nearly 30 percent of the total budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, and had been demanding it carry out significant reforms to what it called an “irredeemably flawed operation”. \n\nThe decision cuts nearly 300 million dollars  of planned support.\n\nThe US decision comes as president Donald Trump and his Middle East pointmen, Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, prepare for the rollout of a much-vaunted but as yet unclear peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians, and it could intensify Palestinian suspicions that Washington is using the humanitarian funding as leverage.\n\nUNRWA was established after Israel’s 1948 War of Independence to singularly aid some 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPierre Krahenbuhl, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency speaks at a press conference in Jordan \n\n\n\n\nThe number has since grown to an estimated five million refugees and their descendants, who had an aid agency devoted solely to them while the rest of the world’s refugees depend on the general UNHCR refugee agency.\n\nWhile Palestinian leaders assert the right of those refugees to return to land now under Israeli control, Israel has long argued the agency was politicised and ineffective.\n\nIsrael’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the agency of perpetuating the conflict by helping promote an unrealistic Palestinian demand that refugees have the “right of return” to long-lost homes in what is now Israel. \n\nHe has called for UNRWA to be abolished and its responsibilities taken over by the main UN refugee agency.\n\nSome in Israel have even tougher criticism, accusing UNRWA of teaching hatred of Israel in its classrooms and tolerating or assisting Hamas militants in Gaza.\n\nHamas spokesman Hazem Qassem accused the United States of going after UNRWA to eliminate the Palestinian right to return to their future homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s clear that Trump has shifted from taking sides with the Israeli enemy to being a partner in the assault on our Palestinian peoples’ rights,” he said. “All these decisions will not stop our people’s struggle to gain freedom and return.”\n\nAdnan Abu Hasna, the UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said they currently have 280,000 students in 274 schools and provide food aid to more than one million people.\n\n“Stopping or cutting aid to UNRWA could really affect UNRWA’s operations,” he said. “We don’t think cutting this aid will help stability or pushing the peace process, especially as UNRWA plays a big role in the stability of the region.”\n\nA spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ office released a statement late on Friday regretting the Trump administration’s decision to cut funding, saying the UN has appreciated years of US support for the agency.\n\n“UNRWA has a strong record of providing high-quality education, health and other essential services, often in extremely difficult circumstances, to Palestine refugees who are in great need,” the statement added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"community alert people living woodbrook

They have also failed to engage through the formal negotiating structures with the trade unions.\n\n\u0026ldquoWhile the unions have had positive relations with some management of the legacy councils, it appears that the bad practice approach of others is now predominating.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe trade unions have offered a series of dates for talks with management at the Labour Relations Agency. Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part. We are working closely with all staff to ensure that they are settled in new posts as soon as possible.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Council remains absolutely committed to resolving this issue with the unions, however negotiations must be conducted in good faith and in a spirit of co-operation and transparency.\n\nUNITE\u0026rsquoS regional organiser, David McMurray, told the Recorder yesterday: \u0026ldquoGoing by the mood of the meeting, which unanimously voted for the strike, I see no reason for that to have changed so I\u0026rsquom fairly confident that it will be a successful ballot.\n\nHe frankly admitted that the mood between the two sides had deteriorated.\n\n\u0026ldquoThings have got worse. In fact Mr Hannaway has been disingenuous with his internal statements to the workforce, said Mr McMurray.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some ways I would expect that because if you are going to go to war, why wouldn\u0026rsquot you expect the other side to fight back?\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are waiting for genuine discussions which are open and honest.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
