but she is battling a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that has spread.Last month the newsreader revealed on her blog that a liver enzyme called ALT was rising, ruling her out of further clinical trials.A high level of ALT in the blood is often a sign of liver damage and a warning that a person\u0027s kidneys are also failing.Decreasing appetite, increasing sleep, an irregular heartbeat, dropping blood pressure and  body temperature are also signs that will tell doctors a person\u0027s life is coming to an end.In an Instagram post last month Rachael also said she had stage 4 cancer - meaning the killer disease  has spread to other organs or parts of the body.It also means survival is highly unlikely.Last week, before she was told she had days to live, she said: \u0027At the moment, hope is pinned on things like spending days off supplementary oxygen and getting my increasing liver enzyme numbers down with blood thinners in the hope they’re just caused by a blood clot on my liver\u0027.Rachael has triple negative breast cancer -  a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer often found in younger women.Sufferers will often need chemotherapy, breast surgery and radiotherapy in an attempt to halt its growth and spread.Most breast cancers have receptors on the surface of the cancer cells for the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, and less commonly for a protein called HER2. These receptors can stimulate the cancer to grow - but also mean that they can be treated with hormonal treatments that can slow or stop growth.Triple negative breast cancer don\u0027t have these receptors so this cancer is harder to stop because hormone therapy will not work.Triple negative breast cancer is found in about 1 in 5 women with breast cancer.It occurs more commonly in women under the age of 40 and in black women.A recent study of 50,000 women with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 per cent of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 per cent of women with other types of breast cancer.                                                      Her brave tweet yesterday announcing she has \u0027only got days\u0027 has sparked thousands of responses praising her inspirational dignity and bravery in the face of terminal illness. Yesterday the BBC broadcaster tweeted the news, sparking an outpouring of grief among friends and fans, and today she agreed to publish the plans she has made in the event of her death.She wrote on HuffPost: \u0027I have a Whatsapp group with Steve’s sister where I send her things I want for Freddie and his future. The things that might overwhelm and upset Steve now but she will make sure happens.\u0027Like not cutting his hair too short until he really insists, or my wish for him to go to the very best school and university possible, so long as that’s what he wants.\u0027I’m also planning and wrapping birthday presents which he can open between the ages of four and twenty one.\u0027Personal effects like my notepads – so he can see what my writing was like. Or the perfume he helped pick out for me earlier this year so he’ll remember my smell. And his all-important box of newborn keepsakes\u0027.Rachael is also writing a memoir for her son, called \u0027For Freddie\u0027, and faces a race against time to complete it.She added: \u0027It’s a collection of all those stories your parents tell you over the years from their point of view, mixed in with all the advice they give you.\u0027I’d only known Steve for such a short period of time before we married – I feel there’s so much he needs to know from my point of view and in my voice. And I think I best get my personality down on paper\u0027. Rachael has been documenting her fight against the disease in a blog called Big C Little Me since she was diagnosed in November 2016. The Welsh journalist also hosted a podcast series called You Me \u0026amp The Big C where she discussed the highs and lows of battling the illness.Former BBC colleague Susanna Reid was among those to show their sympathy, writing on Twitter: \u0027Oh Rachael. You have so much courage. \u0027You are loved beyond measure by people you haven\u0027t even met because of the way you have dealt with this. My love to you and your family.\u0027  Writing on Instagram and Twitter yesterday she said: \u0027In the words of the legendary Frank Sinatra, I\u0027m afraid to say the time has come my friends. And suddenly I\u0027m told I\u0027ve only got days, it\u0027s all very surreal.\u0027Colleagues, friends and followers posted online to offer their support and express their sadness. Victoria Derbyshire wrote: \u0027Bloody hell Rachael.

The company instead offered Google\u0027s senior vice president for global affairs and chief legal officer Kent Walker, who lawmakers said was not senior enough to answer their questions.          Senators left an empty chair for Google after the company declined to send an executive the lawmakers deemed senior enough to testify  Testifying: Jack Dorsey and Sherly Sandberg are testifying on election interference and their preparations for the mid-terms with less than two months until voting          Big event: The Senate committee room was packed for the evidence from the Facebook and Twitter leaders          Making his point: Alex Jones of Infowars held an impromptu press conference outside the committee hearing where Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey were being quizzed on Facebook and Twitter\u0027s election security          Banned: Alex Jones of Infowars, who has been kicked off Twitter, was in the audience for the hearing and had interrupted a live CNBC broadcast just beforehandWalker said he will be submitting written testimony to the committee and will  be in Washington to brief lawmakers on Google\u0027s efforts to combat possible foreign influence operations.Trump has upped his criticism of social media firms, accusing them of interfering in both the 2016 and 2018 elections. \u0027I think they already have,\u0027 he told the Daily Caller in an interview published Wednesday. He then switched to 2016, where special counsel Robert Mueller has been probing Russian interference to harm Democrat Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.\u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 Trump said.He continued, without providing any concrete evidence: \u0027Maybe I did a better job because I\u0027m good with the Twitter and I\u0027m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton\u0027s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side,\u0027 Trump said.    The execs are defending their companies against  lawmakers who say they aren\u0027t doing enough combat continuing foreign efforts to influence American politics.Sandberg, who will testify alongside Dorsey, will acknowledge to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and American society, but insist it is doing better.\u0027That\u0027s on us,\u0027 she wrote in prepared testimony released by Facebook. \u0027This interference was completely unacceptable. It violated the values of our company and of the country we love.\u0027 Sandberg says the platform is \u0027now blocking millions of attempts to register false accounts each and every day\u0027 and is \u0027making progress on fake news.\u0027\u0027As these past few weeks and months have shown, this work is starting to pay off.\u0027She said the accounts are taken down if they are foreign or domestic.  Dorsey, who broke with tradition and did not wear a tie to testify, said Twitter is identify 8 to 10 million suspicious accounts every week.  Dorsey, in prepared testimony for a House committee, pushes back on the allegations of bias.  \u0027Let me be clear about one important and foundational fact: Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,\u0027 he plans to say.If Woodward\u0027s book was an \u0027accurate reflection of what is...\u0027I\u0027ll never be a staffer.

In fact, from a simple business perspective and to serve the public conversation, Twitter is incentivized to keep all voices on the platform,\u0027 he will tell the Energy and Commerce Committee.\u0027We\u0027ve removed hundreds of pages and accounts involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior - meaning they misled others about who they were and what they were doing,\u0027 Sandberg said in written testimony released on Tuesday.Warner said questions remain on where the tech companies will go moving forward and that will likely require Congressional action.\u0027Each of you have come a long way with respect to recognizing the threat,\u0027 he said. \u0027The bad news, I\u0027m afraid, is that there is a lot of work still to do. And I\u0027m skeptical that, ultimately, you\u0027ll be able to truly address this challenge on your own. Congress is going to have to take action here.\u0027\u0027The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where we go from here is an open question.\u0027            \u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 President Trump told the Daily Caller, diminishing conclusions of Russian interferenceFacebook, Twitter and other technology firms have been on the defensive for many months over political influence activity on their sites as well as concerns over user privacy.Their executives have traveled to Washington several times to testify in Congress, including 10 hours of questioning of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over two days in April.The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into Russian efforts to influence U.S. public opinion throughout Trump\u0027s presidency, after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that entities backed by the Kremlin had sought to boost his chances of winning the White House in 2016.Moscow denies involvement, and Trump - backed by some of his fellow Republicans in Congress - has repeatedly dismissed investigations of the issue as a partisan witch hunt or hoax.Some Republicans have also charged social media companies with bias against Trump and other conservatives. Twitter\u0027s Dorsey was to follow his Senate testimony on Wednesday morning with an appearance at an afternoon hearing looking at that issue in the House of Representatives.    Here to reassure: Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg are trying to convince senators on the Intelligence Committee that their social networks are ready for the midterms          Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. electionDorsey will tell the House Energy and Commerce Committee that Twitter \u0027does not use political ideology to make any decisions,\u0027 according to written testimony also made public on Tuesday.Trump faulted Twitter on July 26, without citing any evidence, for limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans through a practice known as shadow banning.Last week Trump accused Google\u0027s search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding \u0027fair media\u0027 coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, but the House\u0027s approach to the election issue has been far more partisan than in the Senate.In the Senate, both the Republican Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, and Democratic vice chairman, Mark Warner, said they called Wednesday\u0027s hearing to press the social media companies to do more."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/00/4FB7480A00000578-6134017-Another_competitive_canine_scooping_up_a_world_record_in_Geronim-a-3_1536189878977.jpg","title":"Guinness reveals world record holders 2019 including dog jump six feet","story":"    Feather, a greyhound rescue from Maryland, USA can jump 191.7cm (6ft 3in), which is only a few centimetres less than the British women\u0027s record set by Katrina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Olympics in 2016.  Samantha Valle, 31, Feather\u0027s owner, says her talents became apparent when she saw her jump so high she hit their basement ceiling.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.Another competitive canine scooping up a world record in Geronimo, a border collie - Australian kelpie cross, also rescued by Samantha.Geronimo holds the record for the most double dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, at 128.

However, some private institutions have different fees.Despite tuition fees being high, students are also expected to pay for books, stationary and field trips out of pocket in addition to paying for living costs, which includes accommodation, bills, transport and social events.What student finance is available?Student Finance England offer a tuition fee loan for first-time undergraduates which is paid directly to the university and students will not have to repay until they leave their course.Student Awards Agency Scotland, Student Finance Wales and Student Finance Northern Ireland offer similar funding and a maximum of £9,250 per year can be paid on behalf of the student.      When is the student loan repaid?Students will not have to start repaying their student loan until they are earning over £25,000-a-year, which is referred to as the repayment threshold. This figure applies to England and Wales, while the threshold is £18,330 in Northern Ireland and Scotland.However, for those who started university before 2012, they will have to start repaying after earning over £18,330 a year. Graduates will be required to pay back 9 percent of anything they earn above these amounts every month.So, if you are earning £15,000-a-year, you will not pay anything back while if you are making over £35,000, repayments will be £75 a month. As the money is automatically taken from wages, those who are not self-employed will not have to do anything.If the student loan is not repaid within 30 years, any remaining balance is wiped, but interest could play into graduates wanting to repay their loan early.While interest is set at RPI, currently set at 3.3 percent per year in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is charged on top of the rate of inflation in England and Wales, plus 3 percent every year.How to apply for student financeAccording to Gov.uk, most full-time and part-time students are able to apply for university funding through Student Finance England. Here are the steps to follow:Open an online account on the Student Finance England website and complete the applicationIf you would like the amount you receive to be dependent on household income, add information about your parents and partner.If required, send in proof of identity and any evidence SFE have asked for.While it is recommended to apply as soon as possible, students can still apply for funding nine months after the first day of the academic year for their course. For example, if you are starting between August 1 and December 31, the last day to apply would be May 31.Student finance datesStudents will only receive their funding until after they have registered at their university or college, so in some cases, this may mean that you will have to move in to accommodation and pay rent before the first installment of the money hits your bank account.Payment dates vary from student to student, but Student Finance England aim to provide their customers with their loans during the following months:First payment - September 2018Second payment - January 2018Third payment - April 2019Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

It is simply impossible to move forwards while we remain in the dark like this.\u0027However, we appreciate the work the IOPC are doing to investigate the actions of Dorset Police.\u0027We dearly hope that the extension of these investigations means that the investigation is being given the attention and resources it needs to bring justice for Gaia.\u0027The investigation into the force\u0027s handling of her disappearance was launched earlier this year.           Gaia\u0027s inquest has been delayed due to an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct handling of the case and a previous rape allegation made by GaiaBritish caver is hailed as a \u0027magician\u0027 after convincing...Revealed: Boy, 16, who was arrested over murder of Alesha...Police watchdog launches probe into handling of rape...Share this article    Family and friends of Gaia paid their respects to the teenager at a vigil held in Swanage          An aerial shot of site where police officers found an item of clothing relating to Gaia          Gaia\u0027s disappearance spark a mass search and rescue operation to find her in November 2017  Hundreds of people got involved in the search for Gaia on the Dorset coast (pictured last year)Rosemary Dinch, 71, her son Paul Elsey, 49, and grandson Nathan Elsey, 19, were arrested on suspicion of murder six days into the search, before being released without charge.Gaia\u0027s family said she had been worried that the man she had accused of raping her would be released from prison for an unrelated sex offence at the time of her disappearance.On the day she disappeared, November 7, she was in an agitated state and displaying erratic behaviour. She was last seen alive on CCTV running down a street in Swanage.A huge search for Gaia was carried out and a member of the public found clothing belonging to the teenager in a cliff-top field on November 16.Her partially-clothed body was discovered nearby two days.The IOPC began an investigation into police\u0027s handling of the case back in April. It then launched a second investigation in July into the handling of the rape allegation Gaia made in December 2015 following a request from the family.An IOPC spokesman said: \u0027Coroners often adjourn inquests to await the outcome of our independent investigations as the evidence gathered may assist their decision-making.\u0027We have two investigations ongoing which we will work to complete as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.\u0027    Gaia\u0027s family and friends insist she was distraught in the days leading up to her death because a man she claimed raped her was soon to be released from prison. Two days before going missing, she posted a screenshot of texts she had sent on Instagram, which read: \u0027Police are into my phone I think. I\u0027m gonna have to put it down til Wednesday... Or I\u0027ll get a real shutup and be put in a cell myself.\u0027She captioned the post with the hashtag: \u0027#sexualassault\u0027. The alleged perpetrator of the attack had been jailed for an unrelated offence, but Gaia feared he could shortly be released, adding to the anxiety caused by her severe epilepsy.          Gaia is pictured on CCTV footage from a petrol station before she disappeared in November Speaking previously her father Richard Sutherland said: \u0027She was involved in a situation where some guys sexually assaulted her.  \u0027This had a really devastating effect on her. I think this had been coming back into her head. She was scared\u0027.Her mother, Natasha Pope, said: \u0027There is no doubt in my mind: this is what drove Gaia up the hill that night. \u0027I am relieved that, at last, it will be properly investigated and I am resolved to see positive change.\u0027It was not her intention but, in a way, my daughter gave her life to shine a light on all this.\u0027  In February, the opening of Gaia\u0027s inquest heard that she died from hypothermia, and Dorset Coroner Rachael Griffin ordered statements from various organisations, including Dorset social services, Dorset Police, the local hospital trust and her GP.             "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4F7F06EB00000578-0-Emotional_Kim_broke_down_in_tears_as_she_accused_Coleen_of_makin-a-16_1536152559883.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER unfortunate minutes TV turned witch hunt","story":"    Emotional: Kim broke down in tears as she accused Coleen of making her life \u0027hell\u0027 and bullying her during their time in the CBB houseJANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...How Lynda Bellingham begged her husband to marry again:...Share this articleThe abuse that Coleen has endured has shocked even me - someone who can give as good as she gets. Coleen’s crime - if you can describe it as that - was to appear on Loose Women a week ago alongside her nemesis from Celebrity Big Brother, Kim Woodburn, to try and settle their differences. I reluctantly agreed to mediate - and, (unwisely, in retrospect) - agreed to emulate Judge Rinder and put on a black robe.It was supposed to be a light-hearted bit of fun, and Kim was happy to come on the show, for which she received a decent fee. To put the record straight, Kim Woodburn and I have never fallen out - she’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and (like me) she isn’t afraid to speak her mind. During her last appearance on Loose Women, we got on fine.          Two-faced: Things had escalated on the show, as the pair discussed their past together, with Coleen admitting: \u0027I think Kim\u0027s right I was two-faced with Kim in the house,\u0027This time, however, the chat got off to a rocky start, with Kim immediately accusing the totally innocent Linda Robson of siding with Coleen. What followed, was unreal - in all my 40 years of television, I’ve never encountered someone like Kim who defies all reason, who started ranting, convinced she was being attacked, and would not draw breath. I could do little to stem the tirade - if you watch the show that’s obvious. I’m hardly colluding in verbal abuse. Kim eventually stormed off after deciding to introduce her troubled childhood into the discussion. Coleen (who also, by the way, had an extremely difficult childhood) barely said a word.          Shocking: Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan proved their feud was still going strong as they had an almighty row during Wednesday\u0027s episode of Loose WomenAfterwards, we sat in a meeting room in total shock. The breakdown in communication between the presenters and our guest was bad enough - but what followed on social media was truly insane, and didn’t reflect (in my opinion) what actually happened. Coleen has been accused of being a bully, of gloating (and worse). She’s received death threats and has been trolled by small minded idiots who say they hope she dies of cancer like her sister Bernie. Even more bizarre, a petition has been launched to try and get Coleen sacked from Loose Women, signed by thousands who haven’t even watched the interview.I’ve been told I am a bully and that my reputation is in tatters, and slagged off by high minded newspapers like the Guardian - who seem desperate to join in the storm. The effect on Coleen has been devastating - a day afterwards, she texted me to say she’d been crying non-stop. Yesterday she appeared on ITV’s This Morning, still barely able to talk through the tears.  Shocked: The pensioner went on to accuse the audience of \u0027laughing\u0027 at her, as she spat: \u0027Look you folks can laugh all you want. I\u0027m going to tell you something now and then I\u0027m going to leave\u0027As Coleen has said, this storm is truly shocking - and hard to understand. She (and all the Loose Women) have fronted well-received campaigns to highlight mental health and body confidence, and the show won Best Entertainment show at the Mind Media Awards. Last year, Coleen, Linda and I stripped off for a billboard campaign to persuade other women that whatever shape you are, it’s OK. When I joined Loose Women seven years ago, Coleen was a friendly face. It was a challenging experience, a bit like starting at a new school. Trying to find a way to fit into a gang of old mates, who had been around for ages wasn’t easy. Coleen extended me a warm welcome and was always supportive.To see her go through the recent breakdown of her marriage, and still go on screen being a strong woman who is there for other women, has been inspiring. She represents everything I am very bad at - close family relationships and empathy, laced with a strong dose of down to earth common sense and life experience.          TRASH! Shaking her finger at Coleen, Kim then angrily shouted out \u0027She is trash\u0027, as she stormed out the studio, ignoring Janet Street-Porter call out \u0027She\u0027s not trash\u0027Coleen and Kim have never seen eye to eye - but Coleen is not a spiteful or revengeful person, all of which makes her current predicament so incomprehensible. A woman who has publicly talked about her grief over the death of one sister and is coping with the serious health issues faced by another is hardly unsympathetic. A woman who has talked candidly about a violent father who sexually abused her sister Anne. Coleen understands the tough side of life - and, at the age of 53 - has decided to go back on tour - alone. She says she wants to ‘take control’ of her life, to reassess things, now that she’s a single woman again.To put the record straight, Coleen Nolan is not a bully - and neither am I. I’m proud she’s my friend, and shame on those people who want to hurt her. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/12/4F79974200000578-0-image-m-4_1535974590327.jpg","title":"UK French talks prevent scallop clashes","story":"Share this articleScallop wars: Breakthrough after UK and France talks"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4FA7F89800000578-0-image-m-77_1536153867998.jpg","title":"Indonesian Sharia law district bans men women dining unless married related","story":"    Young Acehnese people sit at a restaurant in Bireun, a district in Indonesia\u0027s easternmost province Aceh, where from today restaurants are not supposed to serve women unless they are accompanied by their husband or a relative          A Muslim woman gets caned with 23 strokes after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda Aceh in October 2016          Indonesia\u0027s deeply Islamic Aceh province has banned men and women from dining together unless they are married or relatedUnder the latest Islamic regulation, women in Bireuen district on Sumatra island will not be able to share a table with men at restaurants and coffee shops unless they are accompanied by their husband or a close male relative.Co-workers on their lunch break would also be forbidden from sharing a meal.Jufliwan, the head of the local sharia agency, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told AFP today: \u0027The objective is to protect women\u0027s dignity so they will feel more comfortable, more at ease, more well-behaved and will not do anything that violates sharia (Islamic law).\u0027Another part of the directive - signed by the district head last month - said women who were alone or not with family should not be served at restaurants and cafés after 9:00 pm.\u0027Kristen was half in the pool, face down\u0027: Dad of Australian...British woman, 29, is found dead in a swimming pool on dream...Australian teenage girl drowns after falling into a pool and...Dele Alli is accused of being an agent of Satanist...Share this article    Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside of marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant          Crowds watch and film the punishment on their mobile phones outside a mosque in Banda Aceh, IndonesiaAuthorities say it will be up to restaurateurs to enforce the regulation, although offenders will not be punished.Three years ago provincial capital Banda Aceh banned unaccompanied women from entertainment venues like cafes and sports halls after 11:00 pm.In 2013, Lhokseumawe city in Sumatra\u0027s north ordered women to sit \u0027side-saddle\u0027 on motorbikes with their legs dangling off to one side.The mayor at the time said straddling male drivers on motorbikes was \u0027improper\u0027.In 2016 a Muslim woman was caned 23 times after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda, Aceh. Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant.

Their mission was a success and after the British agreed to talks with the Sardar, they agreed to roll back the tax rates.Patel was also a sanitation commissioner in the city of Ahmedabad from 1917 and was later elected Ahmedabad’s Municipal President in 1922, 1924 and 1927, during a time in which there was an extension of electricity supply and major educational reforms.Following this, Vallabhbhai rose to the Indian National Congress and was at the helm of various rebel events before organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937, as well as promoting the Quit India movement.As India’s first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he was also responsible for organising relief in Punjab and Delhi while restoring peace throughout the country. Patel was one of the early promoters of property rights and free enterprise in India.However, while his leadership was multifaceted, Vallabhbhai’s pivotal role was to practice what was referred to Suraaj, which means good governance and always encouraged unity, having mobilised the farmers and bringing together various castes to join the struggle for freedom.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in courtBefore he became involved in the struggle for freedom, Vallabhbhai Patel was a lawyer with dreams of becoming a barrister, but in those days, in order to achieve this, one had to travel to England and having been born to a farmer, he did not have the financial means to even attend university.However, Patel taught himself after borrowing books from a friend who was a lawyer and started attending court sessions, learning from just observing the arguments that were made. He passed his exams with flying colours and opened a practice in Godhra.His selfless character shone through when although he had the financial means to send himself to England, he let his older brother Vitthalbhai, who was also a lawyer, pursue higher education in Law first before he left for England himself.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statueSardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be memorialised with a statue that will remind India of its struggle for freedom and also, inspire the people of the country to share his ideologies of unity, patriotism, growth and governance.Already being built on Sadhu Island in the state of Gujarat with the Narmada river around it, the Statue of Unity will be 597 feet tall and will be twice the size of the Statue of Liberty and 100 feet higher than China’s Spring Temple Buddha.The Statue of Unity will have a viewing gallery at 501 feet in addition to a visitor’s centre, offering expansive views of the surrounding area. There will also be a three-star 128-room hotel with a restaurant and conference facilities.Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

The couple have two children together, John and Kristine. Jon Kyl and Donald TrumpKyl has a complex view of U.S. President Donald Trump, criticizing him in the past but also receiving praise from him as of late.In a February 2018 interview with the Phoenix radio station KJZZ, Kyl expressed criticism at the President’s ‘boorish’ style and believed he could be a more effective leader if he acted ‘more diplomatic.’‘I don’t like his style. Much of it is boorish. I think he’s his own worst enemy,’ Kyl said.      Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

The company’s beverage can now be made with almond and coconut milk instead of cow milk, and its baristas claim the change doesn’t alter the taste.

Mail critic QUENTIN LETTS casts a sardonic eye over last night\u0027s Love Island finale after the ITV2 reality show gripped millions ‘We were right to say in March that the Russian state was responsible,’ said Mrs May.‘Now we can go further. The Government has concluded that the two iniduals named by the police are officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU.’This earned gasps from the House. Or at least most sides of it. Jeremy Corbyn and his neighbour Emily Thornberry slanted their heads with expressions of sour ennui. Mr Corbyn’s response to Mrs May was a classless piece of work: grudging, equivocal, snippy, approaching only the minimum of decency.He conceded the attack was ‘an outrage’ and that there had been ‘a superhuman police effort’ but he wanted to know what steps Mrs May and Co were taking to secure the Kremlin’s co-operation in bringing the suspects to trial.Conservative MPs gave him the bird for this. ‘Get real!’ shouted one. It did sound as if the Labour leader still did not comprehend the Russian state’s likely complicity in the attack. Mr Corbyn bridled. ‘This is a serious matter,’ he said, his rising voice petulant.Tory MPs: ‘Yes it is!’Miss Thornberry shook her head to show she disapproved of and put herself morally above the Tories’ molten anger. Later Mr Corbyn suffered a slip of the tongue when he said he wanted to ‘condemn’ the police. He swiftly corrected this to ‘commend’ but it was an eye-rolling moment. Boris Johnson (Con, Uxbridge \u0026amp S Ruislip) was the first backbencher to be given the floor. He deplored Mr Corbyn’s ‘somewhat weaselly language’.Later Corbyn critic Chris Leslie (Lab, Nottingham E) urged Mrs May to ‘ignore the cranks and the ideological extremists’ who sided with Russia to ‘sow mistrust in our security professionals’.Richard Benyon (Con, Newbury) spoke of the Kremlin having ‘fellow travellers and useful idiots’ in the West. Several Labour MPs had chosen to stay away from the Chamber, perhaps not wishing to have to endure another of Mr Corbyn’s unpatriotic performances on the Salisbury attack. Towards the end, even his frontbench was pretty empty.Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP, found a more certain tone of gravity than his Labour counterpart. Dominic Grieve (Con, Beaconsfield) described the Russian state as ‘a gangster organisation’ and hoped we would make it harder for Russians to enter our country.‘We must unreservedly condemn Russia,’ said Yvette Cooper (Lab, Normanton) – something Mr Corbyn had omitted to do.Chris Bryant had ‘no doubt’ Vladimir Putin ‘himself personally’ was at the end of the bloody trail.

And that is not just about leave or remain but also the other big Brexit debate – what future we want as a country post-Brexit,’ the minister said.           Some university groups have allowed controversial guests to be trolled and even verbally abused or banned from attending booked speechesDetroit public schools turn off water at 106 public schools...Woman, 20, is shot in stomach in south-east London as...Former Greens boss is accused of calling women \u0027power...Share this article‘These will be big impassioned debates in Parliament and in the country.

They bring universities and their towns much-needed money, but vice chancellors fear they are being put off because of rules which prevent them working in the UK after their degrees.

Senators left an empty chair for Google after the company declined to send an executive the lawmakers deemed senior enough to testify  Testifying: Jack Dorsey and Sherly Sandberg are testifying on election interference and their preparations for the mid-terms with less than two months until voting          Big event: The Senate committee room was packed for the evidence from the Facebook and Twitter leaders          Making his point: Alex Jones of Infowars held an impromptu press conference outside the committee hearing where Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey were being quizzed on Facebook and Twitter\u0027s election security          Banned: Alex Jones of Infowars, who has been kicked off Twitter, was in the audience for the hearing and had interrupted a live CNBC broadcast just beforehandWalker said he will be submitting written testimony to the committee and will  be in Washington to brief lawmakers on Google\u0027s efforts to combat possible foreign influence operations.Trump has upped his criticism of social media firms, accusing them of interfering in both the 2016 and 2018 elections. \u0027I think they already have,\u0027 he told the Daily Caller in an interview published Wednesday. He then switched to 2016, where special counsel Robert Mueller has been probing Russian interference to harm Democrat Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.\u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 Trump said.He continued, without providing any concrete evidence: \u0027Maybe I did a better job because I\u0027m good with the Twitter and I\u0027m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton\u0027s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side,\u0027 Trump said.    The execs are defending their companies against  lawmakers who say they aren\u0027t doing enough combat continuing foreign efforts to influence American politics.Sandberg, who will testify alongside Dorsey, will acknowledge to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and American society, but insist it is doing better.\u0027That\u0027s on us,\u0027 she wrote in prepared testimony released by Facebook. \u0027This interference was completely unacceptable. It violated the values of our company and of the country we love.\u0027 Sandberg says the platform is \u0027now blocking millions of attempts to register false accounts each and every day\u0027 and is \u0027making progress on fake news.\u0027\u0027As these past few weeks and months have shown, this work is starting to pay off.\u0027She said the accounts are taken down if they are foreign or domestic.  Dorsey, who broke with tradition and did not wear a tie to testify, said Twitter is identify 8 to 10 million suspicious accounts every week.  Dorsey, in prepared testimony for a House committee, pushes back on the allegations of bias.  \u0027Let me be clear about one important and foundational fact: Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,\u0027 he plans to say.If Woodward\u0027s book was an \u0027accurate reflection of what is...\u0027I\u0027ll never be a staffer. I\u0027m the First Daughter!\u0027 Bob...Huge upset in Massachusetts Democrat primary as Ayanna...Trump says an assassination attempt on Syrian dictator...Share this article\u0027We believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially. We do not shadowban anyone based on political ideology. In fact, from a simple business perspective and to serve the public conversation, Twitter is incentivized to keep all voices on the platform,\u0027 he will tell the Energy and Commerce Committee.\u0027We\u0027ve removed hundreds of pages and accounts involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior - meaning they misled others about who they were and what they were doing,\u0027 Sandberg said in written testimony released on Tuesday.Warner said questions remain on where the tech companies will go moving forward and that will likely require Congressional action.\u0027Each of you have come a long way with respect to recognizing the threat,\u0027 he said. \u0027The bad news, I\u0027m afraid, is that there is a lot of work still to do. And I\u0027m skeptical that, ultimately, you\u0027ll be able to truly address this challenge on your own. Congress is going to have to take action here.\u0027\u0027The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where we go from here is an open question.\u0027            \u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 President Trump told the Daily Caller, diminishing conclusions of Russian interferenceFacebook, Twitter and other technology firms have been on the defensive for many months over political influence activity on their sites as well as concerns over user privacy.Their executives have traveled to Washington several times to testify in Congress, including 10 hours of questioning of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over two days in April.The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into Russian efforts to influence U.S. public opinion throughout Trump\u0027s presidency, after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that entities backed by the Kremlin had sought to boost his chances of winning the White House in 2016.Moscow denies involvement, and Trump - backed by some of his fellow Republicans in Congress - has repeatedly dismissed investigations of the issue as a partisan witch hunt or hoax.Some Republicans have also charged social media companies with bias against Trump and other conservatives. Twitter\u0027s Dorsey was to follow his Senate testimony on Wednesday morning with an appearance at an afternoon hearing looking at that issue in the House of Representatives.    Here to reassure: Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg are trying to convince senators on the Intelligence Committee that their social networks are ready for the midterms          Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. electionDorsey will tell the House Energy and Commerce Committee that Twitter \u0027does not use political ideology to make any decisions,\u0027 according to written testimony also made public on Tuesday.Trump faulted Twitter on July 26, without citing any evidence, for limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans through a practice known as shadow banning.Last week Trump accused Google\u0027s search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding \u0027fair media\u0027 coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, but the House\u0027s approach to the election issue has been far more partisan than in the Senate.In the Senate, both the Republican Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, and Democratic vice chairman, Mark Warner, said they called Wednesday\u0027s hearing to press the social media companies to do more."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/00/4FB7480A00000578-6134017-Another_competitive_canine_scooping_up_a_world_record_in_Geronim-a-3_1536189878977.jpg","title":"Guinness reveals world record holders 2019 including dog jump six feet","story":"    Feather, a greyhound rescue from Maryland, USA can jump 191.7cm (6ft 3in), which is only a few centimetres less than the British women\u0027s record set by Katrina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Olympics in 2016.  Samantha Valle, 31, Feather\u0027s owner, says her talents became apparent when she saw her jump so high she hit their basement ceiling.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.Another competitive canine scooping up a world record in Geronimo, a border collie - Australian kelpie cross, also rescued by Samantha.Geronimo holds the record for the most double dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, at 128.

Nor has any significant information been disclosed to us about what happened to Gaia and why.\u0027Without answers, we live in limbo. It is simply impossible to move forwards while we remain in the dark like this.\u0027However, we appreciate the work the IOPC are doing to investigate the actions of Dorset Police.\u0027We dearly hope that the extension of these investigations means that the investigation is being given the attention and resources it needs to bring justice for Gaia.\u0027The investigation into the force\u0027s handling of her disappearance was launched earlier this year.           Gaia\u0027s inquest has been delayed due to an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct handling of the case and a previous rape allegation made by GaiaBritish caver is hailed as a \u0027magician\u0027 after convincing...Revealed: Boy, 16, who was arrested over murder of Alesha...Police watchdog launches probe into handling of rape...Share this article    Family and friends of Gaia paid their respects to the teenager at a vigil held in Swanage          An aerial shot of site where police officers found an item of clothing relating to Gaia          Gaia\u0027s disappearance spark a mass search and rescue operation to find her in November 2017  Hundreds of people got involved in the search for Gaia on the Dorset coast (pictured last year)Rosemary Dinch, 71, her son Paul Elsey, 49, and grandson Nathan Elsey, 19, were arrested on suspicion of murder six days into the search, before being released without charge.Gaia\u0027s family said she had been worried that the man she had accused of raping her would be released from prison for an unrelated sex offence at the time of her disappearance.On the day she disappeared, November 7, she was in an agitated state and displaying erratic behaviour. She was last seen alive on CCTV running down a street in Swanage.A huge search for Gaia was carried out and a member of the public found clothing belonging to the teenager in a cliff-top field on November 16.Her partially-clothed body was discovered nearby two days.The IOPC began an investigation into police\u0027s handling of the case back in April. It then launched a second investigation in July into the handling of the rape allegation Gaia made in December 2015 following a request from the family.An IOPC spokesman said: \u0027Coroners often adjourn inquests to await the outcome of our independent investigations as the evidence gathered may assist their decision-making.\u0027We have two investigations ongoing which we will work to complete as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.\u0027    Gaia\u0027s family and friends insist she was distraught in the days leading up to her death because a man she claimed raped her was soon to be released from prison. Two days before going missing, she posted a screenshot of texts she had sent on Instagram, which read: \u0027Police are into my phone I think. I\u0027m gonna have to put it down til Wednesday... Or I\u0027ll get a real shutup and be put in a cell myself.\u0027She captioned the post with the hashtag: \u0027#sexualassault\u0027. The alleged perpetrator of the attack had been jailed for an unrelated offence, but Gaia feared he could shortly be released, adding to the anxiety caused by her severe epilepsy.          Gaia is pictured on CCTV footage from a petrol station before she disappeared in November Speaking previously her father Richard Sutherland said: \u0027She was involved in a situation where some guys sexually assaulted her.  \u0027This had a really devastating effect on her. I think this had been coming back into her head. She was scared\u0027.Her mother, Natasha Pope, said: \u0027There is no doubt in my mind: this is what drove Gaia up the hill that night. \u0027I am relieved that, at last, it will be properly investigated and I am resolved to see positive change.\u0027It was not her intention but, in a way, my daughter gave her life to shine a light on all this.\u0027  In February, the opening of Gaia\u0027s inquest heard that she died from hypothermia, and Dorset Coroner Rachael Griffin ordered statements from various organisations, including Dorset social services, Dorset Police, the local hospital trust and her GP.             "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4F7F06EB00000578-0-Emotional_Kim_broke_down_in_tears_as_she_accused_Coleen_of_makin-a-16_1536152559883.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER unfortunate minutes TV turned witch hunt","story":"    Emotional: Kim broke down in tears as she accused Coleen of making her life \u0027hell\u0027 and bullying her during their time in the CBB houseJANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...How Lynda Bellingham begged her husband to marry again:...Share this articleThe abuse that Coleen has endured has shocked even me - someone who can give as good as she gets. Coleen’s crime - if you can describe it as that - was to appear on Loose Women a week ago alongside her nemesis from Celebrity Big Brother, Kim Woodburn, to try and settle their differences. I reluctantly agreed to mediate - and, (unwisely, in retrospect) - agreed to emulate Judge Rinder and put on a black robe.It was supposed to be a light-hearted bit of fun, and Kim was happy to come on the show, for which she received a decent fee. To put the record straight, Kim Woodburn and I have never fallen out - she’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and (like me) she isn’t afraid to speak her mind. During her last appearance on Loose Women, we got on fine.          Two-faced: Things had escalated on the show, as the pair discussed their past together, with Coleen admitting: \u0027I think Kim\u0027s right I was two-faced with Kim in the house,\u0027This time, however, the chat got off to a rocky start, with Kim immediately accusing the totally innocent Linda Robson of siding with Coleen. What followed, was unreal - in all my 40 years of television, I’ve never encountered someone like Kim who defies all reason, who started ranting, convinced she was being attacked, and would not draw breath. I could do little to stem the tirade - if you watch the show that’s obvious. I’m hardly colluding in verbal abuse. Kim eventually stormed off after deciding to introduce her troubled childhood into the discussion. Coleen (who also, by the way, had an extremely difficult childhood) barely said a word.          Shocking: Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan proved their feud was still going strong as they had an almighty row during Wednesday\u0027s episode of Loose WomenAfterwards, we sat in a meeting room in total shock. The breakdown in communication between the presenters and our guest was bad enough - but what followed on social media was truly insane, and didn’t reflect (in my opinion) what actually happened. Coleen has been accused of being a bully, of gloating (and worse). She’s received death threats and has been trolled by small minded idiots who say they hope she dies of cancer like her sister Bernie. Even more bizarre, a petition has been launched to try and get Coleen sacked from Loose Women, signed by thousands who haven’t even watched the interview.I’ve been told I am a bully and that my reputation is in tatters, and slagged off by high minded newspapers like the Guardian - who seem desperate to join in the storm. The effect on Coleen has been devastating - a day afterwards, she texted me to say she’d been crying non-stop. Yesterday she appeared on ITV’s This Morning, still barely able to talk through the tears.  Shocked: The pensioner went on to accuse the audience of \u0027laughing\u0027 at her, as she spat: \u0027Look you folks can laugh all you want. I\u0027m going to tell you something now and then I\u0027m going to leave\u0027As Coleen has said, this storm is truly shocking - and hard to understand. She (and all the Loose Women) have fronted well-received campaigns to highlight mental health and body confidence, and the show won Best Entertainment show at the Mind Media Awards. Last year, Coleen, Linda and I stripped off for a billboard campaign to persuade other women that whatever shape you are, it’s OK. When I joined Loose Women seven years ago, Coleen was a friendly face. It was a challenging experience, a bit like starting at a new school. Trying to find a way to fit into a gang of old mates, who had been around for ages wasn’t easy. Coleen extended me a warm welcome and was always supportive.To see her go through the recent breakdown of her marriage, and still go on screen being a strong woman who is there for other women, has been inspiring. She represents everything I am very bad at - close family relationships and empathy, laced with a strong dose of down to earth common sense and life experience.          TRASH! Shaking her finger at Coleen, Kim then angrily shouted out \u0027She is trash\u0027, as she stormed out the studio, ignoring Janet Street-Porter call out \u0027She\u0027s not trash\u0027Coleen and Kim have never seen eye to eye - but Coleen is not a spiteful or revengeful person, all of which makes her current predicament so incomprehensible. A woman who has publicly talked about her grief over the death of one sister and is coping with the serious health issues faced by another is hardly unsympathetic. A woman who has talked candidly about a violent father who sexually abused her sister Anne. Coleen understands the tough side of life - and, at the age of 53 - has decided to go back on tour - alone. She says she wants to ‘take control’ of her life, to reassess things, now that she’s a single woman again.To put the record straight, Coleen Nolan is not a bully - and neither am I. I’m proud she’s my friend, and shame on those people who want to hurt her. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4FA7F89800000578-0-image-m-77_1536153867998.jpg","title":"Indonesian Sharia law district bans men women dining unless married related","story":"    Young Acehnese people sit at a restaurant in Bireun, a district in Indonesia\u0027s easternmost province Aceh, where from today restaurants are not supposed to serve women unless they are accompanied by their husband or a relative          A Muslim woman gets caned with 23 strokes after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda Aceh in October 2016          Indonesia\u0027s deeply Islamic Aceh province has banned men and women from dining together unless they are married or relatedUnder the latest Islamic regulation, women in Bireuen district on Sumatra island will not be able to share a table with men at restaurants and coffee shops unless they are accompanied by their husband or a close male relative.Co-workers on their lunch break would also be forbidden from sharing a meal.Jufliwan, the head of the local sharia agency, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told AFP today: \u0027The objective is to protect women\u0027s dignity so they will feel more comfortable, more at ease, more well-behaved and will not do anything that violates sharia (Islamic law).\u0027Another part of the directive - signed by the district head last month - said women who were alone or not with family should not be served at restaurants and cafés after 9:00 pm.\u0027Kristen was half in the pool, face down\u0027: Dad of Australian...British woman, 29, is found dead in a swimming pool on dream...Australian teenage girl drowns after falling into a pool and...Dele Alli is accused of being an agent of Satanist...Share this article    Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside of marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant          Crowds watch and film the punishment on their mobile phones outside a mosque in Banda Aceh, IndonesiaAuthorities say it will be up to restaurateurs to enforce the regulation, although offenders will not be punished.Three years ago provincial capital Banda Aceh banned unaccompanied women from entertainment venues like cafes and sports halls after 11:00 pm.In 2013, Lhokseumawe city in Sumatra\u0027s north ordered women to sit \u0027side-saddle\u0027 on motorbikes with their legs dangling off to one side.The mayor at the time said straddling male drivers on motorbikes was \u0027improper\u0027.In 2016 a Muslim woman was caned 23 times after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda, Aceh. Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant.

But when it becomes an excuse to foist bad architecture on to struggling communities in the cynical pursuit of an ‘anything is better than what was there before’ methodology, it simply recycles the resentment regeneration was supposed to redress,” the judges said.The original nominator of the building lambasted it as “one of the most horrendous architectural responses ever conceived for Greater Manchester”.Other buildings that made the shortlist included an extension of the Shankly hotel in Liverpool, which was judged to be out of keeping with the original historic building, and London’s “bland” and “boxy” Lewisham Gateway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/651ff304a51914ca990f88b06522efe72fa9ae21/0_799_4140_2483/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2b68a43e1c68c3ef6ef621c3e611ab","title":"toby amies best photograph south 8th street new york 911","story":"‘This is a photograph of an atrocity – and I’m still slightly appalled that my response was to take a picture of it’When 911 happened, I’d been living on South 8th Street in Williamsburg, New York, for about a year. To the right, you can see a pale awning – that was my studio, a windowless shed. My apartment was the top flat in that three-storey red building further down.I don’t remember the exact time I took this, though you could work it out from the state of the towers. I remember I had got up late – I’d been DJing the night before – and I needed to go to the bank, which was a block away. As I opened the door, it was such a beautiful day with an extraordinary crisp light and beautiful colours, that I thought: “Ooh, I’ll take my camera.” I went back inside and grabbed the ancient Zeiss Ikon that my grandmother had got in a swap for cigarettes during the Berlin airlift.When I came out of the bank, a quarter of an hourlater, I turned on to South 8th Street and noticed a group of Hasidic Jews and Puerto Ricans staring down the street. You don’t normally see those two groups together, so I took a photograph. I then walked to the corner to see what they were looking at and saw the towers smoking. I took another picture, then this one.I use a camera to help me make sense of reality. But photography can also distance you from something. This is a photograph of an atrocity, and I’m still slightly appalled that my response was to take a picture of it. But I recognise that there was nothing I could have done at this point. The attack was such an enormous tear in normality, it was almost impossible to process. As a photographer, I’m proud I was processing the aesthetics of it but as a human being, I’m ashamed.I went straight home and woke my girlfriend up. She loved New York City. One of the reasons we’d rented our apartment was its extraordinary view of downtown. I remember holding her and experiencing it all through her sense of something she adored being under attack. We saw both buildings collapse through our bedroom window. My landlord Simon, who was Hasidic, came to the flat to watch TV. I don’t think he had access to one elsewhere. I imagine that the Hasidic women in the photograph didn’t either.There’s a game we used to play in big cities as children. You would stand on a corner staring up and see how many people you could get to do the same. Here, it was this terrible thing that everyone was glued to. And because of the grid system of the city, everyone was staring down exactly the same line. Today, everyone would have their phones out.The street itself physically draws a line between inidual experiences of 911 and the people who lost their lives in the twin towers. So many things that happened to me on that street were important, but in the context of what occurred at the end of it, my personal experience feels trivial. I had walked out of my studio with a sense of freedom, an “I can do whatever I want today, I’m an artist” type of feeling.

The result is a spatial spectacular – with a whopping 35 performance hotspotsAt Battersea Arts Centre it can be hard to tell where the audience stops and the acting begins. The rambling Victorian town hall in south London, home to experimental theatre since the 1970s, has long revelled in blurring the boundaries of stage and seat, mingling performers with guests and presenting plays on landings, in the bar and even in its offices. BAC has finally completed a 12-year, £13.3m restoration project by celebrated theatre architects Haworth Tompkins – and it’s just as hard to tell where the original building ends and the new bits begin.“We call it scratch architecture,” says architect Steve Tompkins, referring to the process of scratch theatre pioneered at BAC, where ideas are tested out live in the early stages of development, with audience feedback used to evolve the performance. “It’s not about a perfectly authored finished product, which is a difficult idea for architects to stomach,” he adds. “But we wondered if we could do a parallel process by insinuating ourselves into the productions. What would it mean for us to relinquish tyrannical control over the project?”The answer is the creation of a magical place that surprises at every turn. In a phased process of keyhole surgery, the firm has opened up new routes through the building, carved out new performing spaces, inserted office accommodation and actors’ bedrooms, and raised the number of rooms and areas in which to stage performances from four to 35. Just as all this was reaching completion in 2015, BAC’s grand hall burned to the ground, leaving only two gable walls standing. But the fire-charred relic provided an additional opportunity: the hall has been carefully resurrected and added to, creating one of London’s most spectacular interiors.The unusual nature of the process makes more sense when you meet David Jubb, BAC’s energetic artistic director since 2004. “I’d never done a capital project before,” he says, describing his alarm at inheriting his predecessor’s comprehensive £30m masterplan for the building. “I visited a lot of other recent theatre projects and all the artistic directors had this haunted expression in their eyes, as if they’d been scarred by the process. It seems that there’s a general idea that a building is ‘done to you’, and you can’t change it.”Not a pair for following conventions, Jubb and Tompkins tore up the plans and embarked on a collaborative investigation of the building, looking for opportunities and testing out ideas. The seminal production of The Masque of the Red Death in 2007, by the immersive theatre company Punchdrunk, was a game-changer, infiltrating more parts of the complex than most people knew existed. The company opened up the building’s 16 chimneys, tore down partitions and created new connections in a process that has continued over the years and been progressively formalised. Every part of the building is now kitted out with ceiling hanging points and electrical outlets, so any space can be converted into a theatre in a couple of hours.Some of the most successful interventions are the cheapest: a line of high-backed restaurant-style bench seats and tables now climb up the ceremonial stairs in the main entrance, draped with folded stair carpet, as if the staircase grew bored with being steps and rose up to become dining booths. It is a brilliant moment of multi-levelled social theatre to be greeted with, matched only by the chaos of the new creche, where kids tumble across Teletubby mounds.Similar spatial drama is found in an old courtyard in the centre of the building, previously cluttered with lean-to structures and dead pigeons. It has been converted into a compact outdoor theatre, with vertical steel gantries and removable seating, its proportions giving the feel of a bear-pit. With layers of spectators peering down from stacks of balconies, and even from a deck on the roof, it has the vertiginous intensity of a Shakespearean theatre. The new walls have been finished in white glazed brick, framing the original red-brick building like an archaeological imprint, the facades studded with windows where performers might appear at any minute, while a raised floor allows for more trap-door surprises.One wing of the attic, meanwhile, has been converted into light and airy office accommodation for BAC’s 65 staff, who seem relieved to finally have a permanent home where they won’t be displaced by itinerant performances (or not yet). Along the other wing, the architects have inserted eight twin bedrooms, a boon given that rent is one of the biggest barriers to staging work in London. The basement has also been transformed into the Scratch Hub, a place to incubate start-up business from the surrounding area, continuing the strong outreach programme with nearby council estates, a big part of Jubb’s inclusive agenda over the past decade.“This is not a place to come and experience the future of theatre,” he says. “It is for people to come and show us what the future of theatre might be. It’s about enabling people to shape it for themselves.” His vision is in keeping with the radical history of the building, a focal point for the trade union movement, the women’s suffrage campaign and the election of the first black mayor of a London borough – Battersea – in 1913. “It has always been a place where new ideas have been made.”The sense of permissiveness and possibility is embodied in Haworth Tompkins’s approach. Details such as the new signage perched on a giant steel I-beam, or the exposed scarring in the wall, where an artist has highlighted the marks left by chasing the electrical wiring into the plaster, say that this is a building in flux even after the architects have left.The climax of old and new comes in the restored grand hall, beginning with a prelude in the atmospheric corridors at the back of the building, where layers of scorched plaster and mosaic flooring have the air of something from Pompeii. They are illuminated by rows of cast silicone light fittings, which look like hand-blown gas lamps, but will survive being walloped by a ladder, while sturdy oak doors lead into the hall.Where a barrel-vaulted ceiling encrusted with plaster mouldings once sprung, now hangs a diaphanous veil of plywood, perforated with the geometry of the original mouldings. The layers of bolted timber echo the depth of the original plaster, while the whole thing can be illuminated from the front or behind, like a theatrical gauze curtain, to reveal the hidden workings in the roof cavity. It is a startling sight, possessing the quality of fine lacework gently draped over the burnt-out carcass.“After the fire, we were faced with the question of quite how much to restore,” says Tompkins. “We thought of the building as a kind of architectural tape recorder of everything that’s happened to it over the years – physically, politically, socially – so decided that putting it all back would have been ludicrous.”It was the right decision. The scorched surface of exposed brick and plaster lends the room an atmospheric patina that it simply didn’t have in its previous state, while the new veiled ceiling allows all of the technical requirements to be incorporated above, as well as improving the acoustic with the additional volume. New triple-glazed windows will also allow BAC to put on amplified events here without annoying its neighbours. Like the rest of the rambling complex, it provides an inspiring stage for whatever the next generation of directors want to throw at it.• The Battersea Arts Centre relaunches on 6 September with a celebratory Phoenix Season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a858771b2abacfdfc6cdb2de0e6fc760203ae11/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4780fe926aa6fc4a11634f6cdd80035","title":"booming global stock markets swell ranks of the super rich","story":"Almost 30,000 people joined the ranks of the global super-rich last year, as booming global stock markets boosted the fortunes of the already very-rich and tipped them over into the ultra-high-net-worth bracket.Collectively, the quarter-of-a-million UHNW people have a combined fortune of $31.5tn – almost double the GDP of the US.“The broad upturn in global financial markets and the reflation trade from higher interest rates were among the drivers of robust wealth gains,” the report said. “The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US currency so domestic rates largely followed the upward path set by the US central bank.

And the most discussed player in the world of football, and beyond, is one that has been ousted from the NFL for over a year: Colin Kaepernick.One week before the first NFL Sunday of the year, Nike rolled out a preview of its 30th anniversary Just Do It ad. This year its signature campaign featured the face of none other than Kaepernick, untouched and unfiltered, with the words: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” The image was striking, but the nine words far more. It brought to attention the embattled quarterback’s stance against police violence and institutional racism, which began two seasons ago when Kaepernick started kneeling on the field during the national anthem.The image of Kaepernick’s protest is forever embedded in the memory of NFL fans everywhere, as well as the NFL brass who ousted him after a fine 2016 season. However, the last time Kaepernick suited up for an NFL contest and took a knee was 1 January 2017, just over two weeks before Donald Trump was inaugurated president of the United States and 10 months before Kaepernick filed a collusion case against the NFL. This is a lifetime for millions upon millions of NFL fans, who just drafted their fantasy football teams and are gearing up for week 1.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s North America vice-president for brand marketing, told ESPN: “We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward.” With its new ad, Nike has thrust Kaepernick – and the professional sacrifice he made for his political beliefs – back into the center of football and broader political conversation.Instantly, casual fans, diehard NFL backers and activists were back at it, questioning why a quarterback, still relatively young for the position (30 years old) and having competed a good 2016 season (16 touchdowns versus only four interceptions), was being locked out of the league. The ad gave new legs to arguments made last year, when it became clear that Kaepernick was being denied the opportunity to compete for an NFL roster spot because of his protest. Pro-Kaepernick NFL fans questioned why other journeymen quarterbacks were being signed to extended contracts, statistically inferior backups were still circulating through the league and, in the case of Nathan Peterman, signal callers that threw more interceptions in one game than Kaepernick did in the entire 2016 season were named starting quarterbacks.Nike knows a winner when it sees one. A winner that will not only resonate in the market in the form of shoe and apparel sales, but a symbol that represents a sport at the crossroads. With its new ad, Kaepernick is more than just the face of Nike. He remains the face of the very league that blacklisted him, and an ever-looming and potent reminder of the unfairness of NFL’s zero-tolerance policy against athletes, particularly black athletes, that use their platforms to protest against the ubiquitous injustices plaguing black communities.Kaepernick and all he represents will be on the minds of fans watching, and those abstaining from watching, football this weekend, and throughout the 2018 regular season. Nike’s ad will be played and replayed and showcased globally on billboards and social media spots: it will serve as a ubiquitous reminder of Kaepernick’s sacrifice, but just as importantly, the injustice the NFL served upon him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e05e2d8baa16687c5aecbd659bb95823900d4e/0_124_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd17cb508c31feec9f2aed0f2ab7f99","title":"hidden costs being single","story":"Ordinarily, we like to scare the bejesus out of our youth, in the hope they’ll turn out even more boring and compliant than we are. (“Sex’ll give you gonorrhoea. Drugs’ll kill you. Rock’n’roll died with Amy Winehouse – here’s Ed Sheeran!”) And there’s another kind of aberrant behaviour that society wants to prevent. Kids be warned – we’ve made singledom appallingly expensive!According to research carried out by the Good Housekeeping Institute, “being single carries a price penalty of at least £2,000 a year per inidual”. Totting up the figures, I beg to differ. That is a conservative estimate.First, the government is intent on creating an anti-single state. The most egregious example of this is council tax: on average – in a band D home – you must pay £835 per person if you are married, and a whopping £1,235 if you live on your lonesome. Tory governments, usually so in favour of cutting taxes no matter the social cost, just love keeping them high for singletons. Is it fair to financially punish those who have failed to find true and lasting love?Our gym memberships are more expensive, our wills are more expensive, even our single person-sized milk cartons are, you guessed it, more expensive. And that’s without examining all the small print. On holiday, we pay extra to sleep alone, fly alone and eat alone.Then there’s the issue of insurance premiums. “According to insurers, I’d be a better driver tomorrow if I got hitched today,” the financial journalist Emma Lunn has complained. “You can put it to the test by comparing quotes with identical details except marital status.”Of course, things could be worse. We might be living in America. A 2013 survey of the costs of being single found that, factoring in the price of healthcare, “over a lifetime, unmarried women can pay as much as a million dollars more than their married counterparts”. No wonder that every time Beyoncé sings about single ladies the chorus consists of a load of “uh-oh’s”.Some might argue we shouldn’t worry about the single premium: we’ll all be cajoled into marriage at some point and so rid ourselves of it eventually. But, as Rebecca Traister pointed out in her book All the Single Ladies, there are more unmarried women alive today than at any point in history – and we’re a powerful demographic.If a woman is single past a certain age, society heaps all the blame – for blame is what it insists on heaping – on her. The birth rate is said to be falling not because many men don’t want to commit but because women are too busy or too picky or too high-powered and put off having children.Actually, my single friends and I have invested heavily in trying to find a partner we love who loves us so much we become pregnant. On top of all our other single-centric outgoings, according to Match we spend on average £1,280 a year on dates (mine have been utterly parlous). I’ve been searching for love since Tinder was invented and all I have to show for it is the lousy state of my bank account. Along with my best friends, I’m fretting about how to have children if conditions don’t improve on the love front. And yes, a single woman’s fertility treatment will cost her twice as much as if she were going through it with a partner.In the meantime, we’ve also spent a fortune celebrating everyone else’s happinesses – buying house-warming gifts, engagement presents, splurging on hen dos, weddings, christenings. Once, I found a card in a shop that read: “It’s better to have loved and lost than to have spent your life with a psychopath.” And I wish I’d punched the air and borne it home because it’s the closest any cultural artefact has come to celebrating me and my life choices (aside from a book that I wrote myself).And we’re not just made poorer financially – we’re all but bankrupt culturally. In the 90s, there was Kim Cattrall vamping it up on HBO proving we weren’t sadsacks now the closest thing we have to a standard bearer for our generation is Fleabag, and who would want to be her?If you’re past a certain age, everyone expects you to be married with children and if you’re not, complete strangers will demand to know why. Staying single is presented as petrifying on all fronts. The crippling price of remaining so is only one – significant – part of it.• Emily Hill is a journalist, and the author of Bad Romance"},{"url":null,"title":"late night roundup jimmy kimmel kaepernick nike","story":"Late-night comics discussed the outrage over Colin Kaepernick’s Nike ad and the revelations from Bob Woodward’s Trump exposéLate-night hosts arrived back after a vacation to discuss the Nike controversy, supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Bob Woodward’s new book on Donald Trump.On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about how people are ripping the Nike logo from socks. “Finally something dumber than eating Tide pods,” he remarked.He continued: “It’s a powerful statement that says: ‘I have too many socks.’”It’s the latest protest from Trump supporters against a company and Kimmel went on to sum them all up.“It’s kind of hilarious if you think about it,” he sais. “All of these guys who voted for Trump, now they can’t watch the NFL, they can’t ride Harleys, they have to burn their Nikes, they can’t go to Starbucks or watch Netflix, they have to love Vladimir Putin and hate the FBI … I mean, if this was a practical joke, it would be one of the greatest practical jokes of all time.”He added: “Why not just burn your money? You already bought the clothes.”On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert referred to events in the White House as “historically crazy stuff” before commenting that his initial wish to discuss what happened over the last fortnight in detail was curtailed at the last minute.“It seems like an explosive book about the Trump White House comes out every few minutes,” he said in reference to Bob Woodward’s new book, Fear.Colbert joked that it is “a book named after the emotion Trump feels after he sees a book”.In Woodward’s exposé, he reveals many shocking details about Trump’s presidency, including his repeated jabs at the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who he apparently called a “dumb southerner”.“Not all southerners are dumb, just the ones willing to work for you,” Colbert said.On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host spoke about the problematic nature of a president who is under investigation then trying to confirm a new supreme court justice.“It’s like Bonnie getting arrested and saying: ‘You know who’d make a great judge? Clyde,’” he joked.Meyers also spoke about Trump’s attack on Sessions but this time referring to a tweet that criticized how two Republican candidates remain under investigation, blaming it on him. Trump tweeted that the Democrats must now love him for what he is doing.“First of all, no one loves Jeff Sessions,” Meyers said. “He looks like a haunted doll that moves whenever you look away.”Meyers continued to go into detail about how Brett Kavanaugh is being presented by both rightwing pundits and Republicans as a carpool dad. “Anyone can drive a car!” he said.“Republicans are rushing to confirm the supreme court nominee of a president under criminal investigation who’s trying to subvert the justice system to his own political ends so they can roll back voting rights, reproductive rights and workers’ rights to solidify their grip on power, and their only argument is that he’s a carpool dad,” he added.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about Nike’s new controversial campaign with Colin Kaepernick who appears next to the statement: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”“It’s also the motto of many gambling addicts,” Noah joked.He then spoke about the outrage that the ad has caused among Republicans, some of whom are now burning their Nike shoes.“Wow, people are so angry, they’re burning their own shoes?” he said. “You realize Nike already has your money, right? They’ve already got your money. You’re only hurting yourself.”He also joked: “I’d love to see how they’d protest Home Depot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f93cce44c408f8e0a54151f25d8daefe2c88940/0_79_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3a4283e821a15d56ab4496a0d2a0dbb","title":"education department teachers express political views headteachers unions","story":"Headteachers and unions vow to defy government advice after school funding cutsHeadteachers and teaching unions have said they will defy any attempts by the Department for Education to block legitimate criticism, after it issued advice warning teachers in England against expressing “political views”.A revision issued on Wednesday to the DfE’s document entitled Staffing and employment advice for schools – billed as departmental advice for school leaders, governing bodies and local authorities – contained a new paragraph with a blunt statement in a staff management section.“All staff have a responsibility to ensure that they act appropriately in terms of their behaviour, the views they express (in particular political views) and the use of school resources at all times, and should not use school resources for party political purposes,” the paragraph states.The warning, first reported by Schools Week, comes after campaigns by school leaders over budget cuts that have dogged the government, and high-profile union activity targeting parents during the previous general election campaign, which is widely believed to have cost the Conservative party votes.The DfE’s advice on the use of school resources could make it difficult to repeat campaigns by groups of headteachers to send letters to parents – in many cases on headed paper – informing them of budget cuts and urging them to lobby their MPs to increase school funding.But Jules White, a headteacher behind the Worth Less? national group of school leaders that has organised critical letters on funding, said: “If expressing political views is about biased and ill-judged grandstanding by heads and teachers, then I fully support the DfE’s views.“If, on the other hand, the DfE wishes headteachers to be gagged as they simply tell the truth about the financial and teacher supply crisis that our schools are facing then this is unacceptable.“Worth Less? always uses independent evidence from sources such as the IFS and DfE data itself to support the legitimate concerns it raises with parents and the public. Our claims are never disputed, but frequently ignored.“I will continue to lead our campaign and speak out in a reasonable and considered manner on behalf of colleagues and the children and families that we serve.”Last year, Worth Less? organised 5,000 headteachers to lobby the government, while White and his colleagues oversaw a letter sent to an estimated 2.5 million households via pupils from thousands of state schools.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “The Tories are trying to ban teachers from whistleblowing when schools cuts bite into our children’s education. They may hope to silence teachers, but they can’t get away from the fact that they will have cut £3bn from school budgets by 2020.“If the government wants to know why teachers are publicly criticising them, they need only look at their own record of broken promises. They even cancelled their ‘guarantee’ that every school would receive a cash increase.”Geoff Barton, a former headteacher who is now general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, derided the DfE’s advice and suggested it would be unlikely to deter teachers from campaigning.“It is perfectly reasonable for school leaders and teachers to be able to articulate their concerns … and it is clearly in the public interest for them to have a voice. You cannot disenfranchise 450,000 teachers from talking about education,” he said.The DfE was contacted for a response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcc37987457b70a60bc08e0a78ff5d5aa72fcf29/2395_353_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40924f5e3f88c3f0fdd3550ff9c0ef28","title":"chief rabbi calls on jewish schools to tackle homophobia","story":"Ephraim Mirvis says many LGBT+ pupils in Orthodox schools ‘endure deep distress’The chief rabbi has issued guidance for Orthodox Jewish schools on providing support for LGBT+ students, saying there is a religious duty to protect young people and their families.The unprecedented document, described as a milestone, is likely to get a hostile reception from some Orthodox Jews who refuse to acknowledge ersity in sexual orientation or gender identity.Some ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools have been criticised by Ofsted for failing to teach pupils about LGBT+ issues and censoring textbooks that refer to sexual or gender ersity.The Wellbeing of LGBT+ Pupils: A Guide for Orthodox Jewish Schools is produced by Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, in conjunction with KeshetUK, an organisation that advocates for LGBT+ rights in the Jewish community. The guidance calls for a zero-tolerance approach to homophobic or transphobic bullying.In an introduction, Mirvis says many LGBT+ students in Jewish schools “endure deep unhappiness and distress due to the mistreatment and hurt they experience”.There is a religious obligation to provide support and guidance, he adds. Schools must introduce “robust behaviour policies that will enable all students to achieve their potential, free from bullying, discrimination and fear”.Mirvis says: “Orthodox schools have understandably found it difficult to engage with LGBT+ issues. As challenging as the task might be, and it is exceptionally challenging, I believe that failure to address it at all amounts to an abrogation of our responsibility to the Almighty and to our children.”Although the guide is aimed at schools, its significance is expected to resonate widely among Orthodox Jews because of its use of religious texts to challenge widespread intolerance of LGBT+ people.Last year the Orthodox Jewish community in the UK was ided by a bitter row over a senior rabbi’s comments about homosexuality, which led to him being accused of heresy and corruption.Joseph Dweck, the senior rabbi of the UK Sephardi community, said there should not be witch-hunts against gay people, adding there were “plenty of skeletons in everybody’s closet”.A few months later, a group of ultra-Orthodox rabbis called for a boycott of a Jewish cultural centre in London because it held a gay-themed week of events and provided a meeting space for gay Jewish parents.The schools guide cites a passage in the Talmud, the primary source of religious law, which teaches that there is an absolute obligation to save a person in a life-threatening situation.“Any person who doubts that there are young LGBT+ people in our schools who have been left feeling so isolated that their very lives are in danger has simply failed to grasp the reality confronting some of our students,” it says.Quoting another passage, “Whoever humiliates another in public forfeits their place in the world to come”, it adds: “Judaism demands that we never stand idly by when someone is being bullied and humiliated.”The guide is believed to be the first of its kind produced for any Othodox Jewish community in the world.Mirvis said the document was a significant milestone that would have “a real and lasting impact on reducing harm to LGBT+ Jews across the Orthodox Jewish community”. He added: “Our children need to know that at school, at home and in the community, they will be loved and protected regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.”Dalia Fleming, of KeshetUK, said the organisation looked “forward to working with schools, rabbis and educators across Jewish communities, supporting them to implement this guide so they can ensure their LGBT+ students reach their potential, free from homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying, discrimination and fear”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf434a0c146d9a04166ae3c4cf7b49d0b742c5ad/0_94_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8f73b0ccaf4d11bc3e2021467ef51e3","title":"earth photo 2018 shortlist in pictures","story":"The inaugural Earth Photo exhibition presents 50 stunning images and films that document the Earth in all its ersity, from remote tribes to our changing climate "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfbd7dd44b13bece29f2cec2c73a57395b3a4406/0_175_2914_1748/master/2914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5469e509b008e7fb5693abfb228fa54e","title":"reign of the scumbro the meaning of justin biebers ugly style","story":"The hottest trend in men’s fashion involves looking badly dressed in oversized trousers, obscure graphic T-shirts and ridiculous shoes and hatsAm I just getting old or are young male celebrities dressing really badly these days? Charlotte, by emailIt is a fact that people’s eyes don’t work properly until they are 25, which is why when they see Justin Bieber wearing ripped bleached jeans, cowboy boots and a ludicrous fur jacket with even more ludicrous fur hood, they don’t make boring tut-tut noises, but immediately Google “Bieber fur jacket asos!!!!” Life is definitely more fun when you’re young.Thus, noticing the ludicrousness of celebrities’ outfits is a worrying moment in one’s adult life. What next, you ask fearfully, clutching your Blue Harbour button-down shirt – will I start commenting on the absurd price of takeaway coffee? The bewildering youth of policemen?But I am happy to reassure you, Charlotte, that your age has nothing to do with your observation: yes, male celebrities are dressing really badly and, yes, it is deliberate. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the hottest male fashion trend of 2018: “scumbros”.“Scumbro? What is a scumbro?” you ask, weeping into your Gap khakis. I shall explain. Scumbros wear oversized, overpriced skatewear by labels such as Palace and Supreme, obscure graphic T-shirts, ridiculous shoes and even more ridiculous hats. They also wear wildly expensive labels, such as Gucci, Versace and Prada, but deliberately make them look terrible. Shia LaBeouf is a scumbro, while the Justins Bieber and Theroux are wannabe scumbros. When someone wrote on Twitter, correctly: “Diplo starting to look like a dude that sells you bad weed on the Venice boardwalk,” Diplo was so chuffed he posted it on Instagram and wrote underneath: “Goals achieved.” Total scumbro move.Jonah Hill, according to Vanity Fair, is “king of the scumbros”: he has “pretty good taste”, a men’s fashion expert is quoted as saying beneath a photo of Hill in a T-shirt that looks like a rainbow vomited on it, wide-legged trousers and a pair of white slip-ons of the type my grandfather would wear, thus confirming that Zoolander was not a satire, but a documentary. When the Wall Street Journal ran a photospread of celebrity scumbros recently, it priced up their outfits and they ran into the high hundreds and thousands, even though all the men featured looked as if they’d lost a fight with a 14-year-old’s laundry basket. The celebrity who took the scumbro trend to the mainstream was a chap by the name of Pete Davidson. Until earlier this year, Davidson was known as a cockyobnoxious comedian from Saturday Night Live who looked like the friend of your younger brother whom you occasionally allow yourself to fancy in your drunker moments, only to quash the thought the next morning and swear off alcohol for ever. Since he became the fiance of singer Ariana Grande, Davidson has found himself atop the pinnacle of the celebrity pyramid, and his ludicrous scumbro looks have been, via his alliance with Grande, forced on the world.Grande’s teenage fanbase, who always delighted in their idol’s polished feminine style, have, with some reluctance, learned to endure the sight of Davidson’s oversized camouflage-print tracksuits and endless baseball caps. One of the most widely published photos from Aretha Franklin’s funeral last week was of President Clinton, Grande and … Davidson. Oh sure, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson were all at the funeral, but let’s illustrate the death of one of the all-time great singers with a picture of a 24-year-old dude and his peroxide hair who probably couldn’t do an Aretha song on a karaoke night.For men, when it comes to fashion, looking as if you’re not trying has always been essential to looking cool – but that, of course, is nonsense. If you don’t try, you buy whatever you find first from John Lewis. Johnny Depp’s (extremely tired) rock’n’roll Keith Richards-lite look, or Owen Wilson’s surfer dude style requires effort. And I salute effort! As my beloved Tan France from Queer Eye argues, there is no shame in a man making an effort to look good. What’s interesting about scumbro is that it is simultaneously supposed to look as if it takes no effort while emphasising how much effort it takes. Sure, that puffa jacket and trucker cap might look like something you found in a bin, but they are made by labels inaccessible to most people. It is snobby and ugly and therefore possibly the ultimate young male celebrity’s fashion trend. To quote the ultimate nonscumbro, Dolly Parton, it costs a lot of money to look this cheap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4d8acf1165b6dbcc111576ef964c1e349da3b8/0_0_5642_3385/master/5642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae86eb7d2aa920adb7888603ebdfc53","title":"are japanese souffle pancakes worth the wait","story":"These towering souffle-style pancakes are light and lovely, yet satisfyingly eggy – but the 20-minute cooking time feels like foodie purgatory Even in the increasingly filthy world of food porn, these fluffy pancake clouds seem especially X-rated. Perform a Google image search for “Japanese wobbly pancake” – not in the office, obviously they’re strictly NSFW – and you will see what I mean. There they are, lolloping gently on top of each other, drizzled in syrup, dolloped with cream, and all the while teasing you that they might just float away before you get to taste them.They certainly proved to be elusive. My first attempt to sample them was thwarted after Fuwa Fuwa – the only place in the UK that seems to sell them – ended its east London pop-up residency on the day I was planning to visit. Of course, I wasn’t sad enough to spend the next few months refreshing its Instagram feed every morning, drooling afresh at the pictures. No, it was pure coincidence that, as soon as Fuwa Fuwa opened again at a new central London base, I was knocking on the door with a similarly pancake-enthralled friend.These towering, souffle-style pancakes have been a craze in Japan for a few years – Cafe Gram in Tokyo created the biggest buzz – although, while the rest of the world plays catchup, the Japanese have already moved on to fluffy pancake kebabs.How do they differ from normal pancakes? The basic gist is that the chef separates the whites from the egg, chills them, and then whips up a meringue mix before folding in the yolk and remaining ingredients. Chilling the whites helps keep the batter firm, allowing the pancake-makers to double stack the mix on an electric griddle for impressive height. They slowly brown them underneath before gently rolling them over to finish them off.Agonisingly, upon ordering, we discover a catch. These pancakes are so delicate that they need to be cooked very slowly at a low temperature – and, as everything at Fuwa Fuwa is made to order, that meant a 20-minute wait with nothing but Oolong tea for company. If purgatory for foodies exists, then this is what it feels like.Fuwa Fuwa’s toppings are all ludicrously tempting: salted-caramel miso and popcorn banana and Nutella. We opt for honeycomb butter on one, and blueberry and yuzu cheesecake on the other. As delicious as they sound, these add-ons had a tendency to overpower the sheer majesty of the pancakes, which are not only as light and lovely as they look but satisfyingly eggy, too. They will not win you many wellness points – I leave feeling giddy, as if I have spent the afternoon inhaling candyfloss – but as a one off, it’s a thumbs-up. And be warned: whether you have waited hours, weeks or months to try these pancakes, they are unlikely to stay on your plate for longer than a minute.

Sourced everywhere from Zambian forests to Irish meadows and London rooftops, there is a flavour to suit everyoneGot a cough? Then before you pick up an over-the-counter medicine, or head to your GP, try a little honey. Who would have thought that in the 21st century, this folk remedy would become the first line of treatment? But it has. New proposed guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and Public Health England (PHE) say that there is some limited evidence that honey can help improve cough symptoms.This official thumbs-up for honey is a turn up for the books. These days, the mere mention of “traditional medicine” or “home remedies” provokes knee-jerk howls of “Quackery!”. Yet modern scientific research validating the age-old view that honey has medicinal properties is stacking up. There is data to show that honey helps relieve irritation in the mouth or throat by forming a protective film, and soothes coughs caused by upper respiratory tract infections and alleviates symptoms more than certain common over-the-counter medicines. Honey has a number of other well-documented health benefits, including encouraging faster wound healing and shortening the life of cold sores. New Zealand manuka honey can even inhibit the growth of MRSA, enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.One of the interesting things about honey, even the blander types, is that it has a much more characterful, some would say obtrusive, taste than neutral table sugar (sucrose), and this makes it a self-limiting option for most. If I baked a sponge and “iced” it thickly with honey, I’d wager that very few people would be able to eat much of it. Top the same cake with sugary frosting and it would get eaten up much faster. It is actually difficult to overeat honey.The pronounced scents and flavours of honey are one of the reasons why modern food manufacturers use it only in relatively small quantities. They tend to prefer glucose-fructose syrup, an industrial form of sugar, because it behaves more predictably in a factory than quirky honey and costs much less.But if you want to take advantage of honey’s medicinal properties, what is the best type to eat? Honey that is still in the comb fits the bill, but if you prefer your honey without wax, what you want is “raw” honey: one that hasn’t been excessively heated or ultra-filtered to remove valuable “impurities”, such as traces of pollen and propolis, the resin from hives. This way it will retain its medicinally useful micronutrients.Unfortunately, “raw” is a term with no precise legal meaning and honey, just like olive oil, is notorious for food fraud. Both are arguments for buying your raw honey as close to home as possible from accountable sellers who are transparent about where their bees get their nectar – is it from organic, wild, urban or pesticide-treated land? – and who can provide chapter and verse on their extraction methods. If you read the label on the more ubiquitous honey brands, you will see that they generally contain an anonymous mix of honeys from countries in and outside the European Union, blended to give a “consistent”, some might say dully sweet, taste.If you have ever fallen in love with a fragrant, runny honey abroad and brought it home only to find that it solidifies in cool British temperatures, this doesn’t mean your honey has gone “off”. Honey’s shelf life is eternal – ancient Egyptians used it as embalming fluid – but all types of honey crystallise eventually. That said, commercial honeys obtained through higher heat treatment and fine filtering do remain runny for longer. Raw honey, on the other hand, tends to crystallise faster because the minute particles of pollen, propolis and wax encourage crystals to form. Moving the jar to a warm place or sitting it in warm water will restore raw honey to its liquid form without killing off its medicinal benefits.There is a dazzling ersity of good raw honeys out there. As a general guide, chestnut and pine honeys have the strongest scents and flavours, heather sits somewhere in the middle, and acacia and clover come in at the milder end of the spectrum. Twelve honeys were awarded the top three-star rating in the 2018 Great Taste awards. These included pine and smilax aspera (a flowering vine) honey from the Greek village of Agia Paraskevi ivy flower honey from County Limerick multi-floral honey from Exmoor a honey from rooftop hives and gardens in central London and heather honey from high Peak District moorland. Judges tried to put words to the remarkable range of perfumes and tastes: “smoky and treacly” (honey from a Rwandan forest) “sharp, clean, almost grapefruit” (London honey) “earthy liquorice notes” (organic Greek chestnut honey) “evocative of walks in tropical woodlands” (Zambian forest honey from bark hives).Shops and market stalls selling good raw honey usually encourage you to sample, so it is fun to work out your favourite. Raw honey is never cheap, but then a small spoonful of such a precious natural commodity goes a long way – especially, it seems, on a miserable winter night when you can’t stop coughing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f7add85747524df9cfd3d524c61d801070fff7/0_66_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=239544ee58e622cece131e7493fa2785","title":"english premier league gareth southgate","story":"Emboldened by the World Cup and perhaps conscious of opportunity ahead, Gareth Southgate has called for a debate into the “ethical challenge” of increasing the number of English players competing regularly in the Premier League. The debate is under way from academy to government level and though causes of the problem are easier to identify than solutions, it is not a conversation the Football Association will allow to fall silent.“Our pool is getting smaller and smaller,” Southgate said last week, when, holding his first press conference since the World Cup, he delivered a statistical sting to the positivity generated by England’s run to the semi-finals.Chelsea and Arsenal are lowest on the list with a combined 172 minutes for Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ross Barkley plus a mere 56 minutes in total for Danny Welbeck and Ainsley Maitland-Niles respectively. Offering the most opportunity so far are Burnley and Bournemouth, the only clubs to have given English players over 2,000 minutes of Premier League football after four matches.Southgate cited “the precarious nature of managers in the top flight” as helping contribute to the decline. Aidy Boothroyd, England’s Under–21 manager, believes an overseas manager’s inclination to look abroad for talent is another factor. Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe, the longest serving managers in the top flight, support both theories.“There has never been a better time to be an England player, whatever age,” says Boothroyd. International honours back him up with England having won the World Cup at under-20 and under-17 level plus the under–19s European Championship last summer. However, there is a “ceiling of development” that Boothroyd fears undoubtedly exists in the Premier League. Lewis Cook and Dominic Calvert-Lewin feature regularly for Bournemouth and Everton respectively but none of England’s Under-20s World Cup-winning team from 2017 have established themselves as a first-team starter.England’s Under-21 manager, who is concerned about Dominic Solanke’s lack of game-time at Liverpool before Thursday’s Euro qualifier against the Netherlands, adds: “In the past you had British managers giving British players a lot of chances to prove they could do it. Now the game is global. I look at my old club Watford, and it is a completely different club to the one that I was at. Foreign owners and foreign managers might perhaps look abroad before looking at what is under their nose although, ironically, the best ones tend to pick our players, so there must be something in that.”But what is the solution? “We have tried the quota one, haven’t we?” Boothroyd replies. “I really don’t have the answer. It is at a different level to where I am and I am happy on the pitch picking the best players. Young players now are thinking of playing abroad first. I admire that for many reasons, I think it is great they want to learn different languages and experience different cultures and different ways of playing, but the fact they have got to go abroad to play is a real red flag for the authorities. They will be thinking: “Hang on a minute, why is that happening?’ But I’m afraid I don’t have the answer.”Quotas could increase with Brexit, which has the potential for conflict between the FA and Premier League and may fulfil Southgate’s wish for the debate over homegrown talent to continue if nothing else.The Premier League has asked the government to clarify whether it will be exempt from restrictions on European workers after Brexit. With only six months to go, it is still awaiting an answer. The Premier League’s post-Brexit proposals will require FA support. That could be the FA’s opportunity to insist on an increase to the current quota of eight homegrown players in a 25-man squad.For Jürgen Klopp, the anti-Brexit Liverpool manager, the issue facing English players and the game’s authorities is the quality and competitiveness of the Premier League, a competition that has thrived globally due to access to the world’s finest talent. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson demonstrate opportunity exists at Liverpool – and support Boothroyd’s point about the best foreign managers looking under their noses – while Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would have increased the club’s England contingent but for injury.“If a German international moves to the Premier League he probably doesn’t start as often as he did before,” says Klopp. “It happens in other countries too. Emre Can didn’t start so far for Juve. Will he be a starter? I have no solution because I didn’t think about it in terms of English football, to be honest, but how I see it is that English football in their development with the young boys is in a really good way.At Chelsea, Maurizio Sarri concurs. “I was asked the same question in Italy: why is it so difficult for Italian players to play at the big clubs in Italy?” he says. “I think it’s normal. It’s difficult to play here, difficult to play in Juventus, because in this club there are 27 or 28 great players. It’s difficult.”The difficulties have prompted English players to join Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Wolfsburg in recent months. According to one Premier League academy director, the trend is also happening at junior level and will only accelerate post-Brexit.“The talent is there, it is just about being given an opportunity,” maintains James Maddison, who has flourished on his introduction to the Premier League with Leicester City. “I’m not sure what we can do to combat the problem but the talent is there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6315fb5014b1125c247aa18331df4b5eb95d4554/0_82_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10dc888e0f0c69fc27f99214e3c1b2f8","title":"nations league uefa internationals","story":"Type Uefa Nations League into an internet search engine and you will be greeted by a plethora of bewildered voices. From Harry Maguire who admitted the England team were baffled, to Gareth Southgate who struggled to wrap his head around the complicated format not to mention the fans, many of whom had little knowledge of it happening until this week.So what is it and should we even care? When Uefa announced the tournament’s structure in October 2017 it was met with confusion. The format is enough to make the brain ache but the basic premise is that the 55 European nations are ided into four leagues, determined by each country’s Uefa ranking last November.The governing body insists it will shake up the international football landscape outside major tournaments, helping eliminate that miserable drudge of meaningless friendlies between World Cups and European Championships. The Football Association anticipates it will lead to England having a consistent run of games against high-level opponents – a good thing for a young and relatively inexperienced group of players.Southgate’s team are in League\u0026nbspA alongside 11 other leading sides, including Belgium, Germany and France. These are then split into four mini-leagues of three teams. In England’s case that will mean matches against Spain and Croatia home and away in the first batch of games between September and November. The four pool winners of League A advance to a mini‑tournament to decide the overall champion next summer. Some are mischievously saying it could be England’s best chance to win a trophy since 1966.So far, so confusing. As with any new venture there is likely to be a teething period where no one is quite sure what is going on but optimists would point out that we are starting from a relatively low point as the popularity of international football has been on the wane for years.The idea of a Nations League was first floated in 2013 in a Uefa executive committee meeting and was the brainchild of the Uefa president, Michel Platini, who has since been banned from the game. It was one of several options mentioned as part of a discussion about how to improve the attractiveness of international football, which has struggled to maintain its allure amid the continued rise of the club game. Platini also hoped it would help to drive up the TV rights income. “The friendlies don’t really interest anybody – neither the fans nor the players nor the media and nor the national associations,” he said in 2014. “This is a good decision because nobody wants these friendlies.”For England, the match against Spain on Saturday night at Wembley will be their first game since the Russia World Cup, where the team enjoyed an unexpected and rousing run to the semi-finals before losing to Croatia. The stock of the national side is the highest for two decades and it might be viewed as a missed opportunity that their homecoming match is not on terrestrial TV.The match will be shown live on Sky Sports, with highlights on ITV, but it will be the first time live coverage of an entire senior international tournament is denied to terrestrial viewers. ITV and Sky have paid a combined £200m for the rights to England matches between 2018 and 2022, with ITV still showing European Championship and World Cup qualifiers. But for a new group of fans, enticed by the team’s exploits in Russia, it will be disappointing their homecoming fixture is not on free-to-air TV.The Nations League will feature promotion and relegation between the groups and the additional carrot is the possibility of qualification for Euro 2020. The traditional qualifiers, held from March to November 2019, will decide 20 of the 24 finalists but the remaining spots will be decided by play-offs between the top ranked teams from the Nations League groups who have not already qualified.The Uefa’s president, Aleksander Cerefin, believes it will further improve the competitiveness of European sides. The continent has already produced 12 of the 16 semi-finalists at the past four World Cups.“The relationship between club and national-team football needed rebalancing,” Ceferin said. “That was the thinking behind the Uefa Nations League. In every even year there are World Cups or European Championships. Now in every odd year there will be a Uefa Nations League champion. Football is about competition and now, just like in club football, there will be a national team champion at the close of every season.”Fifpro, the world players’ union, warned that a new competition would add to the strain on players, making it more difficult to rest senior professionals and give a chance to blood youngsters. But the challenge for the Nations League in the first instance will be winning round those sceptical voices.Uefa’s all-new tournament, replacing most international friendlies. It’ll revive the football calendar, they say. Others aren’t convinced.\u0026nbspHow does it work?The short answer, the one favoured by critics, is that it doesn’t – that it’s a money-led mess. The long answer, favoured by Uefa, is that it’s a clever format, full of intrigue, which works like this. All 55 Uefa nations have been split into four leagues, A to D, based on their coefficient rankings – then split again into four internal groups, A2, C3, D1 and so on. Teams in the groups will play each other home and away over a 10-week period, starting today.\u0026nbspSo what’s at stake?Uefa’s credibility, plus a few more  tangible things. There’s promotion and relegation between the tiers a trophy to be fought over by the four League A group winners, via a special play-off series and  there’s the big source of controversy – the complicated way it all links in to Euro 2022. \u0026nbspSo teams can qualify for 2020 through this format?\u0026nbspThey can. There are four 2020 places on offer via the Nations League, one for each league, to be won via play-offs involving the four best-ranked sides in each tier who haven’t already qualified via the normal process. If there aren’t four unqualified sides left in one tier, the best team from the tier below moves up, although, to be fair to group winners, they will not have to face teams from a higher league.\u0026nbsp And there’s lots more small print where that came from.So you can lose all your 2020 qualifiers, and still qualify?Correct. It’s good news for big nations who go to pieces during the standard qualifying process, and for minnows who would normally have next-to-no chance of reaching the finals via the usual route. Critics say it makes a mockery of that usual route Uefa say they are “just  keeping the dream alive for everyone”.\u0026nbspWhat does the trophy look like?This. It’s 7.5kg and 71cm tall. Hélder Pombinho, creative director of the brand agency responsible for designing it, says: “It represents the pinnacle of a nation – the raising of a flag.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba16a375a34236d27876a5d55fdb9bb2a60ef5ed/0_568_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e340e5e7e6f7928089614632cf6b8472","title":"good pub guide 2019 pubs urged to keep food simple","story":"Latest Good Pub Guide says drinkers put off by baffling, ‘pretentious’, menus at pubsBritain’s pubs are being urged to “ditch the fancy food” and stick to meals such as ploughman’s lunches and bangers and mash. The Good Pub Guide 2019 said pretentious and inaccessible menus were a turn-off for pub-goers. The 37th edition of the guide, published on Thursday, features more than 5,000 pubs on the basis of people’s recommendations, backed up by editor visits and inspections. In addition to official reviews there are online listings for another 40,000 pubs across the UK.Contributors generally welcomed the rise in culinary standards over the past decade, which in many cases saved pubs from closure, but feared it could have backfired, with overambitious menus featuring unrecognisable ingredients.The guide said: “Pubs and good food now go hand in hand, but many chefs appear to have gone Masterchef-mad. We really aren’t interested in eating kabsa, katsuobushi, matbucha, succotash, tataki or verjus in a pub. We don’t want our dishes adorned with carrot fluff, edible sand or fish ‘foam’. Leave that to the swanky restaurants. We want good, honest pub grub.”Picking up the award for value pub of the year is the Old Castle in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. In 12 years as landlord, Bryn Masterman has built up a reputation for homemade classics such as fish pie, steak pie and roasted lamb shank.“We pride ourselves on our range of hearty, homemade, food made from quality local ingredients,” Masterman said. “Probably the bravest thing we did was to serve real horse steaks just after the horsemeat scandal. Our customers really enjoyed them.”Fiona Stapley, the guide’s editor, said: “In the 37 years of the Good Pub Guide’s existence, fancy food fads have come and gone, but what always stands fast is honest cooking using tip-top local, seasonal, ingredients, but ones that we can all recognise.”Elizabeth Carter, consultant editor of the Good Food Guide, said she was no fan of “pretentious lists of ingredients devoid of prepositions, participles or conjunctions that you have to ask waiting staff to explain, for ‘beef, sprouts, coffee’ only invites puzzlement and a battalion of questions. After all, it’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary.”The guide awarded top spot to the Cornish seafood restaurant Nathan Outlaw for the second year running, after it notched up a perfect cooking score of 10 for the third year in a row.Clare Smyth\u0027s West London restaurant Core entered the top 10 at number three – the highest new entry in the guide’s history – and received a score of 10, behind Simon Rogan\u0027s L\u0027Enclume in Cumbria.Elsewhere in the Good Pub Guide, a village pub – The Cock in Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire –which sells real ale and 20 different wines, with a “bustling” atmosphere, has been named pub of the year for the second time. The pub  also sells local cider, has a bar just for drinkers, wood-burning stoves and a busy separate restaurant.The pub guide also crowned its first gin pub of the year, The Cholmondeley Arms, in Cheshire, which stocks 365 different gins.

And she said that despite the controversy Humphrys was well liked by his audience.“Everyone has a strong view on the Today programme and almost no one agrees with each other,” said Sands. “John has a big following amongst listeners.”Asked whether Humphrys’ veteran status meant he would be able to choose when he leaves the show, Sands replied: “Everyone will decide when it seems right. And he above all will know when it feels right.“He\u0027s extremely curious, he\u0027s extremely engaged, fantastically interested in new subjects and new people and real people. The overall purpose in him is pursuit of truth.”Sands also said Humphrys, who was caught mocking his fellow BBC presenter Carrie Gracie’s complaints about unequal pay, took the issue of pay seriously. She said he had already accepted a “huge cut” to his salary after it was revealed he earned substantially more than some of his Today co-hosts – sparking an informal boycott of him by some female MPs.“We’ve all learned that jokes are very difficult to take in these times,” said Sands.Sands has been the editor of Today since early 2017 and has attempted to reposition the programme as a “top-level briefing” for the day ahead covering a broader range of subjects – an approach which has not always been received well. Earlier this year official figures showed the programme had shed 800,000 listeners, which she blamed partly on the comedown from a period of intense news after last year’s general election and the Grenfell Tower disaster.Speaking to journalists at a meeting of the Broadcasting Press Guild, she said that “the main complaint” from listeners was the continued day-to-day coverage of Brexit, which she described as a “sluggish” story but one the show remained committed to.“The Today programme should always be at the eye of the storm. It should be where all stories, issues and themes of the day are played out and – as the political heat rises – provide its 7 million listeners a clear briefing of what’s going on, with due impartiality, without fear or favour.”Sands also said that the “narrowness and intensity of the rage” that the programme attracts from Twitter users, especially on topics such as Brexit, is not always reflected in the broader response from members of the public where complaints are split “50-50” between remain and leave supporters.She suggested it would be easier to cover Brexit as the actual impact of Britain leaving the EU became clearer: “Now you’re starting to see a bit the practical implications. In the end facts will prevail, but until now it’s been partial facts or projections an awful lot of the time from both sides.”The editor said the slight increase in arts coverage on the programme reflected the fact that “people aren’t spending their entire lives talking about the findings of select committees” and suggested that she was not always a fan of Thought for the Day, Radio 4’s daily religious slot, which is not produced by the Today team but is broadcast during the show.“When I first came I thought, ‘Thought for the Day – could that go to Newsnight?’ It\u0027s odd if you thought about it in any other programme but that’s slightly to do with the heritage of this programme. It’s there because it’s always been there and it’s part of Britain.”Sands also announced plans to launch a new Today programme podcast by the end of the of the year to expand its audience. She said she had come to accept that her tenure in charge of the programme would be criticised regardless: “It\u0027s a bit like being England football manager, everyone’s got a view.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b5146790b0db0f822300d062cac8a3e8e18c645/0_32_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=27e9c37a3c7064251f133293128749da","title":"brexit brexit brexit leaders on autopilot for return of pmqs","story":"Corbyn only had to repeat the same question over and over as May struggled to respondNo one can say that Theresa May doesn\u0027t go out of her way to make things easy for Jeremy Corbyn. There was a time in their early exchanges at prime minister\u0027s questions when the Labour leader frequently failed to follow his own line of thinking and managed to confuse himself as well as his opposite number. But after some coaching from May, whose inner hopelessness one cannot help but admire, Corbyn has learned he really only has to repeat the same one-line question over and over again. Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Neither May nor Corbyn looked exactly rested for their first PMQs of the new parliamentary session – the summer months haven\u0027t been kind to either of them – but the Labour leader is rather more convincing when operating on autopilot than the prime minister. He forced an eye open, asked which of her ministers she agreed with over Brexit, and sat down.The prime minister looked panic-stricken and immediately went into damage limitation mode. She actually agreed with all of her cabinet, even though they were all saying completely different things. Call it collective irresponsibility. She was aiming to get a good deal, but things wouldn\u0027t be so terrible if she got a bad one.Think of it this way: back in 1918, 100 million people had died of Spanish flu and it hadn\u0027t been the end of the world. And she wasn\u0027t anticipating a death toll on anything like this scale: 20 million at the very most. What\u0027s more, a no-deal Brexit offered a whole range of exciting job opportunities. Undertakers, black marketeers, Portaloo operators on the M20. Even Bernard Matthews was enthusiastic about a no-deal. Great. Now the turkeys were voting for Brexit.While there was some irony in Corbyn lecturing May on not having a clue about what she was doing on Brexit – the Labour leader has hardly been a model of clarity – the prime minister still struggled to come up with a credible response. She tried muttering “antisemitism” a few times as a ersionary tactic, but mostly she switched to her default monotone algorithm of wanting a deep and special partnership. Finding one with herself would be a start. Her backbenchers looked miserable. When she switches to Maybot, it\u0027s invariably game over.As if anticipating her own mediocrity, May had arranged to give a statement on the Salisbury poisonings immediately after PMQs. The prime minister almost always does well on these occasions – she can do a nice line in sounding like a serious leader on most things other than Brexit and the Conservative party – and she was helped this time by having something interesting to say. Which seemed to come as much of a surprise to her as to everyone else.Usually these occasions are much ado about nothing but it turned out that the police weren\u0027t quite as useless as she had suspected. They had identified the killers as two Russian agents from the GRU who had sprayed novichok around an east London hotel – the kiss of death for that establishment – before finding a train service that hadn\u0027t been cancelled to take them down to Wiltshire to poison the Skripals.May went on to praise the European Union for standing up to the Russians – she didn\u0027t pause to wonder why we were so hellbent on leaving an institution that was so supportive – before announcing that although there was no point applying for an extradition order, she had issued a European arrest warrant for the two suspects. In hindsight, this might have been a mistake. After Brexit, it could turn out that the UK is the one place in Europe where the Russians can\u0027t be arrested.The Labour benches had made a point of emptying before the prime minister had begun her statement. A silent protest against their own leader, whom they reckon to be a liability on security matters. Under the circumstances, Corbyn acquitted himself quite well. He was never going to go the full “I hate all the Russkies, they\u0027re a load of crazy commies”, which was all that would have satisfied many of his own MPs, but he did admit that the evidence was compelling and that the actions of the Russians should be condemned.“Typical weaselly words,” bellowed Boris Johnson, showing no signs of having listened to the Labour leader and choosing instead to give the speech he had prepared earlier. It takes a weasel to know a weasel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e44a5eabf81bcccde90ab075efcdfb7251d0b1/0_28_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de31e28989d40c3828e764e5e8e4fbe","title":"starmer labour would vote down canada style brexit deal","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary says proposal backed by EU’s chief negotiator ‘cannot form basis’ of agreementThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has said during a visit to Brussels that Labour would vote against a proposed EU-UK free trade deal that is now being backed by Michel Barnier and David Davis, leaving such an arrangement with scant hope of being passed by parliament.He also described as “reckless” efforts to pretend that Theresa May’s Chequers proposals were not dead, as the value of the pound leapt in response to fresh reports that Angela Merkel was open to a more vague political declaration on the UK’s future economic and trade ties in order to get a Brexit deal done.Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and the former cabinet ministers Davis and Boris Johnson have suggested in recent days that a Canada-style deal that avoids tariffs on imports but only minimises rather than avoids checks on imports is the way forward.It has been suggested by some member states, in the face of opposition from France, that such an offer could be dressed up to allow both sides to claim a victory, in what has been described as a “blind Brexit”.But, speaking between meetings with key EU diplomats and officials including Barnier’s German deputy, Sabine Weyand, Starmer told the  that while he agreed with the European commission and Tory Eurosceptic MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Chequers proposals were dead, Labour would not accept a Canada-style deal, however it was presented.Starmer said it was clear that May’s central proposals of customs facilitation and a common rulebook on goods but not for services “cannot form the basis of a deal” and that the prime minister and others should not pretend otherwise.It was therefore vital, in order to win parliament’s support, he said, that May moved to back a deal that brought the UK further into the EU’s orbit, by negotiating a new customs union and signing up to EU acquis on both services and goods while accepting the jurisdiction of a common court.Starmer pointed out that his party had set the government the task of meeting a series of targets in order to gain its support in parliament, including that the deal offers the “exact same benefits” as the UK currently has as a member of the single market and customs union and that it delivers for all regions of the country.“At the end, the central problem for the prime minister is always the same: she has a warring party behind her, and the two sides can’t agree sufficiently to allow her to get a deal through unless she goes for a customs union plus single market deal with shared regulations and institutions. That I think would have a majority in parliament.”Starmer added: “Whatever the agreement – if there is one – it has to keep to the solemn commitment of no hard border with Northern Ireland. The only combination that will meet that commitment is a customs union with the EU and a single market deal with high alignment.”Starmer said his concern was that he did not believe May was strong enough to adapt her position without facing a challenge to her premiership.Labour has said it is keeping all options on the table, including that of a second referendum, should parliament fail to back any deal May strikes with Brussels.The two sides of the negotiations are aiming for agreement at an EU leaders’ summit next month, although an emergency summit is likely to be held in mid-November should the timeline slip.“Time is running out on the PM. As the clock runs down, the prospect of a no-deal becomes greater and a no-deal would be catastrophic. And that is why the continued blindness to the obvious problems of the Chequers plan is reckless.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86933f6d270b090b10228babe857185111d22198/0_169_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633c45167ed17bc3885486d9e0e976dd","title":"premier league betting sponsors ignore plight of uk gambling addicts","story":"NHS England chief attacks foreign betting firms that fail to pay into £10m help fund Betting firms who sponsor Premier League football clubs have been criticised by the chief executive of NHS England for apparently ignoring the industry\u0027s duty to help Britain\u0027s estimated 430,000 problem gamblers.Simon Stevens castigated foreign-owned betting companies for not contributing to a £10m fund which pays for addicts\u0027 treatment while leaving the already overburdened health service to “pick up the pieces” from gambling-related mental ill health.Eight firms whose names adorn Premier League teams\u0027 shirts are reportedly refusing to pay up, said Stevens in an address at his organisation\u0027s annual NHS Expo in Manchester. Those not paying their share were abdicating their responsibilities towards people harmed by betting, he added.Stevens urged the Premier League, which runs England\u0027s elite football competition, to step in and advise firms which are not paying into the fund to rethink their stance and start doing so.“There is an increasing link between problem gambling and stress, depression and other mental health problems,” he said. “Doctors report that two-thirds of problem gamblers get worse without help, and the NHS does offer specialist treatment.“But reports that foreign gambling companies are failing to play their part in co-funding help for addicts are deeply concerning. Taxpayers and the NHS should not be left to pick up the pieces. The health of the nation is everyone’s responsibility.”He told his audience of NHS staff and bosses that while the service had recently opened in London its first clinic dedicated to treatment of gambling addicts, some firms were not contributing towards the £10m which is meant to be raised to fund the work of the charity GambleAware.Gambling Commission rules oblige firms to help pay for its activities.NHS England plans to work with the Premier League “on how we persuade these foreign gambling companies to do the right thing,” he added.A spokesman said: “With nearly half the clubs in the Premier League, and over two-thirds of the Championship sponsored by gambling companies, we are seriously concerned the relationship between sport and gambling has reached a tipping point.“There is a real risk gambling advertising and sponsorships are normalising gambling for children. We welcome the call from NHS England for gambling companies, wherever they are based, to contribute more to treating problem gambling.”The Remote Gambling Association, which represents online betting firms, said it backed the principle of a levy on companies to help fund efforts to reduce addiction.“The RGA agrees that more funding is needed if the gambling industry as a whole is to fulfil its responsibilities to everyone in this country who gambles, and especially those who are affected by problem gambling,” it said in a statement.“To this end we have long supported a statutory levy to ensure the correct level of funds are raised in a fair and open process and, most importantly, that they are allocated in a way that is transparent, independent, and achieves measurable benefits.”Tom Watson, the shadow culture and sport secretary, said: “Britain is suffering from a hidden epidemic of gambling addiction and it’s the NHS and communities picking up the bill.\u0026nbspFootball fans in particular are bombarded with gambling advertising.\u0026nbsp“Nearly half of Premier League clubs have a gambling sponsor … Labour would ban sponsorship of Premier League teams by gambling companies and introduce a compulsory contribution to make the industry pay for the treatment of gambling addiction.”Foreign-owned betting firms that sponsor Premier League teams include Fun88, who sponsor Newcastle United, Everton’s sponsors SportPesa and M88, who have a deal with Bournemouth.

Eyebrows were also raised because the 38-year-old opted not to play in European Tour events leading up to both the conclusion of the automatic qualifying process and Bjørn announcing his captain’s choices.Bjørn has admitted García’s off-course influence was the defining factor five rookies had earlier claimed automatic berths for Europe. The Dane clearly regards that as a risk if not offset by Ryder Cup specialism. García has represented Europe eight times before, winning 22.5 points.“I can’t pinpoint what a European Team room is,” Bjørn said. “I can’t tell you exactly what it is that makes it great but one thing I know is: Sergio is right at the centre of it, every single time. He makes that team so much better.“So he has so many qualities, not just as a player, because he is a world-class player. I also think that this is going to make everybody else around him, around the team, better. You need to make the team work. You need to make that environment correct for everybody and he is right at the centre of doing that.“We need people that can rise to the occasion, that can up their game and that can make the man standing next to him better. Sergio does that. He’s the one that stands up and gives a speech to the others and he has done that in the past. He’s the one that stands up on Thursday night and rallies the troops. He’s also the one that on Saturday night, when you’re four points ahead, that goes ‘OK, this is by no means won yet’, because he knows that. He’s been there.”When pressed on whether García would have been picked virtually regardless of inidual results, Bjørn replied: “I felt like I had to go a long, long way to leave him out in my mind. I wanted him there.”Europe’s captain did, though, accept reasoning attached to widespread scepticism. “In sport people tend to go with just performance and that’s so easy to measure,” he added. “So that would be from the outside. I understand that’s the way people look at it but when you sit in my role … Padraig Harrington puts it best, he always says: ‘It’s not about picking the best players, it’s about picking the best team.’ And that’s what the picks are for.“It is so much more big than you could ever imagine. You need experience around you, and not just during those days that you are there, but from now until then.”Bjørn did not hide from the fact his call to Cabrera-Bello was by far the trickiest of six he made to unsuccessful players on Tuesday. Cabrera-Bello not only performed admirably in the 2016 Ryder Cup loss but survived for the weekend of each major this year. The 34-year-old, who is a place above García in the world rankings, finished in a share of seventh at last weekend’s Dell Technologies Championship in Boston.“Rafa, that was hard for him to understand,” Bjørn said. “It was hard for him to take in. It’s such a privilege to be Ryder Cup captain but any great job in the world also comes with some really tough decisions. That is not something I envy anybody having to do in the future. I felt sick to my stomach because I think the world of the bloke, I really do.”The United States team is odds-on to retain the trophy at Le Golf National. High-profile successes are key to that, with the combined tally of major wins sitting at 31 against eight in favour of the team captained by Jim Furyk.Poulter was amongst the first to cite García’s selection as logical. “He brings an incredible amount of experience,” explained the Englishman. “He brings a lot of points and an incredible amount of passion to the team. There are five rookies and it’s hard to explain to the rookies how they are going to feel and how big a stage the Ryder Cup really is. So you definitely need players like Sergio in the team who can help these guys to be able to feel comfortable.“The Ryder Cup is extremely different to normal regulation stroke play, even to other team events. Sergio is there for his experience, his passion, his drive, his motivation, and he’s there for a reason. Everybody that made the team are extremely hungry players. I think we are up for the challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d508db94efbd5f51e294e5ab8c6f44b1cf5924/0_0_2462_1477/master/2462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73a6ff82b90ed0ff8d5f35a007078b3","title":"diy sos grenfell boxing club review biggest most important build yet dale youth","story":"Nick Knowles and co joined forces with construction experts, volunteers and a future king to create a new home for Dale Youth, the gym that was destroyed in the tower fireThis column wouldn’t normally bother itself with DIY SOS (BBC One), an old makeover format. But this one is a bit different. And bigger. Bigger even than anything in the show’s later Big Build incarnation. In truth, it doesn’t have anything to do with DIY. Got any plans for the weekend? Yeah, I thought I might do a bit of major construction …The SOS part still works, though. Remember the Dale Youth boxing club, the gym that was housed on the second floor of Grenfell Tower – an integral part of the community, a place to keep young people out of trouble, a breeding ground for future stars of the ring? Since the tragedy, it has been operating out of a cold car park, a space it has shared with drunks and pigeons.Not good news for trainer Mick, a lovely man who has been the driving force behind Dale Youth for 45 years. Or for Mick’s sidekick, Gary. Or for eloquent young boxer Jodie, who lost a close friend in the fire. Or all the other people who use the gym and who lost people.So, Nick Knowles and his team are helping make a new premises under the Westway flyover. It will be their biggest, most important build yet, a “knockout boxing gym”. See what you did there, Nick.We are not talking the usual loft conversion here: a bit of brickwork, roof battens, tiling this has architects, big construction firms and proper experts donating skills and materials for free.When they have done their bit, though, the volunteers can come in and do theirs. Like a manwho has come all the way from Sunderland to help out. And William, from up the road in a neighbouring borough.William is a painter and decorator. He arrives in a white van, the Sun on his dashboard, window down, honking and wolf-whistling ... Actually, he isn’t and he doesn’t – he arrives in a black Jaguar with a police escort, because he is that William, the future king. He says all the right things, about the community coming together. “Is one of you an uppercut man and one of you a jabber, is that how it works?” he asks Mick and Gary.William meets Jodie. “Jodie, how you going?” he says. (Interesting – on the street, it is usually “How are you doing?” or “How’s it going?”, if you are reading, your royal highness – and I know you do). He has a few nice words for Jodie, about dealing with losing someone, about the need to keep talking, as well as boxing. There is a little banter, verbal sparring with Nick, too.William loves DIY SOS he went on it before with his brother, doing up houses in Manchester for former services personnel. Now he is getting involved in his overalls and hard hat, with a roller. The paint looks a little thick to be going on fresh plaster should he not be doing a mist coat first? Hey, he is not bad at this, much better than his dad or his grandad at mixing with the hoi polloi well done.Well done to everyone. Dale Youth has a brilliant new home, completed in just 63 days. It is beautiful: knockout indeed. Mick and Gary say it makes them feel 25 again Jodie says it is outstanding. Everyone is a little bit choked up. It is Grenfell – it is impossible not to be.The Extreme Diet Hotel (Channel 4) in Sussex is run by a Russian woman called Galia who has a zero-tolerance approach to weight loss, old-fashioned ideas about why someone may want to lose weight and a good understanding of how this kind of television works.“You can’t fit into your clothes, you’re unhappy person, you can’t find the man because you’re unhappy, no one wants to deal with you any more go lose weight, you bitch,” she tells ... well, the camera, I think. I think it is mostly for the camera.It seems to be working for Kirstie, though, who needs to drop two sizes to get into her wedding dress. After a spat with Galia over food, tears and the inevitable threat to walk out, Kirsty runs 5K at the end of her (£1,400) week. Will she see the results on the scales? “That will be the icing on the cake,’’ says Galia, cruelly, given that all she serves is vegetables and hot water.Kirsty does lose the weight, the dress just about goes on – more tears. Hopefully, at the wedding, there will be a real cake. And icing.

Works 20 hours a week“Working a second job, and the lack of rest that comes with that, makes it really hard to do the most important thing that a teacher does: remain engaged and enthusiastic, and really be the driving force in a classroom. The second challenge is that every year, students come to me with ideas for organizations they would like to start, clubs they would like to be involved in, and some of those things match up really well with some of my own passions.“But when I weigh the additional amount of money that I need for my second job against my inclination, it doesn’t make sense.“When you consider a teacher with zero experience versus a teacher like me with now 11 years behind me, there’s only a $3,619 difference in our salary. That signals to me that our district does not value experienced teachers. If I didn’t work a second job, I would be a risk for not having funds to deal with major financial problems that could occur in anyone’s life, whether that’s a major medical expense, a major car expense, or a family emergency.”Full-time job Middle school social studies teacher.

It’s really hard to think about my own livelihood in the midst of trying to teach 115 teenagers. I should only have to care about their development, but I also have in my head, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to pay this month’s rent.’ I absolutely love what I do and I want to continue doing this and I don’t want to do anything else, but I can’t keep living with my parents to save money.“I see November as a pivotal moment for my future. The last increase we really saw in raises and school funding has been 20-odd years, and if it’s going to be that rate again, at the current rate of inflation, I will be living in poverty.

I use my lunch breaks often times to make choreography or to make lessons for that evening. Sometimes that’s what my weekends are devoted to also. Social life? What’s that? And sometimes even my personal health is at risk. It’s hard to eat lunch when you’ve got so many different things going on.“There’s times where I have to talk to myself in the mirror and tell myself: ‘It’s OK, you can get through this. I know you’re exhausted, but it’ll be all right.’ And I get my second wind eventually. I get that adrenaline boost that I need to keep teaching. But there are times when I’m just so tired and my body is making me think that it can’t take it any more.”“I try and leave school a little bit earlier than normal when I’m working just so I can have some extra time. When I go home I have to take care of my dogs first: I have to change clothes and I have to eat dinner because I don’t get home from PetSmart until 9.30pm and I’m not eating dinner at 9.30 at night. The hardest part is just managing stress.“The reason I took a second job is that I have some debt that I’m trying to pay off. I needed the extra money to pay my bills. I was struggling with just the teaching income and this makes it so that I don’t have to struggle financially. I can live on my wage, but I’m single and have no kids. There’s a lot of teachers who are single parents who are really struggling.”“We use the envelope system a little bit. This week’s softball lesson would go into an envelope for the tire fund. Or this week’s lesson, half of it would go for car maintenance.“I will probably continue my side jobs through at least my kids going to college. We’ve accumulated some debt over the years, because when you need tires, you just put down the credit card. When the washing machine goes out, you put it on the credit card. We’re going to be catching up from that for years. I’ve got a car that’s pushing 200,000 miles and another car that’s pushing 100,000 and we’ve got a girl going off to college next year. We haven’t contributed to our IRAs in about three years, maybe even longer than that.”“The teacher shouldn’t have to drive a bus. I don’t get to stay after school to help my students for even five minutes if they have a question. Sometimes I feel like I’m letting my students down because I have to go directly to my bus.

In a flurry of tweets last week the president claimed that Google’s news service was “rigged” against him. Google denied that search results were politically biased. The White House subsequently said it was “taking a look” at whether, and how, Google should be regulated by the government.The justice department’s comments indicate further scrutiny of the tech giant’s control of the information ecosystem.“The Attorney General has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms,” said spokesman Devin O’Malley in a statement.Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the DoJ’s statement. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“It’s totally perplexing,” said Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, reacting to the announcement. “If there’s no allegation of a crime by the social media companies it’s hard to understand the basis of a DoJ investigation.”That was not to say that the role social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube play in shaping public discourse should no’t be scrutinised by researchers and congressional committees, Abdo said.“The companies’ platforms are now the single most important forum for speech in our society,” said Abdo. “That’s why it is incredibly important for the public to understand how precisely the companies’ machine-learning algorithms shape what we see online and who we engage with online.”Conservatives have accused Silicon Valley’s technology giants of favouring progressive ideas for several years. A critical inflection point came in May 2016 when people hired to populate Facebook’s “trending news” team told Gizmodo that they routinely suppressed conservative news sites – something Facebook vehemently denied.More recently the platforms have clamped down on conspiracy theories and hate speech, which culminated in the removal of the alt-right blogger Alex Jones from Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and Apple Podcasts.At the time, Jones said: “The more I’m persecuted, the stronger I get.” However, that turned out to be inaccurate. According to a New York Times investigation, the bans have cut traffic to Jones’ Infowars site in half – from about 1.4m daily visits to just 715,000.Despite the growing backlash from the right, there’s no strong evidence to suggest systemic bias against conservatives on social media. Twitter, Facebook and Google deny political bias, but they are all private companies with their own terms of service. They have always censored speech to attract advertisers and prevent harm against users, whether it’s pictures of female nipples, bullying and harassment, or terrorist propaganda.Jones was banned from Facebook not for his political views but for glorifying violence and using dehumanising language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.One of the problems is the historical lack of transparency over these private companies’ sorting algorithms and content moderation decisions.“In the absence of substantive explanations, users have been left to wonder why search results look the way they do, or why some posts get removed and others don\u0027t,” wrote Tarleton Gillespie in Techdirt. “This uncertainty breeds suspicion, and that suspicion goes looking for other explanations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dca9ebc328d767971044db8adcedc3d92f570042/232_268_2564_1538/master/2564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a0284f3f11ff674aa59302030aa465","title":"roy moore sues sacha baron cohen for 95m over who is america stunt","story":"One-time Senate candidate says he was falsely portrayed as a paedophile in lawsuit against CBS and ShowtimeThe failed US Senate candidate Roy Moore has sued the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen for defamation and emotional distress after being pranked on the actor’s television show.The lawsuit asks for $95m in punitive and compensatory damages and appears to be the first filed by one of the string of politicians who were duped and humiliated by Baron Cohen on the show Who is America.The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in federal court in Washington DC, accuses Baron Cohen of defaming Moore and says Moore suffered extreme emotional distress as a result of being falsely portrayed as a sex offender and paedophile on the show. Moore was duped into appearing on a segment where Baron Cohen demonstrated a supposed paedophile detecting device that beeped when it came near Moore.During last year’s Senate race Moore faced accusations he pursued romantic and sexual relationships with children as young as 14 when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. He has denied the misconduct allegations.Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative group Freedom Watch, is representing Moore and his wife Kayla in the lawsuit. The complaint also names CBS and Showtime as defendants in the case.Klayman said in a statement: “Sasha Baron Cohen, who is not only low class but also a fraudster, will now, along with Showtime and CBS, be held accountable for his outrageous and false, fraudulent and defamatory conduct which callously did great emotional and other damage to his great man and his wife and family.”Representatives of Baron Cohen did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit.A Showtime representative wrote in an email that the company did not comment on pending litigation, and to their knowledge it had not been served with the complaint.Klayman said Moore thought he was receiving an award for supporting Israel when he agreed to appear on the show. In the segment Baron Cohen appeared as the bushy-eyebrowed faux counter-terrorism instructor “Colonel Erran Morad” discussing bogus military technology, including a supposed paedophile detector. The device repeatedly beeped as it got near Moore, who sat stone-faced.Baron Cohen’s latest show, which began airing in July, has drawn in several other political figures. In one episode the former Arizona sheriff and Senate candidate Joe Arpaio argued the benefits of gun ownership to a tiny toy doughnut.Another episode led a Georgia state representative to resign after he shouted racial slurs and exposed his rear end in a supposed anti-terrorism self-defence drill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78a0c503f2b9c58860e36dc06828f6d636f56d9/0_1_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9eea52c83621ccf024d48d6ea23148c","title":"ditching the nine to five modern men are looking for more purpose","story":"Men are no longer the sole breadwinners of decades past. Now they’re flexi-workers, portfolio parents, paternity-leave takers … What effect has that had on masculinity? John Perry investigatesWhen I was at primary school, we had an assembly entitled “What my daddy does”. There was a newsagent dad (this was met with applause – we all liked the Beano), a pub landlord dad (more applause, some cheers from the teachers) and the dad who drove an ice-cream van (whooping, major jealousy). Then I stood up. “My daddy makes drugs,” I said.Obviously, in 2018, such a revelation would trigger immediate calls to social services and a hovering police chopper searching for our Breaking Bad-style meth lab. But this was 1980s Macclesfield. Most of the dads on our estate worked at the ICI pharmaceuticals plant, the biggest employer in town. Back then everyone was peddling drugs.Fast-forward a generation to an assembly on the same topic at my son’s school. How things have changed. First, no one was smoking. Second, the jobs were much more erse. In fact, many – personal trainer, web designer, IT consultant – hadn’t even been invented in the 80s. One dad was even a nurse. My old man would have choked on his B\u0026ampH.But the biggest difference? Some men actually seemed to enjoy what they did. “I teach coding to kids,” said one. “It’s so rewarding.”“It’s the biggest economic change in the past generation,” says Barbara Petrongolo, professor of economics at Queen Mary, University of London. “Traditional male sectors like manufacturing have been shrinking in all high-income countries,” she says. “And that, of course, has consequences for gender roles.”The days of a job for life, in the mill or the mine, are gone. Now men work part-time, they start online businesses, they adapt to fast-moving markets. Take my friend Dave. Made redundant when his double-glazing firm moved to Asia, Dave started selling home offices, or “posh sheds”, as he puts it. “I looked around and so many people wanted to work from home,” he says. “The timing was perfect.”And, even though job insecurity and a rollercoaster cashflow are the inevitable downsides of being your own boss, it does have one huge advantage: the work-life balance. A quarter of a million men are now looking after children full-time, and, says Petrongolo, “the social expectation is that the majority of nine-to-fivers spend their weekends with family rather than golfing or down the pub”.Men are also shifting the work-life balance when the “work” part doesn’t tick every box. Men such as lawyer William Lynds who downsized from a high-pressure job to spend three days a week working in law and the rest teaching meditation and developing his fashion line Xavier Athletica.“It used to be: you’re a butcher, a baker or a candlestick-maker,” he says. “Now people are looking at work not just as a bread-on-the-table thing, but also as a way to define who they are.”So how do we define ourselves as men in 2018? Petrongolo thinks masculinity is on a parallel path with the current movement of women challenging outdated “rules” such as the gender pay gap.“Education leads to more aspiration among women,” she says, “and along with exposure to female leaders, the perception of the female role changes. And when the female role changes, the perception of the male role changes too.”For our father’s generation, this could have led to a crisis, but men in 2018 are seeing it as an opportunity a chance to duck old-fashioned expectations and find a new, better way to live, while still holding on to the best parts of being a man.“It’s a very male thing to take responsibility,” says Lynds, “to make a change and be accountable is a very positive use of masculinity. I think modern men are looking for more purpose, for something more authentic and honest.”Plus, it takes courage and resilience – often perceived as traditional male traits – to dump that safe-but-suffocating job in insurance to become a ing instructor or even a shed salesman.And we can learn from women too. Since Emmeline Pankhurst began campaigning for equal rights, women have asked: “Why not us? Why can’t we be doctors or lawyers or pilots?” Finally, men have begun to question gender stereotypes: “Why shouldn’t I be a dietitian or a nursery nurse or a full-time dad – or all three?” And that, surely, is the best example to set for the next generation.Philips wants to encourage men to follow their instincts and do what feels right – whether it’s the job they do or a grooming routine that works for them.

The buzzword? “Kind”.I know what you’re thinking – we’ve been told to be kind to each other for years. Everyone from Aristotle to Princess Diana has extolled its virtues as Mark Twain said: “Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”But the current iteration is different to the previous “pay it forward” variety. The new kindness is about putting yourself first – being “kindful”, in the same way you would be “mindful” in your day-to-day life. Why? Because if you’re not kind to yourself, how will you ever be kind to others?As with any new idea from the wellbeing world, some people have trouble getting on board. And I’ve noticed that kindfulness is a concept men especially can struggle with. After all, for decades guys were told to “man up” and encouraged to repress their feelings. Anything else was unmanly. It left generations unable to articulate their troubles at all.But with our mental health now a headline issue, 2018 feels like the tipping point – the moment when men say: “Enough is enough.”Matt Coyne, author of bestselling parenting guide Dummy: The Comedy and Chaos of Real-life Parenting, agrees. “Growing up, I was left in no doubt that a ‘real man’ should be tough, uncompromising and too busy eating red meat and reverse-parking efficiently to have feelings.“I’m not what anyone would describe as a ‘man’s man’. I like musicals, I struggle to grow a beard and I once cried watching Pitch Perfect 2. Being a stay-at-home dad isn’t for everyone, but I can definitely say that I feel fulfilled by it.”Coyne is an advocate of kindfulness in his own unique way. “I’m not someone who goes in for that whole standing in front of a mirror and shouting: ‘I’m a tiger!’” he says. “I’d feel like a bit of an idiot. But I constantly ask myself: ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’“Ditching parenting guilt has been a huge part of becoming a happier dad. It took me a while to work out that I will always be a bad parent – according to somebody. The greatest kindness parents can do themselves is realise that the only opinion that matters is your kid’s. As long as I’m the greatest dad to one person – my son – that’s good enough.”But while Coyne has happily shrugged off the stereotypes of what it means “to be a man”, many others are still struggling under the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with attempting to be a doting dad, ambitious career man, loyal partner or perfect provider.The ManKind Project was formed in 1998 so men could get together and talk about the fact that society’s expectations of men are “based on power, control and invincibility”. It sets out a clear mission statement: to allow a man to live with confidence, and purpose, and create a life without fear for himself and those around him. In short – to learn to be kind to themselves each day.Experts agree that a seemingly small thing, such as altering a negative internal monologue, can have a significant impact. Steve Clarke is a leading psychotherapist at Priory’s Life Works residential rehabilitation centre in Woking, Surrey. He says that negative self-talk can be so ingrained that it makes men feel – perversely – as though they’re on the right track. He explains: “Many men believe they can identify a self-critical voice as that of a once-critical parent, partner or coach who used criticism as a way to motivate or punish.“An increase in male body dysmorphia, poor physical health due to neglect among some, poor work-life balance and financial woes can all lead to a negative self-image,” Clarke adds.“It’s important to take a step back and recognise your value. Ask some people you respect to describe your best qualities. It’s good to be reminded of our strengths, and it helps to improve self-esteem.”According to Clarke, other acts of kindfulness that can go a long way to achieving that much-craved sense of contentment include taking 10 minutes out of the day to spend by yourself. “Use this time to remind yourself that you have the simple things in life – food in your belly, a roof over your head, money in your pocket, running water, love, compassion and good health. You’ll feel rich beyond all measure,” he says.So what other kindful acts can you bring into your life? How about a rethink of your relationship with your mobile phone? Even workaholic Simon Cowell has gone phone-free. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” the music mogul revealed this year. “I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused. It has been so good for my mental health. It really is good for you and it has absolutely made me happier.”Psychotherapist Padraig O’Morain, who has also written a book on kindfulness, believes that this form of self-care can transform anyone’s life for the better. “People who practise self-compassion are good at taking on challenges … it is often our own condemnation that we most fear,” he says.But how easy is it to apply kindfulness to your own life? Writer Chris Brock was experiencing crippling anxiety when he had a self-care epiphany.“I suffered with anxiety to the point where my head was constantly buzzing with negative thoughts: that I was a failure, I wasn’t good enough and maybe I’d be better off dead,” says Brock, who has just written a book about his experiences, Do the Thing, Have the Power: Overcome Self-Doubt and Build a Life You Love.“Someone said to me: ‘Thoughts aren’t fact’, but I struggled with this for about six months,” says Brock. “One day, those anxious voices were beating me up and I said out loud: ‘Shut up!’ It was at that moment that I realised that our thoughts are not us. And that led me on a road to meditation, mindfulness, and taking ownership of my life.”Brock put a programme of self-care into practice: drinking more water, starting a gratitude journal to focus on the positive in his life, and avoiding reading too much negative news.“This is a lifestyle change and something you need to practise every day,” he says. “I soon noticed the change in myself and became aware of how good I could feel.”“Negativity is just really hard work and energy-sapping so I really like the idea of kindfulness as a kind of counterbalance,” Coyne adds. “I really think there’s something to it for men.”Caroline Millington is author of Kindfulness (£10, Head of Zeus) out on 4 October 2018Philips wants to encourage men to follow their instincts and do what feels right – whether it’s how they treat themselves or a grooming routine that works for them.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said at the time that Paraguay, the third country after the United States and Guatemala to make the move, had taken a “bold stance in international affairs”.However, Paraguay’s new president, Mario Abdo Benítez, who took office last month, reviewed the choice and his foreign minister told reporters on Wednesday that the decision had been changed.“Paraguay wants to contribute to an intensification of regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a broad, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East,” Luis Alberto Castiglioni said.Shortly after, Netanyahu’s office responded by saying it will close its Paraguay embassy and recall its ambassador for consultations. “Israel views with great severity the unusual decision by Paraguay that will strain the ties between the countries,” a brief statement said.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, had previously called for Latin American countries not to move their embassies. His foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, pushed the freshly installed Paraguay administration to reverse its decision, according to a statement from his office which announced “a new Palestinian diplomatic achievement”.“Minister Maliki exerted a big effort during his meeting with the new president who instructed his foreign minister to arrange the issue,” the ministry said.Trump’s decision broke decades of international consensus that recognition for one side or the other would kill already-moribund efforts at achieving a deal. Jerusalem has been a fundamental issue that has stalled previous negotiations, but Trump has said it is now “off the table”.Diplomats had warned that the December announcement could see a return to violence in the region. On the day Washington’s embassy was opened in Jerusalem – attended by Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner – Israeli forces shot and killed 58 Palestinians protesting against the event.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4ffbf16ccf9d10ed9ad5080619bf56f0242ebe/0_196_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8279021975de73d19394919b06d15115","title":"turkey sea turtles conservation work iztuzu beach in pictures","story":"Turkey’s Iztuzu beach is witnessing a major construction boom.

In the next few months he will face the resolution of two issues that will define at least this phase of his political career.The business end of Brexit will demand decisions and judgments, some of them perhaps made in the small hours of a European summit, that will have far-reaching consequences for himself, his Government and the country.The question of how and when the Government he inherited comes to an end must also be faced.It’s that second question that is uppermost in the minds of the Fine Gael TDs and Senators who meet in Galway today for the parliamentary party’s autumn think-in. Above everything else, they want to know if there’s going to be an election. What will he tell them?However, Varadkar is clear that he will not be sending his TDs over the top immediately. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has – as Varadkar knew he would – rebuffed his approaches for an early renewal of the confidence-and-supply agreement. The question was always what the Taoiseach would do then. The answer seems to be: nothing, for now. “I’m not going to call an election,” he says.He rehearses the arguments for an early renewal of the confidence-and-supply agreement one more time.“I don’t want to be in a situation where I don’t know how long the Government is going to last, where I don’t know whether the Government will last more than a few weeks after the budget is passed, or more than a day after the Finance Bill is passed,” he says.“I think that’s not in the interests of the country, I think it weakens our position when it comes to the Brexit talks.“When you attend meetings in Brussels, one thing anybody wonders is: ‘What’s the longevity of that prime minister?’ You know, we all know, for example, there are elections coming up in Sweden, we all know there are elections coming up in Luxembourg. People inevitably want to know is this the person you’re going to be dealing with in six months’ time or nine months’ time – so I think it puts us in a weaker position when we don’t have certainty around that.“And then also when it comes to negotiating contracts, when it comes to trying to negotiate agreements with interest groups and so on, I think the Government is in a much better position to deliver for the taxpayer if people know that that government is going to be around and be able to honour those deals.”This is thin enough reasoning. All governments are bound by the agreements made by their predecessors. The state has an eternal legal personality. Of course a new government can change the policy of an old one. But it can’t tear up legal agreements without legal consequences. The government does not have a legal personality the state does, and it is a perpetual one.In the European Union, governments change all the time prime ministers come and go. But national interests remain. Varadkar likes the high politics of European summits, and he may well be good at it. But he may also be overestimating the importance of the personal chemistry around the table with the other heads of government. Leadership matters of course it does. But other things matter too, such as a country’s permanent interests. And anyway, whatever criticisms Martin has of Varadkar’s handling of Brexit, his policy would be little different.Either way, Martin seems likely to simply wait Varadkar out. He isn’t going to start negotiations until after the budget, and the landscape for, and range of potential outcomes of, those talks will be defined by the resolution of the Brexit talks. Is there an agreement or isn’t there? Is the prognosis catastrophic, or merely bad?Varadkar repeats again and again that he wants to settle the future of the Government (in his favour, naturally) now. “But ultimately, if Fianna Fáil isn’t willing to do that, they’re not.”Negotiations have begun between the two parties though – yesterday – on the budget. The room for manoeuvre is slim enough, though – not because the budget is not expansionary (it is) but because much of the available increase in spending has already been committed, in capital spending pledges, in the costs of demographic changes, in public sector pay rises.“We did that eyes open,” Varadkar says, “knowing full well that budgets would be less dramatic than they had been in previous years. But I think it’s what you actually need.“We have limited room for manoeuvre and for big announcements on budget day – roughly €800 million, and the vast majority of that will be taken up by the welfare package and the tax package.“But I really think that’s the way we need to go into the future – these massive, dramatic budgets where there are big announcements on budget day . . . is not actually the way to solve the problems that we have in health and housing. Actually what we need is long-term planning and consistent investment.”Housing, the single greatest area of political attack on the Government, will be a particular focus. But against the political need for “something to be done” is Varadkar’s belief that there “aren’t any overnight solutions”.The long-term planning and incremental progress that he lauds has an uncomfortable corollary for politicians: problems will be fixed slowly. And with the numbers of people in emergency accommodation heading inexorably for 10,000 the demand for solutions is going to get louder. But Varadkar is keen to come to the defence of his Minister for Housing – and key political ally – Eoghan Murphy.People focusing on Murphy personally “on how he looks or how he speaks or what he wears . . . are really not people who care about people who are homeless or care about housing. They are just people who are trying to score political points or gain political advantage,” Varadkar says.Rather than focusing on the person of the Minister, he says, they should look at the “role of local authorities”.“Ultimately the responsibility for providing social housing actually lies with local authorities – that’s why we call them council houses. That’s why we call them council estates. At the very least it’s a shared responsibility between central government and local authorities. And if you look at some of the local authorities where the housing shortage is at its worst, they’re local authorities like Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council – on which Sinn Féin is the largest party and left-wing groups dominate.”If the council wants to spend more money in housing, it can ert money from other areas, he says, or it can increase commercial rates, or raise the property tax. “It’s a tough decision to make, but they can make it.”On Brexit, Varadkar seeks to play his part in what EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier calls “de-dramatising” the issue of the Border backstop, the contentious guarantee that there will be no hard border, even if the EU and the UK fail to agree a trade deal.But does he accept any responsibility for dramatising it in the first place?“No, is the short answer.”“We do need to have a backstop. We need to make sure that it avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But I think it can be de-dramatised in two ways. I think we should totally move away from any sort of language about there being a border in the Irish Sea – that is not what is intended, sought or asked for by the Irish Government. ”There are checks, he says, that occur already – “between Northern Ireland and Ireland around diesel, and excise, and tax, for example. There are checks that occur between Britain and Northern Ireland around agriculture and phytosanitary and so on . . . It’s not an attempt to create some sort of new political border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain – that’s not what we were ever looking for.”He has, he says, been trying to agree a date for a meeting with Arlene Foster – “but we haven’t been able to agree a date”. There seems little urgency on either side. He hasn’t spoken to Foster “for a couple of months”.He does say that he thinks it is becoming “increasingly evident that a hard Brexit might actually undermine the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. I think more and more unionists are perhaps starting to come around to that view. But it’s not for me tell them their own business.”“The best thing we can do to get things back on track in Northern Ireland is to have greater clarity on what Brexit is going to look like,” Varadkar says. “I think that is going to be the focus for the next couple of weeks.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3619542.1536167110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spatial tests could reveal early sign of alzheimer s says expert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNobel Prize winner Prof John O’Keefe’s  tells forum  that his team of scientists are “trying to come up with simple spatial memory tests, which will allow us detect people who are at the early stages of the disease”. File photograph: Getty ImagesSimple tests of spatial awareness could allow clinicians to spot early indications of Alzheimer’s disease, Nobel Prize winner Prof John O’Keefe told the Schrödinger at 75 conference. Early detection was critical for treating this disease, since Alzheimer’s is now believed to start decades before patients are diagnosed, he added. Prof O’Keefe, a neuroscientist at the University College London (UCL), is reknowned for discovering “place cells” in the brain. These cells start firing off signals once we are in a particular place. For a lab rat roaming around a box, a place cell only becomes active in a small patch of the box, then turns off when it leaves. It was subsequently discovered that the brain also has cells that signal which direction an animal is facing, he said.Teamwork between such cells allow us build a mental picture of, for example, a new city we visit, he explained. “The idea of a place is an abstract concept that is created by the mind itself,” said Prof O’Keeffe. Spatial awareness could be key to revealing early Alzheimer’s, he said. His team had been “trying to come up with simple spatial memory tests, which will allow us detect people who are at the early stages of the disease”, he told the conference. The “four mountains test” was one such assessment. A person is shown four mountains, which vary in height and shape. They are then asked to recognise the mountains again – from another perspective. “It turns out that patients with damage to their hippocampus are very bad at this test,” added Prof O’Keefe.“This part of the brain which we have been studying for many years actually is one of the first parts that becomes disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease,” he says. “We will be able to use that knowledge and also to construct tests which are going to identify people who are at the earliest stages of the disease and suitable for therapy.” Prof O’Keefe shared the Nobel Prize for physiology or Medicine in 2014 for his research on neural processes involved in mental representation of the spatial environments. He was born in New York to Irish parents and has been based at UCL since 1967.He also outlined about how billions of cells manage to create just one consciousness, and the riddle of how the delay of information we receive from the external environment, through sight and sound for example, match up with our internal knowledge. Unified consciousness is all about good timing, he explained.“We believe the real world is out there, but it is a construct of the mind,” he said. “Even when remembering from the past or looking into the future, we view from the present. Why should this be so?” Some of the most important questions in brain research still surround the schism “between mind and brain”, he said.The complexity of the brain was addressed by US physicist Prof Danielle Bassett from the University of Pennsylvania, who uses tools from “network science” and complex mathematical approaches to study neurons. “Instead of thinking about brain regions, we now must think about it as a vast network,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3619470.1536164758!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the mammoths return scientist predicts de extinction of long lost animals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIf cloning a mammoth was to become possible, a living cell would be necessary “to jump-start cellular specialisation and development”, Prof Beth Shapiro told the Schrodinger at 75 conference in Dublin.It is not yet possible to clone a mammoth and bring it back to life but the use of advanced genetic techniques will make it possible to achieve “de-extinction” of species across the world, evolutionary biologist Prof Beth Shapiro has predicted.While extinction has always happened, it is now occurring at 22 times above the normal rate as the world enters its “sixth extinction period”, due to human effects on the environment, she warned.Addressing the Schrödinger at 75 conference in Dublin, Prof Shapiro said there had been a 50 per cent decline of species during a relatively-short period - while 41,000 species were currently on the endangered list.However, it was possible to slow down extinction through conservation and preservation of habitats. Further progress was being made by “genetic rescue” through identifying threatened populations, and then deploying what are known as “de-extinction” strategies.This combination of approaches was helping to arrest the decline of pumas, mountain lions and panthers in North and South America. Using radio-tracking of animals and genomic sequencing it was possible to identify isolated populations in decline due to the effects of inbreeding and then to reconstruct their “evolutionary history”. Genetic technology was also very useful, for example, where there was only one population of a species left in the world, as was the case with black-footed ferrets in the US, she said. By looking at the genome of an extinct population, preserved by freezing of samples, it was possible to identify genetic differences and to “insert ersity” back into animals - and to increase their chances of survival. It was also possible to identify “cousins” – ie, related species – that were resistant to disease such as plague. This raised the distinct possibility of identifying genes that confer disease resistance and introducing them into the ferret’s genome. Gene modification technology had helped the American chestnut tree resist blight using wheat genes, she said. This life-sustaining technology may soon help coral reefs threatened by global warming take on “heat resistance” abilities.If cloning a mammoth was to become possible, a living cell would be necessary “to jump-start cellular specialisation and development”, Prof Shapiro said. If that was somehow realisable the big issue then would be where to place “de-extinct” species on the planet. The global focus should instead be on endangered species, she believed. There were risks in using “genomics and scary biotech” but they were worth taking if they worked in changing many reports of species extinction to one good story of “de-extinction”.

Photograph: Fredrik Persson Sweden OutEPAOn a sunny September afternoon in Stockholm, people stroll along the Strandvägen waterfront on a Lou Reed-certified perfect day.Were it not for the anti-Nazi demonstration on the square named after Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who lost his life saving Hungarian Jews in the Holocaust.Seven decades after he disappeared, and days before Swedes elect a new government, what would one of their national heroes make of the sign reading “No Space For Nazis”?It is a question that student couple Charlotte and Lars are asking themselves, too. “It’s insane that we have to be here, protesting against Nazis,” says Charlotte, looking a little embarrassed in the huge crowd of all ages. “But we were all caught out last weekend, and felt we had to show our face today.”A week previously, more than 200 supporters of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement staged a six-hour rally in Stockholm, chanting slogans and waving the organisation’s green-and-white flags.Their march, protected by Swedish police, attracted about 200 counter-demonstrators. An animal rights march at the same time in the capital attracted 500 people. Shocked, thousands of Swedes have gathered a week later here in the dying days of an election campaign dominated by extreme positions alien to most locals.Taking to the stage at the anti-Nazi demonstration is Livia Fränkel, who survived Josef Mengele and Auschwitz. Her simple warning: beware the beginnings.“We ended up in Sweden where we started a new life and thought we had found security and happiness – and perhaps we have done so,” she said. “But that security has begun to sag, Nazis are once again marching through our streets. They’re spreading their evil again to finish what Hitler started, but we will not let them.”The crowd cheers, many with tears in their eyes. They are crying for her, and themselves.Burdening this prosperous Nordic country are problems familiar elsewhere in the world: immigration and globalisation, and the struggles of mainstream politicians to provide answers to both.The party claiming to have all the answers here is the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD). Founded 30 years ago by ex-Nazis, it is now growing exponentially: almost 6 per cent in the 2010 election, 12.9 per cent in 2014. Since the 2015-2016 refugee crisis, when Sweden took in more people per capita than any European country, the SD is nearing 20 per cent.Analysts say many Swedes will back the SD less out of conviction than frustration with the political mainstream and their struggle to tackle – even discuss – glaring problems that have risen in parallel with the influx of new arrivals.Around the corner from the anti-Nazi march is Stockholm’s great synagogue, built in 1870, with the Hebrew inscription on the facade: “And make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them.”Aron Verständig, chairman of the Jewish community in Sweden, says the refugee crisis catalysed pre-existing problems and has played into the hands of the political fringes.A watershed moment came last December, he says, when a Hanukkah party at a Gothenburg synagogue was interrupted by Molotov cocktails, thrown by two Palestinians and a Syrian, aged between 18 and 24.Also last December, at a Stockholm protest against the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, participants were heard promising to “shoot the Jews” while a speaker called Jews “apes and pigs”.In the northern Swedish city of Umea, a Jewish community centre closed last year after swastikas and messages daubed on its walls reading: “We know where you live.”For Sweden’s 18,000 strong Jewish community, particularly those outside the relative safety of Stockholm, these are times of concern. And yet, paradoxically, of hope.“Until last year’s attacks politicians here believed if you are an immigrant you are an underdog and can never be a racist, that the only racists are privileged white Swedish males,” said Verständig, Stockholm’s Jewish community chairman.No more: Social Democrat prime minister Stefan Löfven led the condemnations of that attack, conceding that he and others had been naive to the threat in their midst from immigrants raised in homelands where anti-Semitism is the norm.Importing that problem has activated Sweden’s immune system, forcing society here to confront realities that it chose not to see until now. That, in turn, has energised the battle against the latent, native anti-Semitism hiding behind the far-right Sweden Democrats’ carefully curated facade of respectability.In its latest scandal: a party MP has come under fire for a Facebook photo-montage of Anne Frank in a white hoodie, carrying the slogan: “Coolest Jew in the Shower Room.”“Swedes were very naive, but now they are less so,” suggested Verständig of Stockholm’s Jewish community. “This is still, by and large, a functioning and safe society, also for Jews. But the process of waking up – and growing up – is ongoing.”Part 1 of a series. Tomorrow: Immigration and the challenge of integration in Sweden.

Mr Raab was appearing before the Commons EU scrutiny committee after Brexiteer Conservatives claimed that EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, shared their enthusiasm for a Canada-style deal.“I think you need to accept the small print of the offer that is being made in relation to the appendage of the backstop the EU is proposing, which ultimately would involve a limbo period to be determined by the EU, which could proceed indefinitely,” Mr Raab said.Mr Raab was appearing before the committee alongside Theresa May’s top European affairs adviser, Olly Robbins, who faced hostile questioning from Brexiteers. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said that Mr Barnier had told MPs during a visit to Brussels this week that Theresa May’s Chequers proposals were dead in the water.When Mr Raab asked if those were Mr Barnier’s precise words, Mr Kinnock said he believed the phrase used was “les propositions sont mortes”.During prime minister’s questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Ms May that her Chequers proposal had already been ripped apart by her own party. The prime minister said the Chequers proposal remained a basis for negotiation with the EU and claimed it would fulfil the government’s promise to respect the Brexit referendum while protecting the economy and avoiding a hard border in Ireland.In Brussels on Wednesday Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said his party could not vote for a Canada-style free trade deal because it would not satisfy the criterion it has set out demanding that any deal should offer the same benefits as EU membership.“We have our six tests and it wouldn’t meet them, and I don’t think it would be approved by the Conservative Party because you have the other wing who would be concerned about the distance between a Canada deal from where we are now,” he said.“At the end, the central problem for the prime minister is always the same: she has a warring party behind her, and the two sides can’t agree sufficiently to allow her to get a deal through unless she goes for a customs union plus single market deal with shared regulations and institutions. That I think would have a majority in parliament.”Mr Starmer added: “Whatever the agreement – if there is one – it has to keep to the solemn commitment of no hard border with Northern Ireland. The only combination that will meet that commitment is a customs union with the EU and a single market deal with high alignment.”Mr Starmer said his concern was that he did not believe Ms May was strong enough to adapt her position without facing a challenge to her premiership.Labour has said it is keeping all options on the table, including that of a second referendum, should parliament fail to back any deal Ms May strikes with Brussels."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Paid more attention to the advert than I have been to #GBBO.Another said: Good luck topping that at Christmas without getting the actual Queen involved #nothingbeatsbohemianrhapsody.Janice Birch posted: Waitrose \u0026amp John Lewis advertisement!

Absolutely fantastic, was smiling all the way through it!

Really, I feared that none of you would really be able to compete with my incredibly snazzy dinner jacket,” he told the audience, explaining why he had eschewed the black tie dress code in favour of a double-breasted navy suit.“When I was first told of GQ magazine’s wish to give me a Man of the Year award I felt sure there must have been some kind of mistake and must be an ill-conceived fashion award - particularly as, in fashion terms, I am like a stopped clock.

The boy’s mother said she never received the letter revoking his passport. In an exclusive interview with the , Mohamed’s mother Hawa Keita, who is Guinean and based in Sheffield, told of her ordeal: “At the moment I am not really well because I am not with my son because I really miss him. I just want to see him. It is nearly schooltime and I want him to go there with his friends. Any mother would understand the stress this has caused.”“The Home Office don’t help me for nothing,” said Ms Keita, whose father is a former Guinean ambassador to Belgium. “They just tell me I need to send my son to Guinea and try to find a visa to come to Britain. How can I send my son to Guinea? He is not Guinean, he is British.”Mohamed and Ms Keita in BritainFamily friends in Brussels said that Mohamed was missing his mother and becoming increasingly nervous as the day he was supposed to start school approaches. Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians say the case is further evidence of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” culture, which has been blamed for scandals such as Windrush and the erroneous sending of deportation letters to EU citizens after Brexit.The uncle of the boy, who was marched away from the plane home by police officers almost two weeks ago, is former Premier League footballer Kamil Zayate. Ms Keita met Mohamed’s father Mangue Bangoura, while visiting her sister in Sheffield. The couple are no longer together but Ms Keita decided to build her life in Britain where Mohamed has spent his entire life. Mr Bangoura is of Guinean origin but is a British citizen who was settled in the UK at the time of his birth. In a letter to the boy’s mother, and seen by The , the Home Office argued that Mohamed should never have been given a British passport in the first place and was given citizenship by mistake. The passport “should never have been issued”, the letter said.Kamil Zayate, right, is Mohamed\u0026#39s uncle and a former Hull City playerThe Home Office letter was first sent in March but Ms Keita says she never received it. It said Mohamed did not qualify for British citizenship because Ms Keita was married to her estranged husband, who lives in Guinea. But the Home Office said that Ms Keita’s marriage meant that under British law, Mohammed could only qualify for citizenship through her or her husband and not the biological father Mr Bangoura, who lives in Leeds. “I never received that letter. I am not stupid. I can’t receive that letter and let my son go on holiday,” said Ms Keita, who is unable to travel to Belgium to be with her son because her passport is with the Home Office awaiting renewal of her residence permit in Britain. The trip, which Mohamed has made before, was to give the boy a holiday while his mother continued to work at a fast food restaurant. The Conservative Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes has now become involved in the case. Officials later emailed the frantic mother a copy when she contacted them after Mohamed was turned away from his flight.Four in five people support a hostile environment for illegal immigrants...A Home Office spokesperson said, “A letter was sent to Mohamed’s mother in March advising her that her son’s passport had been revoked. We understand that despite this Mohamed was taken out of the UK in July and last Sunday was unable to re-enter as he did not hold a valid passport.“The Immigration Minister has asked officials to urgently look into all available options in this case to reunite Mohamed with his mother.”Ms Keita said of the minister’s involvement: “I really hope that this can reunite me with Mohamed,”But immigration lawyers told the  that because Mohamed has never applied for Guinean citizenship, this could leave him stateless.The public overwhelmingly back the hostile environment policy principlesJan Doerfel, a barrister specialising in UK immigration law and who is informally advising friends of Mohamed’s family, said that if Mohamed was not British by birth he was likely to be stateless, but that a stateless child who has lived in Britain for more than five years is eligible to apply for British citizenship under the law.Mr Doerfel, who branded the situation “truly shocking” said: “Mohamed should be urgently granted re-entry into the UK so that his application can be considered while he is in the UK”.Questions have been raised by politicians as to why Mohammed, who was driven to Belgium, was allowed to travel to Brussels by the Home Office after they had revoked his passport. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP in Brussels, has been helping the family. “This is symptomatic of the Home Office hostile environment,” she said, “This poor lad is supposed to starting school in Sheffield next week. Instead he is stateless and stuck in a foreign country away from his mum.”“The British embassy in Belgium need to issue him an emergency travel document immediately so this can be sorted out in the UK”.Woolwich fire: Woman dead and two in hospital as blaze rips through house in south-east LondonDonald Trump rages amid \u0026#39hunt for senior official\u0026#39 who wrote op-ed alleging to be part of \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39Hokkaido earthquake: At least 32 missing as landslides and power outages hit northern JapanBe lenient to parents who abuse their own children if they also care for them, judges toldDon\u0026#39t tell children being gay is a sin, says Chief Rabbi in first LGBT guidance for Orthodox Jewish schoolsWhat is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and can it be used to remove Donald Trump from office?Statins not recommended for healthy pensioners over 75, new study findsThe Novichok assassination attempt step-by-step - CCTV timeline of the suspects\u0026#39 54 hours in the UK New John Lewis \u0026#39Bohemian Rhapsody\u0026#39 advert has viewers looking to ChristmasPrince Charles tells room full of celebrities: \u0026#39None of you could compete with my snazzy dinner jacket\u0026#39Emirates flight quarantined in New York as 10 passengers taken illGRU Russian shadow spy network wreaking worldwide chaos will be \u0026#39dismantled\u0026#39, Downing Street vowsNovichok suspects: the GRU agents \u0026#39trained in assassination and espionage\u0026#39Judge Roy Moore sues Sacha Baron Cohen for $95 million over \u0026#39Who Is America\u0026#39 portrayalComment: Russia is reviving Cold War methods to theatrically kill off its enemiesPolice called to gun shots fired found 8 year olds at birthday party playing with Nerf weaponsStephen Fry effect leads to prostate cancer waiting targets to be missed, NHS says Man miraculously walks away from massive car crash in UkraineHead of NHS blames Premier League football teams for fuelling gambling addictions We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000001858476_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"un calls emergency meeting african swine fever china confirms","story":"Around 38,000 animals have been culled in the world\u0026#39s largest pork producerPandemics and epidemicsThe United Nations has called an emergency meeting of animal disease experts amid fears African swine fever (ASF) is set to sweep through Asia and devastate pig farming.China on Wednesday confirmed its ninth case of the highly infectious disease since it was first spotted in the country a month ago and neighbouring nations are now braced for its spread.Around 38,000 animals have been culled in the world\u0027s largest pork producer as health officials try to halts the spread of a viral haemorrhagic fever which is often fatal to pigs.The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has already warned the disease may spread to other countries. The disease is not harmful to humans, but there is no known vaccine for pigs and the main preventative measure is culling.It\u0027s critical that this region be ready for the very real possibility that ASF could jump the border into other countries, the FAO\u0027s Wantanee Kalpravidh said.Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThat\u0027s why this emergency meeting has been convened – to assess where we are now and to determine how we can work together in a co-ordinated, regional response.Epidemiologists and animal health experts from China\u0027s neighbours are taking part in the meeting in Bangkok, which began on Wednesday.China\u0027s most recent case was announced in northeastern Heilongjiang province, with 12 pigs dead and another 39 infected.The China outbreak is the first time the disease has been detected in east Asia.Spread by ticks, direct contact between pigs, contaminated food and animal feed, it is devastating to herds.Pork products could be responsible for the spread rather than live animals, the FAO has said.The first case in China was spotted in only early August, but herds have already been affected hundreds of miles apart.Newsletter promotion -

That segment was tragically brought to a close when Ross McWhirter\u0026nbspwas assassinated by the Provisional IRA in 1975, prompting Norris to continue alone.As the book’s fame grew, the brewer found itself in the unusual position of being recognised as an international authority on a wide array of\u0026nbspworld records, providing adjudicators\u0026nbspto oversee new attempts at ever-more unlikely feats.Members of the public can apply to set a new record or break an old one via the Guinness World Records website, where many of its achievements are recorded in its “Hall of Fame”, home to free-falling astronaut Felix Baumgartner\u0026nbspand Otto the skateboarding bulldog.\u0026nbspAccording to Guinness, the book only has space to house 4,000 records out of the 40,000 the company holds.UK news in picturesCounter-terrorism police have released images of the two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack in March.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece are quite right to probe the possibility of bringing their treasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia.

They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/27/17/gettyimages-547077386.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/27/17/gettyimages-547077386.jpg","title":"brexit referendum gmb trade union final say peoples vote eu leave remain","story":"Created with Sketch.Decision will pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to switch Labour’s policy in favour of a public voteClick to followIndy PoliticsNew Brexit referendum backed by GMB unionThe GMB union has called for a fresh Brexit referendum because the promises made during the first vote\u0026nbspare “not the reality we are facing”.Britain’s third biggest union delivered a huge boost to the campaign for a public vote on Theresa May’s exit terms by throwing its weight behind the push.It will pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to switch Labour’s official policy in favour of a further referendum, ahead of an expected showdown at the party’s annual conference this month.The Independent has launched its own petition for a Final Say referendum, which has already been signed by almost three-quarters of a million people.In a video statement, Tim Roache, the GMB’s general secretary, condemned “the mess this government is making of Brexit” when “there is so much at stake”.“As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if they’re happy with it,” he said. “Whether they want to accept or reject it“That’s what people deserve now, because the promises that were made during the referendum campaign are simply not the reality we are facing.”Mr Roache said people had “voted for change”, but added: “They did not vote for economic chaos or to put jobs and hard won rights on the line.“That’s why GMB supports your right to decide what sort of Brexit, is the right Brexit.

the party has been edging closer to backing a referendum, with both John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisting it must remain an option.The issue will also be debated by the union movement in Manchester next week, at the TUC conference.Responding, Brandon Lewis MP, Chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “Rerunning the referendum would take us all back to square one.“Jeremy Corbyn should stand up to his union paymasters and rule out a second referendum once and for all.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that

leads the largest group in the European Parliament, the centre-right EPP, said he would “bring Europe back to the people” if he was selected as its candidate in the upcoming elections.Mr Weber, the most senior German MEP, is at a domestic level the member of Germany’s CSU political party – the Bavarian sister party that has been in alliance with Ms Merkel’s CDU since 1949.He is entering a crowded field to win the candidacy for president, with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also thought to want the role.Representatives from the 50 centre-right EPP parties in the EU will meet in Helsinki in November to decide who their lead candidate – or “spitzencandidate” should be for the 2019 European elections.Whoever is picked as the EPP’s candidate is very likely to become the next Commission president as the EPP is expected to come top in the European elections in 2019.Mr Weber’s candidacy is likely to face opposition from some parties on the grounds that he is a German politician – with many countries anxious about alleged German domination of the EU institutions.Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU.

Quite genuinely, I don’t want to pre-judge our own democracy, but I feel that appetite is growing.”May will by-pass Brussels and press EU leaders on Chequers planNew Brexit referendum backed by GMB unionThe TUC is due to discuss its official position, which O’Grady will\u0026nbspgive voice to, at the event.\u0026nbspHowever, the union movement is increasingly in favour of giving people a final say, putting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn under pressure to shift his party\u0027s position.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain’s third biggest union, the GMB, delivered a major boost to The Independent’s campaign by backing the call yesterday.\u0026nbspIn a video statement Tim Roache, its general secretary, condemned “the mess this government is making of Brexit” when “there is so much at stake”.\u0026nbspO’Grady said on the same subject: “Right from the start of this process it should have been about protecting the economy, workers’ rights and jobs, as well as the peace process in Northern Island. Those should have been the red lines.”The union chief has repeatedly said that the UK should consider the so called \u0027Norway plus\u0027\u0026nbspoption of a Brexit under which the UK retains membership of the European single market and customs union.\u0026nbspShe said: “That is our assessment of the best way of protecting jobs and the economy.”\u0026nbspO’Grady said she was concerned about answering a complex problem with a simple question in a referendum but she added: “I’m a trade unionist and there is no way that union negotiators would go into a negotiation about what is going into a deal without getting the approval of the membership.”The UK’s economy was the fastest growing in the OECD prior to the EU Referendum, but since then it has sunk to the bottom of the table. The latest Purchasing Managers Index data on construction and manufacturing have pointed to a slowdown in both sectors.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, there are growing fears about\u0026nbspthe impact of a no-deal Brexit – still the bookies favourite – on ordinary people, particularly those who are “just about managinig”.\u0026nbspA TUC analysis of official data published today will show that average household income has fallen short of spending in every quarter since Theresa May became Prime Minister, with a typical\u0026nbsphousehold pushed £1,250 into the red during her time in Number 10 Downing Street, further underlining the problems created by Brexit.\u0026nbsp“The Government’s own advice shows life will be harder under Brexit and the harder the Brexit the worse it gets,” O’Grady\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbspShe said she believed many of those who voted Leave\u0026nbspwere people who felt they had been forgotten and left behind in Britain.\u0026nbsp“I understand Brexit is the key issue that has dominated government policy, and that it is the most important issue facing the country, but the problems that made people vote that way, people who felt treated like they were disposable, they were there before the referendum they are still there and they are getting worse.\u0026nbsp“Government can’t be a one trick\u0026nbsppony and it is possible to delegate. I want to know who is looking after the interests of working people in this country? Who is minding the shop?\u0026nbsp“I was just re-reading\u0026nbspthe speech Theresa May made on the Downing Street steps when she took office. It is about the government being on the side of working people and prioritising their interests against those of the\u0026nbspwealthy. But that has’t happened.“Look at the way having workers on boards was dropped.”O’Grady also highlighted how\u0026nbspthe Government commissioned review into modern working\u0026nbspand the gig economy\u0026nbspby Matthew Taylor\u0026nbsphas been kicked into the Whitehall long grass.\u0026nbsp“As far as we were concerned it didn’t go far enough. But where has it gone?\u0026nbspWhatever happened to it?\u0026nbspOur release shows that\u0026nbspevery single quarter under Theresa May average households had more going out than coming in. This is what happens when you have flat wages and insecurity at work.“We have seen the balance of power shift against working people. We know there are nearly 4m on zero hours contracts, agency workers, temporary workers or very low paid self-employed workers, which is very often a proxy for not being\u0026nbspself-employed at all.\u0026nbsp“They don’t have any basic rights. So if they fall sick, want to have a baby, or simply want the national minimum wage it is a struggle for them.

His efforts will be focused on helping Democrats in Orange County, California, a Republican stronghold in the liberal state, as well as lending a hand in the Ohio governor race - all while competing against endorsements and tweets from Donald Trump.\u0026nbspMr Obama is hoping to inspire voters “in local, down-ballot races to build the Democratic Party’s bench”,\u0026nbspspokesperson Katie Hill told the New York Times. The president will be heading to Cleveland to campaign for former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorney general Richard Cordray, who hopes to defeat Republican incumbent John Kasich. It was Mr Obama who had encouraged Mr Cordray to run in Ohio, where Republicans have held the majority in state government since 2010. There are seven Democrats looking to challenge Republicans in Orange County, all in districts which Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 election. Thus far in 2018, Mr Obama has been limiting himself to select fundraising speeches and issuing one round of national endorsements.However, Ms Hill said “this moment in our country is too perilous for Democratic voters to sit out” and it appears the same is true for one of the party’s most popular campaigners.

The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/23/japan-earthquake.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/23/japan-earthquake.jpg","title":"japan earthquake magnitude 7 sapporo latest updates","story":"Created with Sketch.People trapped in rubble, local police reportClick to followThe IndependentNational broadcaster NHK reported a landslide buried houses in HokkaidoA powerful earthquake has hit Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido,\u0026nbspcausing a landslide that has engulfed houses.Several people were reported injured and trapped in the rubble, while power in several areas was cut off, but there were no early reports of deaths.The quake, which struck just after 3am\u0026nbspon Thursday, had a magnitude of 6.7, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.The US\u0026nbspGeological Survey earlier said it struck some 112 km southeast of Sapporo, a major metropolitan area of 1.9 million people.An aftershock measuring 5.3 rocked the area\u0026nbspa short while later.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6 am, told reporters his government had set up a command centre to coordinate relief and rescue efforts.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Mr\u0026nbspAbe instructed officials to find out\u0026nbspthe extent of damage and help those affected.The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake may have caused a small sea level change in coastal areas, but no tsunami was expected.\u0026nbspJapan is recovering from the worst typhoon to hit the country in 25 years, which struck the western part of the country on Tuesday, killing at least 11\u0026nbspand causing major damage to the region’s main airport.Japan, which is situated on the “Ring of Fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin, accounts for about 20 per cent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.Typhoon Jebi: Extremely strong winds and heavy rain hit Japan Vehicles damaged in OsakaHigh waves hit breakwaters at a port of AkiA tanker is seen after it slammed into the side of a bridge connecting the airport to the mainlandPeople walk against strong winds in NagoyaDamaged traffic boards and telecommunication relay poles are seen after they were brought down by strong winds caused by typhoon Jebi in OsakaA tanker ship smashed into a bridge connecting the city of Izumisano with Kansai airportThe forecast track of of Typhoon JebiA man looks at a truck overturnedA truck sitting at an angle after being blown over by strong winds on the Seto Ohashi bridge in SakadeA woman holds broken umbrella as a powerful typhoon hits OsakaBoats float along with debris during Typhoon Jebi in Nishinomiya CityPolice officers attempt to remove fallen trees A tanker after it slammed into the side of the bridge connecting the airport to the mainlandDocuments are spread under desks after windows broke at Gifu Prefectural Government in GifuA tree damaged by Typhoon Jebi in front of Heian Shrine in KyotoDamaged vehicles blown by strong windsA building damaged by Typhoon Jebi in OsakaVehicles damaged in OsakaHigh waves hit breakwaters at a port of AkiA tanker is seen after it slammed into the side of a bridge connecting the airport to the mainlandPeople walk against strong winds in NagoyaDamaged traffic boards and telecommunication relay poles are seen after they were brought down by strong winds caused by typhoon Jebi in OsakaA tanker ship smashed into a bridge connecting the city of Izumisano with Kansai airportThe forecast track of of Typhoon JebiA man looks at a truck overturnedA truck sitting at an angle after being blown over by strong winds on the Seto Ohashi bridge in SakadeA woman holds broken umbrella as a powerful typhoon hits OsakaBoats float along with debris during Typhoon Jebi in Nishinomiya CityPolice officers attempt to remove fallen trees A tanker after it slammed into the side of the bridge connecting the airport to the mainlandDocuments are spread under desks after windows broke at Gifu Prefectural Government in GifuA tree damaged by Typhoon Jebi in front of Heian Shrine in KyotoDamaged vehicles blown by strong windsA building damaged by Typhoon Jebi in OsakaOn March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, struck under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai.

In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21m.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel’s most important ally in EuropeIsrael’s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary’s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew worldwide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined “A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem,” while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?” Tamar Zandberg, head of the leftist Meretz party, wrote on Facebook.“Because Duterte is willing to support the occupation (of the West Bank),” she said.The most controversial quotes from Rodrigo Duterte“These sons of whores are destroying our children.

In the past he has joked about wanting to rape an Australian national who was killed during a prison riot in 1989, he called Pope Francis a “son of a whore” for causing a traffic jam in the capital Manilla, and labelled God a “son of bitch”.He has also advised citizens not to wear condoms despite an HIV crisis, forcibly kissed a woman on stage and told soldiers to shoot female rebels in the vagina.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/996127_1.jpg","title":"brexit latest second referendum no deal brexit andy burnham manchester labour","story":"The Labour politician today said that he would support a second referendum on the Brexit vote as a last resort to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without an agreement.He said despite risks a second say on whether Britain should leave the EU could result in social unrest as well as deepening isions in British society, he would still push for it.Mr Burnham also added that it was \u0026ldquoalt-right activists that were pushing for a no deal agenda in order exploit a ide between Britons that wanted a hard Brexit and a soft one.He risked further infuriating Brexiteers by arguing that if Britain was heading towards a no-deal Brexit it should be up to Brussels to cancel the March 2019 deadline to allow time for further negotiations.

Marriage should be cherished, says, Ann Widdecombe Ms Latham, who has received support from Tory and Labour MPs for the Bill, also said: Marriage is a major life decision for which children are not emotionally and physically ready.Setting the minimum age of marriage at 18 provides an objective rather than subjective standard of maturity which safeguards a child from being married when they are not physically, mentally or emotionally ready.Many would argue there should be a minimum level of maturity and free and full consent about whether, whom and when to marry.The International Human Rights Conventions on women\u0027s rights and children says countries should end the practice of enabling child marriage below 18, thus the UK is violating these same commitments.Conservative MP Kevin Foster (Torbay) said the proposed Bill raised several questions, telling MPs: I accept the points that are made and it\u0027s obvious there\u0027s a point strongly made around the idea that you can\u0027t just get married at 16 or 17 without an element of consent.Introducing the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Bill has been put to Parliament (Image: )This is a very long-standing legal age, and for me there are all sorts of arguments about what should be at 16 and what should be at 17.Mr Foster went on: It\u0027d be at 16 you could decide legally, if we didn\u0027t change the age of (sexual) consent, the life-changing decision to have children yet you couldn\u0027t actually get married until you were 18.I think that would be a bit of an oddity in our law.Mr Foster also questioned what would happened if England and Wales raised the age of consent to marriage or civil partnership but Scotland did not.He later raised concerns about seeking to introduce such a change via a backbench private member\u0027s bill, suggesting a wider debate would be needed.Ms Latham was allowed to introduce her Bill and asked for it to receive a second reading on October 26.It faces a battle to become law if it does not attract Government support and due to a lack of parliamentary time to debate private members\u0027 bills.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she hardens it for Brexiteers, it’s even less likely to fly.Whatever Downing Street says, it’s not a plan if it has no possibility of proceeding.

Here’s more on what’s going on.Thousands of Americans have taken to Twitter to protest their outrage at one of the faces included in Nike’s 30th anniversary campaign.Many have threatened to burn their Nike clothing and trainers after it was revealed that Nike had signed up controversial kneeling quarterback Colin Kaepernick to be part of its Just Do It campaign.The online backlash since Nike unveiled him as one of the chosen athletes has been aggressive and non-stop.Nike retweeted a photo of the former San Francisco 49ers player with the tagline: Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.While many commented underneath supporting his stance, the vast majority were less forgiving, with one saying: Big mistake Nike!Larra, who describes herself as a full-time softball mom, went on: My family will not be buying, wearing, or speaking the name Nike.Kneeling during the National Anthem is unacceptable... The soldiers that died to maintain his rights deserve his respect.She was not the only one with social media awash with videos of Americans chucking expensive sneakers into furnaces.Sean Clancy posted a video of his pristine white Nike shoes in flames with the words: Since when did the American flag and National Anthem become so offensive?Another self-professed conservative was seen throwing his trainers into an outdoor furnace, adding: Nike, due to your support of Colin Kaepernick in your coming ads, I as an American can no longer support your company.Coach Trotter uploaded an ominous pic of himself waving an electric flame over dozens of running shoes, saying: Cant believe Nike would do such a thing.The Oregon-based company saw its share price affected on Tuesday as the call for a boycott spread.Nikes share price fell by more than three percent on September 4.At the start of trading its share were valued at 82.20 but by 2pm this had fallen to just over 80.But its share price is still up by 27 percent since the start of the year.Its market capitalisation is around 127.4billion.The company was originally founded in January 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight.It became Nike Inc in May 1971.Knight is the companys chairman emeritus while Mark Parker is the chairman, president and CEO.Andrew Campion is the chief financial officer.The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback divided the country when he refused to stand and instead knelt during the national anthem in several NFL games in the 2016 season to protest racial inequality in the country.The 30-year-old’s protest also focused on police violence against African-Americans, and is an open supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement.The US president has called players who disrespect the US flag sons of bitches and called for them to be sacked. Kaepernick, who has not played in the NFL since last year, claims team owners have deliberately frozen him out because of his activism.He is suing the NFL and his case looks likely to go to a trial.In May 2018, the NFL announced that teams whose players knelt for the national anthem would be fined under a new policy.The league said players not willing to stand for The Star-Spangled Banner could stay in the changing rooms until it had been performed.The star has been on a contract with Nike throughout the kneeling row, but it has now been renegotiated to make him part of the anniversary campaign.The United States continues to remain divided on the kneeling issue.Kaepernick is one of a number of sports stars to appear in the 30th anniversary Just Do It ad.The anniversary campaign is a return to the slogan that made the company famous.Other sports stars featured include fellow NFL players Odell Beckham Jr and Shaquem Griffin, basketball legend LeBron James and tennis star Serena Williams.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

So any high level of bacteria would not be acceptable by our high standards.We have taken note of the interim results published by our partner Thomas Cook, which matches with our independent investigations concerning the good results of water and air quality.Our high standards in terms of hygiene are not negotiable and of course apply also to all of our franchise hotels as well.Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser added: These results, while not establishing the cause of the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper, have prompted us to commit further resource to tackle hygiene standards in those hotels where we identify a higher than average level of sickness.The room where the couple died has since been sealed off and a do not disturb sign hangs from its handle, with guards stationed outside it around the clock.Following the deaths, it emerged the hotel had been hit by dozens of sickness complaints.And it has now revealed that on Friday guests had a note put under their doors advising them “water pipelines cleansing” would be taking place and advising them not to use taps in their rooms.The Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel remains unavailable for booking for Thomas Cook customers until further notice."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431274186-e1536168035268.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pound soars as angela merkel opens the door to a brexit deal by backing down on europes red lines","story":"But Theresa May hit back to demand a detailed trade deal - as the PM prepared a last ditch bid to sell her troubled Chequers plan to Tory faithful.The pound soared after claims from the German Chancellor that she was prepared to use “all our force and creativity” to ensure there is not a No Deal Brexit.And Berlin insiders told Bloomberg that Germany is now prepared to accept a much less detailed declaration on trade than Mrs Merkel had originally supported - sparking fears of “kicking the can down the road”.The fudge would see the UK sign the Withdrawal Agreement and secure a transition, but quit the bloc with only vague promises on what future relations will be.Such a scenario, dubbed a ‘blind Brexit’, is opposed by Emmanuel Macron and most Brexit-backing MPs who fear further climb downs after Britain has departed.Giving evidence to MPs today Dominic Raab repeated demands for a detailed trade deal - in return for the whopping £38billion divorce bill.The Brexit Secretary warned MPs would be unlikely to back a deal that had an “unclear destination point” and stressed: “We would like to be very clear on the choice of relationship.”And Downing Street said: “There needs to be a meaningful vote on the agreement, based on proper information.

Now we need to catch them.” His brother Matthew, 47, said: “It’s awful that we can’t hold them on murder charges. I want to know what Theresa May is going to do about it.”A senior security source said: “They’re going to have pay a cost for what they’ve done. Nothing is off the table now.”The two officers – working under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov – are suspected of working for the GRU’s Spetsnaz wing.Meaning ‘Special Purpose’, the wing carry out its dangerous missions overseas. On top of foreign assassinations – known as ‘wet jobs’ – they also give covert support to militant groups, and run proxy armies in warzones such as Ukraine and Syria.While the PM didn’t call out the Kremlin boss by name, sources insisted there was “no doubt” on the Joint Intelligence Committee – the overall security body that supervised the long investigation – that the Skrpial “wet job” was authorised by Putin personally.And how did this gangster state react yesterday to being exposed? By sniggering at Theresa May’s dancing.Russia must face tougher sanctions. The international community must demand the suspects be handed over for trial.Britain must hit back at Putin’s spy network and his oligarch mates who launder their dirty money in London.The Sun congratulates our intelligence services and police on their diligence and skill in identifying these hitmen. Some 11,000 hours of CCTV was sifted.But where does this all leave Comrade Cob? Six months ago Corbyn, briefed by his Trotskyite lackey Seumas Milne, parroted Putin’s line. Even yesterday, with hard evidence before him, he still couldn’t condemn the Russian regime.Imagine — with one murdered and three stricken by Novichok — if the Kremlin’s useful idiot had been our Prime Minister.The PM also vowed to build a new coalition across the EU to enforce a biting round of new sanctions against Russia to punish it for the shameful state act.She also blasted Russia for a long litany of “obfuscation and lies” over what happened in Salisbury.Mrs May added: “Their attempts to hide the truth by pushing out a deluge of disinformation simply reinforces their culpability”.Petrov and Boshirov are also known to have been aided by the Russian government on their mission, who provided them with logistical help such as false passports.Saturday, 3 MarchSunday, 4 MarchFriday, June 29 Saturday, June 30Sunday July 8Friday, July 13July 18July 19July 20July 30August 8Whitehall sources also last night revealed that the JIC believe they know the men’s real identities, but are holding the sensitive information back at the moment.MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal was a colonel in the GRU, making the assassination bid on him also a personal revenge mission.The Charge d’Affaires in the Russian Embassy was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down yesterday, standing in for his ambassador who is on holiday.He was told of the charges that the police want to press on Petrov and Boshirov, as well the Government’s determination that the men are eventually hauled to London to face justice.Police also issued a European Arrest Warrant and Interpol red notice on the pair, meaning that while the Kremlion will refuse any attempt to extradite them, they will never be able to leave Russia again.Mrs May spoke to a series of close ally world leaders to brief them on the findings, including US President Donald Trump and Canada PM Justin Trudeau.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any Russian role in the Salisbury poisoning, and again insisted Britain must hand over the case files so a joint investigation can be launched.And Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesman also said Moscow has no knowledge of either of the suspects.THE GRU - Russia’s “Main Intelligence Directorate” - is a shadowy organisation with chiefs handpicked by Vladimir Putin.Estimates suggest it has six times as many spies abroad as the FSB - formerly the KGB.It was founded in 1918 by then-Soviet leader Vladmir Lenin who demanded its independence from other secret services.GRU defector Viktor Suvorov said new recruits were shown film of a traitor being burned alive.The GRU has recently been linked with actions in Syria and the downing of a flight in eastern Ukraine.Ex-FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko - murdered in London in 2006 - accused it of bombing four apartments in Moscow in 1999.It has also been accused of hacking and interference in foreign elections.Tory MPs openly mocked the GRU last night for the botched hit as well as allowing itself agents to be identified.Former Army officer-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer said: “I hope this toilet tradecraft will help reduce the perception that Russia is some intelligence/military behemoth to be cowered from.“Putin should be treated with the distain he deserves - a dull thug running a mafia state.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party?

Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed?

So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves.

Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The richest one per cent pay 27 per cent of all income tax, as opposed to just 11 under Labour in the 1970s. Raising the top rate nets LESS money since the wealthiest find ways to avoid it, or leave.Low corporation tax is partly behind the incredible job creation since 2010. Reverse it and see the dole queues grow.And an avalanche of taxes on wealth won’t bring equality. The overall burden is near a 30-year high. Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments. Totting up a menu is a few hours’ work once in a while.Better that than impose more nanny-state taxes to crowbar diners off grub they like. It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary.

Fishermen from the two nations clashed off the coast of Normandy a week ago, with sailors hurling rocks and vessels crashing into each other. Trouble flared over a long-running row about UK boats harvesting the shellfish in the Seine Bay. French fishermen leave the beds to recover at certain times, but British vessels are not bound by the same rules - unleashing Gallic resentment. A joint statement from the UK and French governments last night revealed concord had been reached. About 35 French boats confronted five British craft off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting that rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation.  The clashes have occurred in a scallop-rich area known as the Baie de Seine off the coast of Normandy. National regulations allow British ships to fish legally in the area all year round, but French fishermen are banned from taking the molluscs between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. The clashes came after the breakdown of a 2013 agreement in which larger British vessels agreed not to fish in parts of the area, so they would be abiding by same conditions as the French fleet, in return for gaining more fishing opportunities. It broke down this year after the French industry said they wanted the deal to be extended to smaller British boats.

This was, some said, the Prime Minister at her best. Her delivery needed to be good - she had a lot of sins to hide. Just over the two years’ ago Mrs May had also faced MPs when Home Secretary to deliver a statement on the inquest into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. Like the Skripals, Litvinenko had been poisoned  by two Russian agents “probably” acting on the orders of Vladimir Putin. First, it should be noted that Mrs May had tried to block a full public inquiry into this killing on British soil.  In a letter to the Coroner Sir Robert Owen she cited “international relations” as a reason for the Government’s opposition - words which implied she did not want to upset the Putin administration. It was only after a tireless campaign by Mr Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, that the Cameron government relented and agreed to hold the inquiry. Mrs May’s response to the final report in January 2016 is enlightening. Three times she was asked by Conservative and Labour MPs to introduce a Magnitsky Act in response to the murder. This is a US law introduced in 2012 that allows the US Government to freeze the assets and ban the entry of Russians suspected of human rights abuses. Three times Mrs May rejected calls for a UK version of this act, telling MPs: “We already have powers that are at least as robust, if not more so, than the powers in the Magnitsky Act.” Today in the Commons she boasted the Government was now bringing in the Magnitsky Act as part of a raft of measures taken in response to the Salisbury attack. Many believe she should have acted sooner.  In a telling exchange in 2016 she was asked by former Brexit Secretary David Davis, then as now a backbencher, to impose travel sanctions on leading figures in the Putin regime and expel Russian intelligence officers from London. Mrs May replied the Government had “already taken a number of measures” and refused the invitation to take further action. Perhaps then, as now, Mrs May was worried about the health of the Conservative Party finances which have benefited from donations from wealthy Russians.

Since its founding in Manchester in 1868, the Trades Union Congress has backed workers and fought attempts to undermine their rights and pay.   Today it represents five million people. This week the Mirror looks back at some critical points in its remarkable history.  When Jayaben Desai put on her coat at the end of the day, she was told by her line manager at the Grunwick factory that she had to do overtime, and would be dismissed if she left. It was already 6.55pm and she replied: “What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. But in a zoo there are many types of animals. “Some are monkeys who dance on your fingertips, others are lions who can bite your head off. We are the lions, Mr Manager. I want my freedom.” And with that roar of defiance in 1976, 4ft 10in mother-of-two Mrs Desai launched a two-year “strikers in saris” campaign for union recognition that would draw 20,000 protesters to the streets and threaten the Government.  At the Grunwick Film Processing Laboratories in Dollis Hill, North London, photographic film was sent in, processed, and prints posted back.  Its workforce was 80% British Asian. Once middle-class business owners, in 1970s Britain their skin colour meant they were denied good jobs and were forced into low-paid, manual work. “It nagged away like  a sore on their necks,” said Mrs Desai.  They were also – wrongly, it turned out – regarded as docile. Mrs Desai, who came here from Tanzania in 1969, said: “Asians all needed work. So they took whatever was available. Grunwick put out leaflets, ‘Come and we will give you a job. We give jobs to everyone’. When I went, a friend followed. And soon they were full of Asians.”  But conditions were poor. Overtime was compulsory and last-minute. The average pay was \u0026pound28 a week, while the national average was \u0026pound72. Male bosses even demanded staff ask permission to go to the toilet, and the mostly-female staff were ashamed to ask. Bosses were heard telling younger, white English girls, “You don’t want to come and work here, love, we won’t be able to pay the sort of wages that’ll keep you here”. The workers felt humiliated, like they had escaped tyranny in one country only to become trapped in another. In the hot summer of 1976, Britain recorded its highest-ever temperature of 35.6C. But at Grunwick there was no air conditioning, and on August 20 Devshi Bhudia was fired for working too slowly. Three others walked out in support and when Mrs Desai was sacked too her son Sunil joined them. Her line manager referred to them as “chattering monkeys” and she told him they were lions. Three days later the six began a picket, having been advised to join the moderate clerical union Apex. Within days, 75 more staff walked out, complaining of low pay, long hours, bullying, racism and petty restrictions, and demanding trade union recognition. A day later, Grunwick bosses offered to give them all their jobs back if they dropped the call for a union. It was rejected out of hand and 137 staff were fired for staging an illegal strike. On September 14, a management car drove over Mrs Desai’s foot as she protested. A week later, another woman was hospitalised by a collision and the strike had its first arrest. Unions then were white, male and working class. Despite the fact the strikers were Asian, female and middle class, the TUC urged other unions to “give all possible assistance”. It was a groundbreaking moment in race relations and, for the first time, the national labour movement threw its weight behind ethnic minority workers.  The local postmen refused to deliver Grunwick’s mail, their chairman saying: “You don’t say ‘no’ to Mrs Desai.” Postal deliveries were critical to the business and by November it faced liquidation. There were debates in Parliament, more arrests, and bosses agreed to talks in return for the reinstatement of deliveries. Postmen who continued to “black” mail were suspended for three weeks. Grunwick boss George Ward launched legal action, winning praise from Opposition leader Margaret Thatcher. Acas was brought in to arbitrate but bosses gave “loyal workers” a 15% pay rise and refused to let anyone talk to them. When Acas found in favour of the strikers, Grunwick took it to court. In the meantime, the strike spread. Mrs Desai toured 1,000 workplaces to rally support, saying: “We must not give up. Would Gandhi give up? Never!” Pickets were held at chemist shops which sent films to the factory and in March 1977, 1,400 people marched through Willesden, north-west London in support. In April, Grunwick raised wages by another 10% then, two months later ,the Brent Trades Council organised a week of mass protests involving flying pickets from all over the country. They included print workers, student unions and miners from as far afield as Yorkshire and Kent. Arthur Scargill was among 300 arrested by the end of the week as they tried to block minibuses driving staff into the Grunwick factory. Mrs Desai said later: “Tears were in my eyes to see these people… They were hurting themselves, police were charging them with horses and everything and still they were standing strong.” Crowds were held back by aggressive police from the notorious Special Patrol Group. Grunwick was backed by the ultra-Right National Association For Freedom, whose members circumvented the postal strike by collecting photos at the factory and getting volunteers to post them all over the country in what was known as Operation Pony Express. A small dispute at a London factory became a battle between Left and Right. In June, PM James Callaghan warned that “this was indeed a crisis” and told Home Secretary Merlyn Rees: “There could well be fatalities and in circumstances which might be in danger of bringing the Government down.” After Arthur Scargill called for a “national day of action” in July, 20,000 people jammed the streets around Dollis Hill tube station, marching and blocking the gates to the factory. But in the end, Grunwick won its legal battle and the Acas report was declared invalid. Even although the Government-ordered Scarman Inquiry found in favour of the workers, the TUC and Apex stepped back from the campaign.  Mrs Desai and three others picketed the TUC, sitting outside its offices on hunger strike. Their union suspended them without pay for a month and Mrs Desai said: “Trade union support is like honey on the elbow – you can smell it, you can feel it but you cannot taste it.” When the strike was declared over on July 14, 1978, Mrs Desai told the final meeting: “We have shown that workers like us, new to these shores, will never accept being treated without dignity or respect. We have shown that white workers will support us.” None of the sacked workers were reinstated. Mrs Desai found sewing work, taught at Brent Indian Association and Harrow College and finally became “free as a bird” when she passed her driving test aged 60. She was given a gold medal by the GMB union in 2007 and died in 2010, at 77.

Its sting is so powerful it can send muscles into spasms and angered hornets can squirt venom into the eyes of enemies. Hornets were seen feasting on wasps near Goonhavern, between Truro and Newquay, Cornwall on August 27. Stephen Jull took a picture while he was with his friend Sarah near some woodland in an unpopulated area. Mr Jull, from Camborne, sent the photo to Cornwall Live and said the insect was one of several measuring up to 50mm . He said: It was one of several individuals all about 40 to 50mm in length. All were mild-mannered and feasting on insects including wasps.  Meanwhile, over the border in Devon, another one was photographed in Newton Abbot by a Paignton resident. The image shows the insect is about the same size as a \u0026pound2 coin, measuring about 3cm in length. The resident was concerned it may have been one of the invasive Asian hornets which have been widely reported this year. But after Cornwall Live contacted an insect expert to find out exactly what the vicious looking critter was, she confirmed it was in fact a European hornet.  Louisa Bartlett, head keeper at Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, said: This is, in fact, a European hornet , which is part of the wasp family . Although they seem big and scary, they are in fact less likely to sting compared to the common wasp . They can range in size from 2-5cm in length and usually nest in holes in trees. European hornets are known to feed on large insects but can also strip off bark from trees to access the sap.  They tend to sting only when they are stepped on or grabbed, but generally avoid conflict. The sting is said to be very painful and anyone stung by these insects is advised to seek medical attention. Rare cases can also be serious, with some casualties displaying symptoms including tingling at the site of the sting, as well as headaches and shortness of breath.

Even though he wasn\u0027t particularly fussed about losing weight, the people who cared about him the most were terrified of the potential health risks. When Nat, 40, met John in 2001 he weighed 28st and wore size 6XL clothes. The couple fell in love and married in 2005, and two years later they became a little family when baby George was born.  But Nat was extremely worried about her husband\u0027s weight, and didn\u0027t know what to do about it. She said: I fell in love with him regardless of his size. For as long as I can remember John talked about losing weight but he was never serious or ready for it. Me and John\u0027s mum were secretly upset, emotional and worried about John\u0027s weight a lot. We often cried to each other about it but didn\u0027t know what we could do.  But then one night seven years ago, John popped out to get fish and chips and his life changed forever. When he pulled up outside the chippy carrying \u0026pound10 to buy his family some dinner, he spotted a sign for Slimming World. Instead of going into the shop, he went into the meeting and enrolled with the weightloss programme. John, who weighed a whopping 26st at the time, decided to keep his decision a secret, telling only Nat, his mum Avril and his auntie Maureen what he was doing. Nat said: I knew that it was down to John to make it work but once he explained what he needed to be eating with Slimming world I got on board with it, getting the right shopping in, making Slimming World meals, and making sure the kids\u0027 treats were out of sight.  John cut out all takeaway food but chocolate was his real weakness so at Easter 2014 he ate about 20,000 calories of Easter Eggs and then went cold turkey and didn\u0027t touch chocolate ever again. In the first month John lost 4lbs, but in the following months he really got to grips with Slimming World, losing a stone in the second month and 10lbs the next. By the following Christmas John had lost an incredible six stones and the Christmas after his weight loss was up to ten stones. In 2012 the couple welcomed their second child, a beautiful little girl called Elsie, and John had dropped to an impressive 16st 2lb. He decided it was time to take up exercise, and quickly built up his fitness by going to spinning classes and playing football.  He also started training for triathlons and more recently has taken up ballroom dancing. Now, John is the healthiest he\u0027s ever been, and can keep up with George, 10, and Elsie, six. Seven weeks ago he had a tummy tuck to remove 3.5lbs of excess skin.

Karen Robb, 43, discussed meeting the vulnerable teen in a park to do naughty things. She also sent images of herself naked from the waist up and encouraged him to perform sexual acts after striking up a relationship with him on social media. Robb continued grooming the boy for weeks until she eventually met up with him. But she was outed after her suspicious partner of 15 years found messages on her phone. The boy\u0027s parents also later discovered they had met up and exchanged pictures. Robb admitted inciting a child to commit sexual activity and meeting a child following grooming. Wearing a baggy Hawaii t-shirt and blue hoodie, Robb, from Blackpool, Lancashire, appeared emotionless as she was jailed for 16 months.  Prosecuting, Frances McEntee said: There is a degree of rationalisation by the boy who says he felt he had to engage in the relationship. He did willingly engage in what was an inappropriate online relationship. He repeatedly expressed his love for the defendant. Over time Robb responded with a kiss, then turned to explicit chat, with the naive youngster responding he wanted to hold hands. She sent images of herself naked from the waist up and encouraged him to perform sexual acts.  Mr McEntee added: She\u0027s clearly taken advantage of a vulnerable young man. It\u0027s apparent his parents had become aware. His mother was in the practice of checking his phone and discovered some of the exchanges. He became very distressed. Defending, John Woodward said Robb was a totally different lady now to when the offences were committed. He told the court at the time she had been homeless and sofa surfing after her relationship had come to an end. Mr Woodward added: She says her partner had been violent to her towards the end of their relationship. She took comfort from communication with other males on Facebook and other social media. That\u0027s what led her partner to become suspicious about her extramarital flirtations. She was herself quite vulnerable.  He added she now had a stable home and a new partner and asked the court to suspend her jail term. But Judge Heather Lloyd refused, telling Robb that when the boy sent her messages, she should have taken him off your Facebook account, not encourage him. She said: In your pre-sentence report you denied deriving sexual pleasure from this behaviour. I do not accept that. It is an explanation often given by offenders. Of course you derived sexual pleasure from it, otherwise you would not have acted as you did, and it is clear you were flattered by the attention. This was not a moment of madness. This conversation and this behaviour went on for weeks and you went several steps further than talking.

In this dingy two star hotel the Russian pair spent two nights putting finishing touches to their shocking plan. As Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov checked in they would have smirked at the irony of the large Health and Safety poster on the wall behind the tiny front desk. Little did the receptionist know his new guests were actually carrying one of the most deadly poisons on the planet. Using a cheap green biro they signed the register like all other guests. If they wanted to remain anonymous for as long as possible this was the perfect place to choose. Rooms cost between \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound74 a night and guests are allowed to pay in cash.  The City Stay Hotel sits on busy Bow Road, in east London, and no-one cares who slips in and out. Police found traces of Novichok here when they finally discovered the Russians’ hideout. And the owner has clearly gone to huge attempts to ensure there is no danger for current guests. The whole building has been freshly painted in a light yellow. Pots of paint prop up the doors to allow fresh air into the hotel. Even the carpets are new.  The entire establishment has been scrubbed clean from top to bottom following the Russian hitmen’s stay. The couple would have been offered the \u0026pound4.90 breakfast or they could help themselves to the continental for free in a basement room. “But please clean all your plates and cutlery away when you have finished,” said the receptionist under the eagle eye of three politan police officers. “That’s the one thing we would ask.”  The breakfast room is in the basement down a narrow set of stairs. It is dark with a small kitchen and an large array of cereals. The bedrooms are fairly spartan - with many looking out over the noisy A12 outside. An Enteprise rent-a-car parking lot is across the road and Docklands Light Railway trains trundle past every few minutes. The shared bathrooms are basic to say the least. The showers are small but the toilets clean. Each room has a fan, an iron and a spare sheet.  The manager of the hotel, who declined to give his name, read out a statement to the press. He said: “The City Stay Hotel in Bow Road is open for business as usual. “We are fully supporting the police investigation. “We are reassured that the police and Public Health England have confirmed very clearly that there is no health risk whatsoever to our guests or our staff. “We are receiving a lot of media attention and we would kindly ask that you allow our staff and guests to go about their business unhindered.” But the five police officers who were in and around the hotel yesterday showed that things are unlikely to be the same again. And it’s the ultimate irony the two hitmen were able to tune in to Channel 135 in their room – where they could find Russia Today.  Locals were stunned the Russian suspects chose the modest City Stay Hotel on Bow Road in east London as their choice of venue. Two pubs sit within 100 yards either side of it, The Little Driver and The Bow Bells. And within 200 yards is a functioning police station and magistrates’ court. A Texaco garage is opposite, a closed up cafe nearby and a couple of takeaways. There are few amenities to speak of and the pair could easily have flown under the radar. One local worker said: “It’s really bizarre to come here to stay. “There’s not much around. I think that’s why they chose it. No one would think of here.” Another said it was mainly used as a through-road to get to nearby Stratford, which boast cafes, restaurants, pubs and the Olympic Park.  “I’d say it’s quite rough round here, we’ve had a lot of acid attacks and stabbings, and it’s a bad area for drugs,” said Ellie Smith, 22. “People would usually go to Stratford as there’s not much here, it’s a place you pass through.” Abdul Musabbir, who works in the Bow Church DLR station kiosk, which is directly next to the hotel, said the area has remained unchanged in the past decade aside from a rise in stabbings and drug dealings. “It is mostly tourists who stay in that hotel, but I’ve never seen anything there that seems untoward,” he added. Nobody at local pubs, takeaways, shops or cafes recognised the pictures of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. A barmaid at The Little Driver boozer said: “Why would you come all the way from Russia to stay on the Bow Road? “It makes no sense.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study revealed there are now 11 types of parent to be found at the school gates. According to the report, the scariest new school run parent is the fierce ‘clipboard mum’ who gave up her high-flying career to run the school parents’ association, with 63 per cent of other parents finding her intimidating.  ‘Clipboard mums’ are famed for pressurising parents to sign up to school and charity events, according to research by ChannelMum   The rapid rise of social media means over half of school gates now have ‘ Instagram mums’ who snap ‘school run selfies’ in full make-up and a new outfit each day.   Instagram mums were also rated intimidating by 60 per cent of parents.  Siobhan Freegard, founder of ChannelMum said: “Back to school is second only to Christmas in terms of stress for parents - but the school gates can also be a source of tremendous support.  “Whether you’re an \u0027activewear mum\u0027, an Instagram mum or a \u0027good enough mum\u0027, we’re all trying to do the right thing and give our kids the best start in life.” Also feared is the ‘craft mum’ who creates school play costumes from scratch and sneers at shop-bought cakes at school bake sales. Half of parents  quizzed recognise her at their school. However, the most common new tribe is the ‘activewear mum’ who dons trendy workout gear for the school run and jogs her kids to school. Three quarters of parents polled said they have \u0027activewear mums\u0027 at their school.

Eight young thugs, including seven teenagers, were convicted of the murder of Sait Mboob, 18, and today started life prison sentences.   A court heard Sait stood up to the notorious 7M gang on a Manchester street but was hunted down, hit with a stolen Fiat 500 and then hacked eight times with machetes by the masked mob.   Six days previous, members of the gang posted a professionally shot drill music video on YouTube .  7M\u0027s films glorify violence and drug dealing, using the city\u0027s infamous Gunchester tag with lyrics to a third video called \u0027Hammer\u0027s Up\u0027, bragging: This is the life you chose, stick the road, stick to the code - if you get hit then you won\u0027t get up.  The chilling video was played to a horrified jury at the trial. Emil Bell, 17, was ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years. Laif Morgan, 23, was ordered to serve 19 years whilst Lequornne Morgan, Requan Brown, Ryan Isaacs and Husam Ghazanfar, all 19 were each ordered to serve 18 years. Shayne Stewart, 16, and Kiahus Baddoo, 17, were ordered to serve 14 years. Another suspect, 23, was detained on Monday.  Sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, Justice Timothy King said: The attack was a sustained and brutal one, aggravated by the indescribable use of violence. It was an appalling offences of gratuitous violence. Members of the gang were related to members of a group known as \u00277M\u0027 and there is no justification for your conduct which led to the death of one young man and serious injuries being inflicted on others. You cruelly brought the life of Sait Mboob to a permanent end. There are no word I can adequately express as to the grief you have each caused to his mother and wider family. I have to recall that many of you have expressed no genuine remorse for what has occurred.  In a statement, Sait\u0027s heartbroken mum, Ellen Berry said: We were a normal happy family, living out lives as one unit. Sait wasn\u0027t just my son he was my best friend. One of the hardest things as a mother is not only to lose your child in such a callous act of brutality, but having to explain to Sait\u0027s younger brother and sister that they will never see him again. We are shocked and paralysed by grief and pain and it rips me apart every day. I will never see Sait grow into a man, get married or have children. This has all been taken from him, not in a tragic accident but in a callous act of brutality. I have been unable to sleep or eat properly since his death as the memories of that terrible night keep coming back to me. My family feel every bit of grief I feel. The sense of loss is unbearable. We are heartbroken and will remain so.  I do not know why they wanted to harm him. Those in the dock have shown no remorse and disregard for the safety of my son and they have shown they do not care if my son lived or died. They have shown a callous disregard. Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, said: These are young men who are clearly trying to use the videos to establish their status as a Manchester gang. They shared the common purpose of using deadly violence against them with the weapons which they were carrying. The violence they used was extreme. They did not care whether their victims lived or died. Sait, a talented young footballer, was targeted in a cul-de-sac in Moss Side, Manchester in August last year when he was returning home from a shopping trip with friends. The jury heard he was struck by the Fiat and stabbed. He died of blood loss in hospital.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found around one third of the nation ignore money saving advice and make no attempt to reduce their monthly bills. The research of 2,000 bill-payers also revealed many of the common misconceptions around energy saving, including the fact 43 per cent believe energy-saving light bulbs have little or no impact on their bills. It also emerged one fifth think appliances don’t use electricity in standby mode, and more than 80 per cent think power showers use less water than baths. Ed Madden, head of marketing at npower which commissioned the research, said: “With energy, as with many other things in life, little things can have a big impact.  “A small change to your home habits may not make a massive difference alone but a few changes over a long time could not only help with your bills, but have a positive influence on the environment too.” Additionally three quarters of those surveyed consider themselves to be conscious of their energy consumption, but 37 per cent of bill-payers admit to leaving appliances on standby. Twenty eight per cent confess to boiling the kettle with more water than is required, 27 per cent have left lights on in empty rooms, whilst more than a fifth are guilty of falling asleep in front of the TV.  When asked to identify the biggest energy wasters in the home, a third of those polled blamed their partner, while one fifth of parents pointed the finger at their children. Madden added: “We’re hoping that busting some of these common myths might help the nation become a little more conscious of their energy consumption. “And there are other ways to save energy too – installing a Smart meter or seeing if you can save money by switching your tariff are easy wins.” The study also revealed one in four Brits have been misled by common energy myths.  Npower has teamed up with Karyn Fleeting, founder of popular money-saving blog, Miss Thrifty, to uncover ways to save cash in the home. Karyn said: “What this confirms is the UK\u0027s appetite for energy-saving advice and money-saving tips. “For the last 10 years, I have been on a mission to help the nation save money and spend smartly. “One thing I have discovered is that even the smallest of modifications to household habits can make a significant dent in household bills. “One minute less in the shower every day can save you up to \u0026pound80 per year. A washing-up bowl can save you up to \u0026pound25 a year.

Shortly afterwards, Alison and design engineer husband Carl, 34, saw their son receive a donor heart. They are now backing our Change the Law for Life campaign, which will see a new opt out law on organ donation introduced in 2020.  And they are raising awareness of the Sick Children\u0027s Trust, the charity which provided a hospital flat for them and the twins. Our situation was similar to that of Max and his family, said Alison,who works in youth justice. Charlie was healthy. Then out of the blue you are told he is extremely poorly and may need a new heart within two days of seeing your GP. We then had to go to Newcastle, and it was a whirlwind. For several days, she was unable to see her son. It was fine most of the time, but I did get flu between Christmas and New Year. I was banished from seeing Charlie for a few days due to the risk of infection, she recalled. They have adult accommodation for tranplant patients and I had to go in there.I was in a flat in my own, and during that time he took a massive dip and ended up in intensive care.

Parents are more reluctant to give the go-ahead for a transplant, with just 48% of those for under-17s agreeing. That compares to an average of 66% of relatives of people of all ages. This means children needing an urgent heart transplant will wait two-and-a-half times as long as adults. In the past three years 46 children have died on the waiting list. Of these 30 were waiting for a heart or lung transplant. Harry Clarke, who turns eight months old during Organ Donation Week, is at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital with a heart condition.  His parents Kerrie and Rob have uprooted their lives in Birmingham to be by Harry’s side while he is treated for dilated cardiomyopathy. They know that their only hope will be the parents of another child saying “yes” to organ donation at a time of personal tragedy. Kerrie said: “We would hope that family can look at it as an \u0026shyopportunity for their heart to live on through our son. Looking at him without his wires, you wouldn’t know he was ill some days. “Until you go through this and see how many babies are suffering, considering organ donation \u0026shyprobably doesn’t cross your mind but it’s important to have those conversations.” The figures are revealed by NHS Blood and Transplant to mark Organ Donation Week. For many children on the waiting list a young donor is their only hope. Hearts and lungs need to be matched by size because of the limited space inside the chest.

Mum-of-two Aimee Louise Evans was found dead at her home on Saturday, April 7. But when police arrived at the property in Port Talbot, south Wales, they found her daughter struggling to survive. The inquest heard the 28-year-old was found hanged in a bedroom. PC Clive Morris, of South Wales Police , told the inquest in Swansea on Wednesday that Ms Evans\u0027 three-year-old daughter was also in the house and was looking unkempt.  Mr Morris said, according to Wales Online : I became increasingly aware of the three-year-old\u0027s wellbeing – the child had been there for three to four days and she was unkempt. She was taken to hospital to be checked by a paediatrician. PC Morris said police believed the little girl survived by eating loaves of bread and some butter. Ms Evans\u0027 son was staying with his father at the time. PC Morris said Ms Evans had sent a text to her mum, Julie Evans, on Wednesday, April 4.  She had asked her to collect her daughter because she was ending it, to which Julie Evans replied by saying do not be daft and asking her daughter what the matter was. That was the last time the two of them spoke, PC Morris added, with Julie Evans repeatedly trying to make contact with her daughter over the following days, including visiting the property, but getting no reply. The inquest heard the single mum was last seen alive on April 3 when she went to her mum\u0027s house. She had been drinking, but wasn\u0027t drunk, and was checking the Facebook profile of a man she had been seeing on and off. PC Morris said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Ms Evans\u0027 death, adding that she had no history of mental health problems.  The inquest heard the mum-of-two used to drink most evenings and had been subject to domestic violence in previous relationships. PC Morris said: Her mum said Aimee was a happy, outgoing individual that showed no signs of depression. She said her children were always well cared for – that they were were always clean, tidy, and well looked after. This is one of the hardest cases I have dealt with. Senior coroner Colin Phillips said the post-mortem examination report found the cause of death to be hanging with the toxicology report showing a level of 137mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.

John sadly died at the hotel and Susan passed away at a nearby hospital on the same day.

Thomas Cook today said it is likely that the presence of e-coli and staphylococcus would explain the raised level of illness reported among guests at the hotel during this time, supporting their earlier decision to remove 300 customers. However, neither their independent specialists nor independent expert Doctor Vanya Gant believe these results shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of Mr and Mrs Cooper. The results of the autopsies being conducted by the Egyptian authorities are being awaited. Thomas Cook said the results showed something went wrong in August at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada though, and that standards fell below what they expect from hotel partners. Tests were carried out across the hotel after specialists were granted access by Steigenberger Aqua Magic.  However, the specialists were unable to access the Coopers\u0027 hotel room, which has remained under the control of the Egyptian authorities due to their ongoing investigation. The examination of air and water quality came back clear, Thomas Cook said. There was no evidence of carbon monoxide and there were normal carbon dioxide levels in the vicinity of the room, they added. Results also showed normal levels of chlorine in the swimming pools. The tests did not identify the presence of shigella, listeria or salmonella.

At least one person has been killed and at least 120 injured while 32 remain missing after homes were engulfed following the 6.7 magnitude tremor. A landslide along a long ridge in the rural town of Atsumi could be seen in aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK. Aerial footage showed dozens of landslides exposing barren hillsides near the town of Atsuma in southern Hokkaido, with mounds of reddish earth and fallen trees piled up at the edge of green fields. The collapsed remains of what appeared to be houses or barns were scattered about. The entire island was without power after Hokkaido Electric Power Co said it conducted an emergency shutdown of all its fossil fuel-fired power plants following the quake.  The utility said it wasn\u0027t clear when electricity would be restored to 2.95 million households. The trade and industry ministry told the utility to restart the coal-fired Tomato-Atsuma power plant within a few hours, Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said. All trains across the island were also halted. Roof tiles and water could be seen on the floor at Hokkaido\u0027s main airport, New Chitose Airport, which would be closed for at least Thursday. New Chitose is a major tourist gateway to the island, known for its mountains, lakes and abundant farmland and seafood, and more than 200 flights and 40,000 passengers would be affected, Kyodo News Agency said. The closure comes just a couple days after Kansai Airport, an important hub for companies exporting semiconductors near Osaka, in western Japan, was shut after it was hit by Typhoon Jebi.   The quake, which struck at 3.08am local time  posed no tsunami risk, the Japan Meteorological Agency  said. The US Geological Survey said it struck some 68 km  southeast of Sapporo, Hokkaido\u0027s main city.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6am, told reporters his government had set up a command centre to coordinate relief and rescue. His voice sounding haggard, Abe said saving lives was his government\u0027s top priority. The Tomari Nuclear Power Station suffered a power outage but was cooling its fuel rods safely with emergency power, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.  Operator Hokkaido Electric Power Co reported no radiation irregularities at the plant, which has been shut since shortly after a massive 2011 earthquake, Suga told a news conference. A fire broke out at a Mitsubishi Steel Mfg Co plant in the city of Muroran but has largely been brought under control, NHK said, quoting local officials. A row of houses could be seen slanting at odd angles, leaning against one another in one town, while roof tiles and water covered floors at New Chitose Airport.  Many schools were closed, and some 2.95 million homes were without power, NHK said. A series of smaller shocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.4, followed the initial temblor, the Meteorological Agency said. Agency official Toshiyuki Matsumori, at a early morning news conference, warned residents to take precautions for potential major aftershocks in coming days. Shinkansen bullet trains were halted in some areas of Hokkaido, NHK said. NHK Footage showed a crumbled brick wall and broken glass in a home, and quoted local police as saying some people were trapped in collapsed structures. Soldiers were shown looking for damage on a rural road that was blocked by fallen trees. Japan, situated on the Ring of Fire arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin, accounts for about 20 percent of the world\u0027s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

Jevh Maravilla and Christian Toledo were so frustrated with what they felt was a lack of Asian representation in the fast food giant\u0027s advertising the students took a picture of themselves eating a McDonald\u0027s burger and fries. And Jevh, of Filipino heritage, edited the photo to mimic the style of the posters at the restaurant, added an iconic yellow logo and had the image professionally printed. Jevh, of Houston, Texas, said: We all deserve equality and all races deserve recognition. I don\u0027t know why McDonald\u0027s marketing didn\u0027t include Asians, but often in the media Asian men are not shown as masculine and Asian women are just portrayed as cute and pretty.  When I was growing up, Asian people only appeared in movies as martial artists or funny side characters. We took the photo outside the neighbourhood events centre while a Zumba class was going on.  A video, which has gone viral , shows Jevh put on a McDonald\u0027s uniform he bought from a thrift shop, add a name badge and pose as Jeff Bergara with the title of regional interior coordinator to pull off an audacious stunt.   I wore a jacket covering my uniform and waited until the coast was clear from any employees, the brazen student told The Independent .     Once the coast was clear, I would take off my jacket and I would tell Christian and Cassandra [Batang, another friend who was helping] how to position it. And the determined pals waited for more than an hour before swiftly sticking the poster on a wall in their favourite branch. They ensured they did not vandalise the property by using an adhesive on July 13. Mission accomplished. It was all so very exciting, Jevh said.

Rolf Buchholz now has an astonishing 516 modifications, and even plans to add more, having had his first aged 50. He is among the weird and wonderful recordbreakers to feature in the latest Guinness Book of World Records, which is published today. The 59-year-old, from Dortmund in Germany, said he “started with tattoos and piercings, and added: I liked it and I did more and more.” And he continued: “It is so great to be in the book. It is something special. I am very proud to be in the book.” He has the most body modifications of any man in the world, according to the records. Other unusual entries in the book include... Most fire-breathing backflips in one minute  Ryan Luney, 22, learned to do backflips when he was eight, but has since added an extreme element of danger to his craft. And he earned a place in the records by completing 14 backflips in just 60 seconds. A statement from Guinness World Records said: Ryan Luney first learned how to fire breathe after being approached to perform in a show in Belfast. The show had trained fire breathers who taught Luney the basics of the skill. Luney then bough the necessary materials and regularly practiced his skills. Soon after, Luney was searching for his next world record attempt. He decided on doing the most fire breathing backflips in one minute after seeing someone do a single fire breathing backflip on TV. He figured this record would combine his two talents: fire breathing and parkour. World\u0027s oldest performing trapeze artist  Also making the list was Betty Goedhart, who at 84 became the world\u0027s oldest performing flying trapeze artist. A statement said: From a young age, Betty has always believed that she could accomplish anything with hard work and determination – which is why she began trapeze classes at the age of 78. Fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart  And Brit Tom Bagnall, 26, achieved the fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart, reaching a terrifying 112.29mph. Highest jump by a dog  A dog named Feather, from Maryland in the US, set a new record for the highest jump by a canine - by leaping 191.7cm, hitting her basement ceiling. Owner Samantha Valle, 31, who adopted her from a rescue centre, said: “Sometimes it takes a certain person to come along and see the potential in a dog to make them even greater. Most double-Dutch style skips by a dog    Another record-breaking pet is Geronimo, a female Border Collie and Kelpie cross, who has set the record for most double Dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, achieving an incredible 128. She was proving difficult to train, according to her owner, until she had a go on a skipping rope. Oldest professional club DJ  And at 83 years, 188 days, Sumiko Iwamuro is the oldest professional club DJ. Performing as DJ Sumirock, the restaurant owner said she loves “doing something totally different is energising”. Longest knitting needles created  Another Brit to make the book is artist Elizabeth Bond, who created 4.4metre knitting needles for an exhibition. After learning she has set a world record, the 31-year-old, from Wiltshire, said: “Everybody has potential if you just keep striving and pushing forward. Give it a go, what’s the worst that can happen?” Largest rideable hexapod robot  And Matt Denton, from Winchester, now holds a record for creating the world\u0027s largest rideable hexapod robot, which is 2.8m tall and 5m wide.

Sinead McNamara died despite desperate attempts to save her , after being found in a critical condition on the \u0026pound108 million boat.  The 20-year-old, who had 27,000 followers on the social network, had been out dancing and drinking with friends in Argostoli, on the Greek island of Kefalonia, hours before her death. Ms McNamara, from Australia, died on her way to hospital in Athens.  According to CNN , Coroner Elias Boyiokas said there were no visible signs of struggle or physical abuse, although marks from the rope were found on her neck.   The coroner continued: It is not yet possible to say if she was psychologically pushed to act or was under the influence of drugs at the time. But toxicology results are still likely to take several weeks. Ms McNamara was found tangled in ropes on the rear deck of the Mayan Queen IV yacht, but her death remains a mystery. She had been working on the \u0026pound108million boat - owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Baill\u0026egraveres - as a member of crew for just four months. A PR company representing his businesses has declined to comment on her death.  She is reported to have spoken to a security guard 15 minutes before the boat\u0027s captain found her at about 1.45am last Friday. Authorities said initial evidence pointed to the possibility of suicide, but an investigation into her death has been launched. The young woman\u0027s body is due to be flown back to Australia today, and it is expected to be accompanied by her mother Kylie and her sister Lauren. They had already flown in from Australia and were due to meet Ms McNamara on the day she died to go on holiday together. The Instagram star, who was originally from Port Macquarie and lived in Sydney, arrived in Greece in mid-June this year after travelling to Bali, Alaska and the Whitsundays.  Her brother, Jake, confirmed his sister\u0027s death on Saturday. I have unfortunately received the worst news of my life, [Sinead] has passed away, he posted to social media. According to local media, billionaire Mr Bailleres left the yacht, which was anchored off the island of Kefalonia, on Tuesday - leaving Ms McNamara alone with the crew. What happened in the 48 hours after his departure in the lead up to Miss McNamara\u0027s death is now the subject of an inquiry by local authorities.

I reckon Dundee have a real gem.“He went on to the pitch and scored straight-away, which was a terrific way to introduce himself.”There was little time to rest for the 19-year-old signed from Huddersfield in January.On Monday, he was in action for the Dark Blues’ second string as they chalked up a 4-0 success over Rangers in the Reserve League.He came off the bench to score after replacing Sofien Moussa, who also got on the scoresheet.Elton Ngwatala and Jean Mendy got the other goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4c332c791-432x564.jpg ","title":"dundee locals dig deep for loved pooch mr chang after vital operation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents are rallying round to help fund a vital operation for a tiny dog who has captured the hearts of a community.Pekingese Mr Chang is recovering from an operation he had for a slipped disc.It was feared he would have been left paralysed had the surgery not gone ahead.After owner Michelle Boyack forked out £3,600 for the operation at the Albavet Veterinary Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Lochee residents have been dipping into their pockets to help pay for it.A fundraising night is also set to take place at Club 83 in St Salvador Street next month.Michelle, 49, said: “My dog had to have an operation, which we were able to put off for a while.“In February, he basically had a slipped disc and he became quite poorly.“We thought we were going to need to pay out for the operation at that time but the vet said he just needed eight to 12 weeks cage rest and he ended up being OK.“However, three weeks ago he suffered a relapse and we had to pay the £3,600 to get him sorted out.“The vet said that he could have been paralysed if he didn’t have the surgery so we’re quite lucky.“He’s recovering now and he’s a big part of the community here in Lochee, people love him.”Michelle, who runs Short Bark and Tails in the High Street, had to use her daughter’s credit card to pay the bill for the two-year-old pooch’s treatment.Mr Chang has quickly gained a host of admirers in Lochee with Michelle receiving regular visitors to her shop to help pay for the treatment.Michelle said she’s been overwhelmed by the support from people in the area.She added: “I’ve honestly felt like crying with some of the stuff I’ve seen and people coming in to give some money.“There’s a few people who I’m sure don’t really have much that have been coming in to give up their last fiver just because they love the dog so much.“He’s part of the community here but it’s still really a testament to Lochee that people are coming out and doing that. I’ve not long opened my business and I don’t have that money to spend but your pets are like your kids.“Lochee sometimes gets a bad rap but to see people coming in to give their bit is brilliant.“I’ve

over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s

chiefs.Dundee firm GI Residential had originally submitted plans to create 31 new homes on the site of the old Seaview Primary School in Monifieth, before withdrawing the application following discussions with Angus Council.Council planning officers had warned the company that the proposed three-storey newbuilds around the old school building were too high, and threatened to overshadow the category B-listed structure.Now GI Residential has resubmitted its application with proposals to build just 27 homes – seven of them inside the former school building – and scale down the size of the newbuilds.In its revised planning statement, the company said: “Following several meetings with Angus Council and following concerns raised about the initial proposal the design has been revised to address these proposals.“The utmost priority of the development has been working towards saving the existing listed building which is in a very poor state of disrepair and continues to deteriorate.“The applicant has undertaken rigorous and detailed development costs and the reduction in numbers represents the minimum level of reduction for the viability of the project.“The reductions have been made working with the planning department and the further reductions will go significantly in addressing the previous concerns.“The current revised application represents a chance for a failing listed building to be saved.“The proposed solution discussed with the planning department is to reduce the blocks down to two storeys to allow the existing listed building to dominate the skyline, and to create three blocks designed around ‘courtyards’ – placing one of the blocks further south.”Under the new plans, the old school will be converted into seven units. The new blocks A and B will still be two storeys but sit lower than the eaves of the school building, containing a combined 16 housing units.Block C will have four two-bed apartments set over two storeys.There will be a total of 54 car parking spaces.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d5611cad-e1536054160536-814x564.jpg ","title":"no excuses for display at alloa says dundee united midfielder adam barton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United midfielder Adam Barton insists they can have no excuses for their poor performance at Alloa despite the tough conditions.The Terrors drew 1-1 with Jim Goodwin’s side on Saturday in a game they were expected to win.The synthetic surface at the Indodrill Stadium was narrowed for United’s visit and the hosts made life difficult for Csaba Laszlo’s men throughout.Despite opening the scoring through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, as well as enjoying some bright spells in the second half, the Wasps were always in control.A sublime Iain Flannigan free-kick earned Alloa a well-deserved point and it could’ve been more.Barton said: “If we want to win the league, these are the places you’ve got to go and do the job.“What frustrates me is people on the outside, particularly the fans, who were there in good numbers on Saturday. They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"poll results dundee fans give clear verdict on whether neil mccann should stay as manager","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans have given a clear message to the board regarding the future of manager Neil McCann.The Tele yesterday ran an online poll asking fans if McCann deserves more time to turn things round after at Dens a terrible start to the season.His position as Dundee manager is coming under increased scrutiny after his side lost for the fifth match running on Saturday.The Dark Blues went down 3-1 at home to Motherwell – and it could have been a lot worse.The Dee sit bottom of the table without a point and have twice been beaten by lower league opposition in the Betfred Cup.McCann is correct when he says his team had a similarly bad opening to last season’s campaign before recovering to finish safely in ninth place.However, less than one in five supporters shared his optimism as 80% of Dundee fans who voted in our online poll called for him to be dismissed after 17 months in the hot seat.Of the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time was up.One of our readers wrote: \u0026#8220His tactics and player recruitment have not been good enough.\u0026#8220There is no passion in his players, they were second best against a Motherwell side who chased and harried for everything throughout the match.\u0026#8220He should do the gentlemanly thing and resign and realise he is a better pundit than a manager.\u0026#8221Just 312 people felt he deserved more time.One wrote: \u0026#8220He is still a rookie and there are worse teams in the league.\u0026#8221McCann has time to regroup his players during the international break before a trip to Rangers, one of his former clubs, a week on Saturday.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil mccann leaves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee supporters have revealed who they want to take over if Neil McCann leaves the club.Five straight defeats at the start of the season have heaped pressure on the current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116827.jpg","title":"City centre eyesore gets demolition approval","story":"\u0026nbspTHE owners of a fire-ravaged building blighting Inverness city centre will meet Highland Council representatives this week to set out a timetable of work after the go-ahead was given for its demolition.Hopes are growing of a breakthrough in the impasse over the former Eastgate Hostel which has been an eyesore since going up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash some 1984 days ago \u0026ndash although the council has acknowledged a compulsory purchase order could be considered if an agreement is not reached.Public frustration has been growing over the lack of visible action at the site.A planning application was lodged with the council earlier this year to remove scaffolding and demolish the remaining structure ahead of reconstruction. But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

boost","story":"\u0026nbspSHOPPERS could soon be using a new method to make their purchases in the centre of Inverness with the city\u0027 own gift card.Inverness Business Improvement District  has been looking at the possibility of introducing a gift card which can be used at Bid member businesses and encourage more people to support their local economy.Bid manager Mike Smith confirmed the idea was under consideration and he would be reporting to the board on the proposal within the next few weeks.He said: \"There is a fair degree of investment involved and risk attached because you have to meet the cost of setting the whole thing up and there are different ways of doing it.\"But it is something we will have a look at because we need to encourage engagement with our businesses.\"A gift card scheme was launched in Elgin earlier this year by the town\u0027 own Bid, known as Elgin Embrace, and has attracted interest from Inverness.It is one of more than 20 towns and cities around the UK using a gift card developed by former Highland resident Colin Munro and his company Miconex.Perth, the West End district of Glasgow, Sheffield and Cardiff are among the locations which have set up their own schemes.Some 70 businesses, including national chains and local independents, have signed up to the Elgin gift card.However, Elgin Embrace manager Gill Neill warned that a successful gift card scheme required a large initial investment.\"We did it on behalf of all our members because it is an incredibly expensive programme to put together,\" she said.\"Set up costs are in the region of \u0026pound20,000, so you will find that most of the town gift cards are being run by business improvement districts on behalf of their membership.\"The businesses in the town have been really, really responsive and really positive, but I think a big part of that is we are covering the costs.\"I strongly suspect that if we had not and had been asking people to pay, you would not have had the same uptake.\"The initiative has also been well received by shoppers in the town.\"The public see it as a very positive thing,\" she added.\"Rather than being given a specific gift card that they use in one shop, they get an Elgin Gift Card that they can used in one of the 70 places in the town.\"They can use it to buy clothes, get their hair done, have a meal or put it towards a holiday or buying furniture.\"People are still very positive about embracing the Shop Local message and we hope this will encourage people to perhaps visit businesses they have never used before.\"From the point of view of what a Bid is trying to do, it\u0027 meeting its aim.\"Inverness Chamber of Commerce president Liam Christie sees the prospective Inverness card as a good move for the Highland capital.\"It\u0027 a good way of getting people back into the city centre,\" he said.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:36

worries","story":"HIGHLAND Council chiefs are bashing out revised proposals to defer spending, accelerate savings and \u0026ldquorestructure recruitment to avert a \u0026pound5.1 million budget overspend.A bitter political row overshadowed a resources committee debate on it. Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face.

online wishing her cocker spaniel Murphy a happy 18th birthday – 126 in dog years – and was soon contacted by Ron Bird who claimed to own the pooch’s sister.After a short chat they established that his dog Honey was indeed bought from the same Blackburn breeder.Now the canine siblings have been reunited – an event, Ron says, which brought on “a rollercoaster of emotions”.Lynne, who lives in Hatton of Fintray with husband Charlie, 41, and daughters Ashleigh, 11, and Jessica, 9, said: “It was Murphy’s 18th birthday, and we were really proud and really excited about it, so I put up a post on Facebook.”Ron, 66, of Bonnyview Drive, in Aberdeen, said: “Someone tagged me in a Facebook post, so I contacted Lynne and when we discovered that they were brother and sister I was just overwhelmed.“I was welling up, it was a real rollercoaster of emotions.“To find out that she had a brother at such an elderly age was gobsmacking.”For Lynne, the resemblance was uncanny.She said: “Their colour and their hair and the shape of their face, it was the same.“I know that dogs look the same, but it was just like looking at Murphy.”Ron added: “They’re both very old now, and cocker spaniels are known for their nose, so their eyes and ears have deteriorated and they can’t really see each other.”Murphy and Honey have both had their share of health problems.Lynne said it was “touch and go” last year after Murphy lost the use of his back legs following a “spinal stroke”, where a clot interferes with spinal cord blood flow.She said: “He couldn’t walk, so we rushed him to the vet and luckily got some medication, which he’s still on.“Now he’s back up on all four legs – he’s made a miraculous recovery.”Honey hasn’t had an easy ride of it either, with Ron suspecting that she has had a series of small strokes too.Lynne said the dogs’ ages meant the reunion was a sedate affair.She said: “Because they’re so old, they were just sitting together.“There wasn’t really a big hoo-ha about it. We were probably more excited about them than they were.“They were just cuddled up together.

Far too many cars leave the road, cross the footpath and hit the banking, with some having gone through the fencing to end up in the gardens of houses in St Michael’s Road. Others have hit lampposts.“Luckily no one has been seriously injured. And apparently that is the problem for Transport Scotland. But vehicles are still coming off the road. I would rather an investigation took place now before people are injured or killed.”The issue has been followed up by north-east MSP Mike Rumbles.In a response from Transport Scotland, road safety manager Derek Williamson said: “Road safety is of paramount importance to the Scottish Government.“Transport Scotland assess the safety performance of the trunk road network on an annual basis by screening all locations where three or more personal injury accident patterns occur and rates in the form of Route Accident Reduction Plans . In recent years, this location has not been identified as a site for concern from our annual road safety review.“I appreciate there have been a number of incidents involving vehicles leaving the carriageway.

My preference is it will get started as soon as possible and we will do as much as we can to make that happen.“We have to work with the contractors who will do the work.“I would love to give you a guarantee it will be started in the next couple of months.”Construction has yet to start, however without a spade yet hitting the ground it is feared it may be impossible for the ambitious project to be completed within the estimated 18 to 24-month timeframe.SNP group leader Stephen Flynn previously said meeting the timescales would “simply not happen” and that even the provisional summer 2020 completion date looks unlikely.Mr Lumsden said he was “not sure” if there was a delay to the overall project but added 2020 was the “timetable they are working towards”.He added: “I’m not sure if there is a delay.“It depends on what the contractors come back with.“For the opposition to say there’s delays is a bit irresponsible – they have members on the planning committee.“They know that if it was only approved in March.“It was approved then because we took into consideration the feedback from the stakeholders.“That’s why planning took a bit longer than expected.”A number of high-profile council projects have been delayed in recent years, including revamps of Broad Street, the art gallery, Provost Skene’s House and the Central Library.London Olympic Park architects LDA Design won planning permission for their Union Terrace Gardens plan in March.The multi-million-pound proposals include new walkways, an amphitheatre and a cafe.The proposals aim to conserve the Victorian park’s heritage and to “sustain Aberdeen’s performance in times of economic difficulty”, according to a design statement.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"chief its almost like european tie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tColin Grant says he never thought he would see the day when Formartine United were facing a team from another country.On Saturday evening the Pitmedden team will be in Northern Ireland to take on Coleraine in the Irn-Bru Challenge Cup second round.For Grant, who has spent 30 years as president at North Lodge Park, the clash with the Bannsiders is another step on an incredible journey with United.When he came on board in 1988 the club were close to folding and were struggling.But over the years they have been revitalised with Saturday’s tie against foreign opposition another step on Formartine’s journey following their promotion to the Highland League in 2009.Grant said: “I never thought I would see the club involved in something like this.“We’re a Highland League club so for us this is almost a European tie.“It’s phenomenal, the experience for us will be incredible.“It gives the club publicity. Regardless of the result there are people at Irish newspapers trying to find out about Formartine United.“I said after we won the Aberdeenshire Cup last season that it was another step on our journey.“This is the same for us, it’s another tick in the box.“Thirty years ago when I came on board the doors could have been locked.“Now we are playing what for a Highland League team is a European tie in another country.“It’s phenomenal what we are doing. Many people call us the small pub team from Pitmedden, but it’s phenomenal.”Coleraine are one of Northern Ireland’s top sides. They are top of the Premiership, unbeaten domestically this season.Last term they finished second in the league and won the Irish Cup for the first time in 15 years.Earlier this season Oran Kearney’s team played Spartak Subotica of Serbia in the Europa League first qualifying round, losing 3-1 on aggregate.Grant believes Formartine are underdogs, but is hoping they can spring a surprise.He added: “They are a big team Coleraine, in many ways for us this game has a similar stature to playing a Premiership side in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.“This is a big tie, Coleraine were live on Sky on Tuesday night against Crusaders.“Sky show their league and back their league. We don’t have anything like that. This is a historic occasion for Formartine really.“We’ve got no expectations so if the boys go there and have a go you never know.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"joy-as-post-office-to-reopen-in-innerleithen","story":"INNERLEITHEN residents will be able to pick up some fruit and veg with their stamps when their new Post Office opens its doors this week.\nThe Allotment \u0026ndash on the town\u0026rsquos High Street, will open its new Post Office concession to customers on Wednesday.\nThe shop is 60 metres from the previous Post Office at the Daymart newsagents along the street, which closed following the resignation of the postmaster in February 2017.\nThe closure sparked a long battle to bring the service back \u0026ndash with a controversial mobile outreach van operating in the interim.\nIn June, the good news was finally delivered after Post Office chiefs rubber stamped plans to return to the Tweeddale town on a full-time basis.\nThe Allotment store, which sells a range of fresh fruit and vegetables, opened in 2011.\nIt is run by business partners Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen.\nMeanwhile, the chairman of Innerleithen Community Council, Marshall Douglas, is looking forward to the opening.\nHe told the Peeblesshire News: \u0026ldquoWe were pleased to hear earlier this summer that the Post Office will return to Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoThis is a vital service, and it was a sad loss when the previous concession closed back in February last year.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to thank Susan Meikle for her wonderful work in bringing this essential store back to the town.\nThe store will offer a number of Post Office products and services throughout its opening hours from 10am to 5pm Monday to Friday, and 9.30am to 1pm on Saturdays.

Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

safety record continuing to be one of the poorest across the UK, FSPS is encouraging those working within the industry to make safety a priority.FSPS, which consists of key industry stakeholders, will focus on different types of farming activities, each quarter, to deliver key messages and encourage those working and living on Scotland’s farms and crofts to take action.This week, the campaign, trailing on from Farm Safety Week in July, is urging people to make an active choice about their safety and will focus on the following between September and November: general maintenance on farm, falls from heights and safety at harvest.Last year there were 33 deaths in the agricultural industry in the UK, with five in Scotland.The most common causes of death in the agricultural industry continues to involve falls, transport, animals and equipment.Over the last five years 38 people have been killed in the UK by a moving vehicle 12 people have been killed by contact with machinery 10 have been killed by asphyxiation or drowning, including in grain stores or pits and slurry pits and eight people have been killed by contact with electricity.This data does not take into account the number of injuries on Scotland’s farms and crofts, a number that is believed to be significantly higher.For those amidst harvest, it is essential that they practice the ‘Safe Stop’ method when working with machinery, equipment and vehicles \u0026#8211 handbrake on, controls in neutral, engine off, keys out.Anyone working with equipment or machinery should also be appropriately trained, with full risk assessments carried out, particularly when working near power lines.Speaking on behalf of FSPS, NFU Scotland chief executive Scott Walker commented: \u0026#8216One death or injury on Scotland’s farms and crofts is frankly one too many and as an industry we need to take action to make a conscious effort to put our safety, and that of those living and working around us as a priority.\u0026#8216Whether it is carrying out maintenance to a roof, checking over a machine, or working in a field with power lines, injuries and deaths through accidents most of the time are preventable by taking simple steps and precautions.\u0026#8216This campaign encourages farmers and crofters to make a point of ensuring their working environment is safe, to help us work together to reduce the death and injury toll on our farms and crofts.\u0026#8216This autumn, it is about your Safety, your Choice, and as the darker nights draw in, and many are rushing to get the job done it is important to take a step back to make sure you are working safely.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter dogs are not sensible cycling accessories","story":"I was interested at your article

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station.

The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.

Former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill after being exposed to the military grade nerve agent Novichok in March.  The alleged perpetrators were identified in a dramatic joint police and Crown Prosecution Service press conference.  Detectives believe it is likely the pair, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names.  Prosecutors deem it futile to apply to Russia for the extradition of the two men, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half. News filtered through that Switzerland had been held by Poland and two minutes later Scotland had booked their place in the 2019 World Cup."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"  Owen McIntosh, 47, attacked banker Kevin Wall, 47, in front of his wife in a road rage incident when he was driving supporters home from a match.  Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my wife screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.  He was acquitted on a second charge of driving dangerously by overtaking when it was unsafe to so and colliding with the rear of Mr Wall\u0027s car.

For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8535346.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ex-celtic-striker-slammed-for-calling-himself-king-of-glasgow-after-switch-to-france","story":"  The forward got bombarded after posting his Twitter message after completing a transfer to French club Lyon for \u0026pound20m.

She will face a courtroom cross-examination next year after a sheriff gave the green light for a full hearing.  The row started after Mr Campbell, who runs the controversial Wings Over Scotland website, tweeted about Tory MSP Oliver Mundell. His father, the Tory Scottish Secretary David Mundell, came out as gay in 2016.  Mr Campbell wrote last year: \u0026ldquoOliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner.\"  In a newspaper column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets.  Mr Campbell\u0026rsquos legal team argue her article was defamatory and implied he is homophobic.  It is understood the UK Labour Party, which raised a record income of \u0026pound56 million last year, will pay all Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal costs in the upcoming court battle.  It has instructed London-based lawyers Steel \u0026amp Shamash, who have in turn enlisted Scottish firm Balfour+Manson.  Mr Campbell said Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence costs were being paid by a \"shady\", unidentified backer in an article he published over the weekend.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoNOT by an open public crowdfunder, where thousands of ordinary people kick in a modest few quid of their own free will, not even out of the money she grabbed by leveraging her modest fame and power to abandon her constituents and go on a celebrity TV show, but by a shady backer who hasn\u0026rsquot been officially identified, isn\u0026rsquot answerable to anyone, and isn\u0026rsquot available to ordinary members of the public.  He was condemning opposition attacks on Alex Salmond, who launched a crowdfunding appeal to bankroll his legal battle with the Scottish Government over its handling of sexual harassment allegations.  Responding to Labour paying Ms Dugdale\u0027s court fees, Mr Campbell said: \"After a full week of Scottish Labour bleating loudly about how Alex Salmond should have paid his own legal costs, the hypocrisy of this would be \u0026ndash well, it\u0027d be about what I\u0027d expect, to be honest.\"  Ms Dugdale was criticised earlier this year after it emerged she received more than her annual salary as an MSP for less than two weeks on ITV\u0026rsquos I\u0026rsquom a Celebrity\u0026hellip Get Me Out of Here!

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed.  As a result a national campaign was launched involving teaching unions, parent bodies and charities to encourage parents to opt out.  The move resulted in confusion over whether families had such a right because, while councils have a wider legal duty to provide education, the curriculum itself is not enshrined in legislation - meaning parents don\u0027t have a specific legal right to opt out.  The joint letter from the Scottish Government and Ades, the body which represents education directors, said the assessments should be seen as a key tool to inform teachers of the needs of pupils.  It adds: \"The ... assessments, in common with virtually all aspects of the Scottish curriculum and its delivery, are not provided for in legislation.  \"This means that they cannot be seen as compulsory, but also that there cannot be a legal right for parents to withdraw their children from the assessments, or indeed any other part of the school curriculum with the exception of some parts of religious observance and instruction.  \"In practice, however, should any parents or carers have any particular concerns about their child\u0026rsquos participation ... they should discuss this with their school with a view to reaching agreement on whether the child will undertake the assessments.\"  The Educational Institute of Scotland  teaching union, which has opposed testing in P1, questioned whether delivery of the assessments fell under the terms of a wider legal duty on councils to provide education.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary, said: \"This letter incorrectly suggests there is a legal duty on local authorities to deliver the Scottish assessments.  \"It also overstates the educational value of assessments, contrary to the weight of evidence supplied by our members.\"  Mr Flanagan said the EIS supported the \"absolute right\" of parents to opt children out through a request to their school or local authority.  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, which is leading the opt out campaign, said the guidance clarified the right of parents to withdraw.  She said: \"If the assessments aren\u0027t compulsory, parents are obviously entitled to withdraw their children. This is especially the case in P1 where they are unlikely to be of any use and have proved distressing for some children.  \"The most sensible course of action would be to drop the P1 tests immediately and consult with teaching unions and others on the best way forward for the P4 and P7 tests.\"  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, which has backed the opt-out campaign, said: \"This letter confirms that these tests are not compulsory. That is all we need to know.  \"If they are not compulsory, then parents can discuss their concerns with their schools and can withdraw their child from the P1 test. I am sure no school would want to force a child or a parent into a situation which might cause distress.\"  Last week, the Scottish Government was accused of \u0026lsquomisleading\u0026rsquo parents in a letter from a top civil servant over the right to opt out.  Graeme Logan, a deputy director in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos learning directorate, sent a letter to councils stating parents did not have the right to opt out apart from \u0026ldquoexceptional circumstances quoting advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland .

But the TUC says its analysis shows that the pressure on household budgets has in fact increased under her government, pushing the JAMs \u0026ldquoeven closer to the financial cliff-edge.  Since Q4 2016 to Q1 2018, the report highlights how families\u0026rsquo outgoings have outstripped incomes in every quarter, resulting in a total household deficit of \u0026pound34 billion.  It notes how in 2017, the Office for National Statistics reported a calendar year shortfall of \u0026pound900 per household the first time in 30 years that the average household spent more than it brought in.  The analysis explains how in the 1980s \u0026ndash the last time families went into the red \u0026ndash household deficits were driven by high spending. However under the current Government, spending has grown by an average of just two per cent a year in the same period, real disposable incomes have declined at an annual rate of -0.4 per cent, driven by falling wages and insecure work.  \u0026ldquoIn other words, families are being forced to borrow simply to maintain a basic standard of living, declared the TUC.  ONS figures showed, it said, that the shortfall was concentrated across the poorest fifth of households with spending outstripping incomes in both the first and second deciles by income.  As a result, debt levels among the poorest households were rising extremely quickly. From 2015 to 2017, the [consumer credit] debt to income ratio for the poorest households rose from around 55 per cent to more than 100 per cent, according to the Centre for Responsible Credit and Jubilee Debt Campaign.  Frances Grady, the TUC General Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May has abandoned the promises she made when she moved into Downing Street.  \u0026ldquoTwo years on, working families can\u0026rsquot make ends meet without being forced into the red. And the May Government has done nothing to get wages rising or to crack down on the epidemic of insecure work.

Other parties are becoming virtuosos in the art of political division. The Conservatives are split at least three ways over Brexit, with their Prime Minister\u0026rsquos authority in ruins and Boris Johnson in open revolt. Labour is bitterly divided over anti-Semitism and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos leadership. The SNP isn\u0026rsquot: it realises that unity works.  With 125,000 members, the SNP is now the second largest party, not just in Scotland, but in the entire UK. Indeed, if the SNP membership were scaled up to UK level, it would have twice the UK Labour Party membership and 12 times that of the Tories. Such numbers might be expected in a radical opposition party, but not a long-in-the-tooth party of government.  Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon announced the 12th legislative programme since the SNP entered government in 2007. The SNP is now into its second decade in office, yet support appears actually to be rising again, according to YouGov, and is back to 40 per cent. This despite the widely-publicised problems with NHS waiting lists and poor performance in educational league tables. Nor has support for independence flagged, with one poll this week suggesting that, if Brexit happens, more Scottish voters are minded to support Yes than in 2014.  Ms Sturgeon appears to have seen off the threat from Richard Leonard\u0026rsquos newly-Corbynised Scottish Labour, and we are reliably informed that Ruth Davidson is now looking to a political future in Westminster. Much of this success is down not to the Scottish Government, which has made its share of mistakes, but to the resilience of the party itself. Yesterday\u0026rsquos programme was a workmanlike job with important measures on mental health, animal welfare and children\u0026rsquos rights, but it was essentially an addendum to last year\u0026rsquos offerings on tax and the environment. Everyone says Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos administration is looking tired, and in some respects it is. Truth be told, the Scottish Cabinet, Sturgeon aside, has never looked particularly dynamic. But the slide to political disfavour, widely predicted after 2017\u0026rsquos abortive referendum, hasn\u0026rsquot taken place. The party continues to break all the established rules of politics \u0026ndash the pendulum refuses to swing. This is largely because the SNP membership has turned party unity into an article of faith, and turned positive thinking to a potent political weapon.  It\u0026rsquos not as if the SNP lacks issues to split over. There\u0026rsquos Brexit for a start, upon which there are widely differing views. Some back Brexit, some back a People\u0026rsquos Vote against it, most are dismayed at the prospect and feeling powerless.  Ms Sturgeon can\u0026rsquot make up her mind on whether to support a People\u0026rsquos Vote, but unlike in the other main parties, no vociferous factions have emerged to persuade her either way.  Many SNP activists are desperate for an early independence referendum, and believe that if Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u0026rsquot announce one now, the chance might never come again. We have pro-independence marches wending through Scottish cities almost by the week. But Ms Sturgeon has pointedly declined to endorse them, and has given precious little sign of being about to call a referendum. In any normal party, there\u0026rsquod now be two warring camps, like the Leavers and Remainers of Brexit, on this existential question of independence. But not the SNP. You can almost sense it positioning itself for constructive disappointment, not open revolt. The great split over the referendum may never come.  Then there\u0026rsquos the Sustainable Growth Commission Report,with its dismal science of deficit reduction. That caused much dispute on the Scottish left, but the membership has refused to turn it into any recognisable left-right division in the party. There\u0026rsquos no Campaign for SNP Socialism. The will to unity is just too strong \u0026ndash as it has been in the backwash from the resignation of  Alex Salmond \u0026ndash a veritable god in the Nationalist pantheon, who has been cast out of the party after over 40 years.  The row over Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunding took place outside the SNP. Faced with the extraordinary prospect of the former First Minister taking the Scottish Government to court, SNP members refused to turn what they see as a personal drama into a political crisis. Many SNP women have concerns about victims of sexual harassment, and Mr Salmond isn\u0026rsquot universally popular, but they chose not to turn this difficult case into an intra-party gender war.  Labour and press commentators often talk about the SNP\u0026rsquos almost unnatural unity as if it is centrally enforced. As if there is some dictatorial party secretariat imposing rigid discipline and suppressing debate. Either that, or the SNP is a \u0026ldquocult, they say, in which star-crossed believers lose their ability to disagree. In truth, it is neither: the SNP is just damned if it will give the hated \u0026ldquomainstream media stories about splits, so it keeps it in the family.  It wasn\u0026rsquot always so. The SNP used to be notorious for its squabbles and divisions. Mr Salmond was expelled from the party in 1979 for leading a left-wing faction. And the party was deeply divided over devolution in the 1990s. It learned the hard way that unity works. Rather like the Tartan Army, the SNP has found a way to insulate itself emotionally from the disillusion and despondency that afflict most political parties once they starts governing in prose. This is what has prevented the Scottish Government from lapsing into mid-term doldrums and disarray. For its many thousands of members, the SNP has become, not so much a political party, more a way of life."},{"url":null,"title":"may-and-corbyn-clash-over-second-brexit-vote-at-prime-ministers-questions","story":"  The Prime Minister said she was clear that Britain would leave the European Union on March 29 2019.

Determined to realise the dream of owning her own farm, she defied expectations to tough out a Spartan existence on a blasted moorside, where farming had been abandoned.    In the summer, she had to contend with swarms of biting midges, while winter snow could see her holed up for five days at a time. There were ticks the size of a thumb nail which can suck the life out of a sheep, fatal Lyme disease caused by deer, and the dwindling financial return on sheep, which persuaded the previous tenants to give up.  But the resourceful Ms Gray took it in her stride, and was made of sterner stuff than the wilderness could throw at her.

While the women have qualified for their first ever\u0026nbspWorld Cup, it has been 20 years of hurt for Scotland\u0027s men who last reached a\u0026nbspWorld Cup proper in 1998, and even then only managed one draw before exiting after three group stage games.    No wonder people have been falling over themselves to acclaim the Scotland Women - including the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is a patron of the team.

And there will be a few of us planning to go to France next year.  \"I am of a certain vintage that says if the women qualify, then I am going.\"  He said that he felt the women appeared to show more pride in playing for their country than their male counterparts.    \"There are a few sceptics that are not convinced that many of the men take as much pride as the women do,\" he said.  \"Watch them singing the National Anthem, every single one of them does it. They show such commitment. That\u0027s what the fans demand of the men and I am not convinced that we get it.\"  Scottish Football Supporters Association director Paul Goodwin said interest in football amongst women had grown in the past ten years and there can only be an upward trajectory in the wake of the Scotland Women\u0027s success.  READ MORE:\u0026nbsp  He said that in the 60s he would be amazed to see a woman in the crowd at a football match in Scotland. At the last count, 2400 of their 30000 members were women.  When Scotland\u0027s Women beat their Swiss counterparts 2-1 at St Mirren Park last week, 4,098 attended, a record for one of their international matches.    Four years ago when Scotland won 2-0 against Poland at Fir Park, Motherwell in another vital World Cup qualifier, it attracted a crowd of 1551.  Just before the critical Albania game BBC Alba announced a set of new deals that would see the channel become the home of Scottish women\u0026rsquos football in a move that signalled a huge boost for the game\u0027s profile.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe deals include the live broadcast of any Scotland squad World Cup games in 2019.  \"We believe support for women\u0027s football will grow with this fantastic achievement and we have to build on that momentum,\" added Mr Goodwin.  \"More creative marketing should be put in to actually get more people to support the local women\u0027s teams \"There are people who will say that the standards are not the same as with the men\u0027s but it\u0027s like any sport it has to be seen in its own merits.  \"Nobody turns their nose up at [Scots middle-distance runner Laura Muir]. They don\u0027t say that the time she is running now is not as good as what Steve Cram managed in the 80s.\"    He said the fact the Scots team are playing in better teams in some of the biggest women\u0027s football leagues is having an impact.  \"If you look at where the men\u0027s game is, there are very few players in the English Premier League, they are mostly playing in the Championship [the second tier of English football]. But if you look at the women in European terms, they have players at Manchester United and Manchester City and it is playing at that higher level that is no doubt what is propelling them to the World Cup.\"  Alana Watson, who is also an SFSA director said that Shelley Kerr\u0027s Scots team will become role models for the young girls who are increasingly taking up the sport.  \"What they have done is a massive achievement at a time when the men\u0027s team has not qualified for an international tournament in the last 20 years. It shows that the standard of women\u0027s football in this country is going from strength to strength,\" said Ms Watson, who is a former coach.  \"Predominantly football is seen as a man\u0027s game so women are always going to be challenged to be recognised for their accomplishments in that field and with qualifying for the World Cup, that will hopefully change some people\u0027s views about it.  \"The numbers of, especially younger girls, who are involved in playing football and going along to a club and having that structured league that boys grow up with, that has definitely grown massively in the past decade, so for them to have role models who are women, who they can actually watch play football, that is going to inspire them even more.\"  She felt women\u0027s football was attracting those who prefer a more family friendly atmosphere - something they often do not get when attending a Scottish Premiership game.  \"There is less stigma surrounding the women\u0027s game,\" she said. \"That\u0027s why there are a lot of kids that like to go and watch women\u0027s football.\"  Chris Rawlings, Scottish FA\u0027s commercial director said in announcing the BBC Alba deal: \u0026ldquoThis is a partnership we are extremely excited about as the women\u0026rsquos and girls\u0026rsquo game in Scotland continues to develop.  \u0026ldquoHaving a guaranteed broadcast partner allows us to show all the women\u0026rsquos national team home matches which have proven to be an exciting entity.  \u0026ldquoThe record crowd of 4,098 at The Simple Digital Arena in Paisley proves the appetite is there to watch the women\u0026rsquos national team and this deal enables the nation to watch our games, when they can\u0026rsquot make it along to the stadium.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-calls-on-david-mundell-to-take-no-deal-brexit-scenario-off-the-table","story":"  Today, the Scottish Secretary is due to appear before Holyrood\u0026rsquos Finance and Constitution Committee to give evidence on the EU Withdrawal Act, which the Nationalists believe is a \u0026ldquopower-grab, a contention the UK Government strongly denies.

CHS will host an information event at the SCRA offices in Fraserburgh on Tuesday, September 11, at 7pm. The offices can be found at 10 Commerce Street.A second event will be held on Thursday, September 13 at 6pm in Woodhill House, Aberdeen.Boyd McAdam, National Convener of Children’s Hearings Scotland, said: “Children and young people attending hearings have told us that they want to see more diversity among Panel Members. In particular, they’re keen to see more young people to whom they can potentially relate when decisions are being made about their lives.“To ensure we are doing the very best for those who experience the hearings system, we feel it is important to recruit as many young people as possible to volunteer as Panel Members. In addition, this year we are also looking to recruit more men to the Panel and have a national target of around 200.”                                                                                                        Between April 2017 and March 2018, 32,553 children’s hearings took place supporting 14,076 vulnerable children and young people across Scotland at risk of neglect, abuse or who may be involved in the care system.Whilst children and young people can be referred to the Children’s Reporter for a range of different reasons, recently released statistics show that between April 2017 and March 2018, 85% of the cases referred were on the grounds of care and protection. This is the most common ground for referral for children under the age of one.Boyd added: “Panel Members are required to deal with a range of different cases in children’s hearings. These can often be very complex. We are looking for a diverse range of people who can engage with children and young people, make important and difficult decisions and importantly who can ensure that the rights of the child or young person in each hearing are respected.”The new CHS campaign will run for five weeks until the end of September.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print.

Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own life last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrifying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusThursday 6 Sep 2018 4:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 5, 2018 at 11:09 amThe public would like Orkney Islands Council to spend more of their reserves on improving community life in Orkney \u0026#8211 and is also willing to look at their communities taking on more responsibility for their local areas.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Both will take place on Friday, September 14, both beginning at 8am and running until 10am.Kirsty Brown, Scottish Sea Farms’ regulatory compliance coordinator for Orkney and organiser of the beach cleans, said: “Protecting the local environments in which we live and work is part and parcel of our everyday roles at Scottish Sea Farms. With these beach cleans we’re taking that commitment one step further, helping sweep our shorelines for litter and collate vital local data that will be fed back to the Marine Conservation Society.”“The results from previous years’ Great British Beach Cleans are thought to have been instrumental in bringing about environmental legislation such as the plastic bag charge and banning of microplastics in personal care products, so the more local faces that join in, the bigger the potential difference we can all make.”The Great British Beach Clean is organised by the Marine Conservation Society  and takes place annually in September.Scottish Sea Farms are looking for volunteers to take part in their effort.They have asked anyone planning to join in to should register, via https:www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/events/gbbc, and should wear appropriate clothing with pickers, gloves and bags to be provided.The meeting point of the Echna Loch Bay event, will be at lay-by on the road next to the bay, down the hill from the fossil centre, and the meeting point for the Weyland Bay event will be at the lay-by opposite the sewage treatment works on Carness Road.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 4:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025.

This year, four of his colleagues will saddle up: partner John Smart and personal assistant Adele MacIver from the Inverness office, along with partner David Scott and senior associate Veli-Matti Raikkonen from Aberdeen.Mr Cormack said: \u0026ldquoEven in the midst of planning last year\u0026rsquos cycle, we knew we wanted to bring it back again.\u0026ldquoAnd while this is a social ride \u0026mdash starting and finishing in Avoch and looping round the Black Isle coast \u0026mdash it\u0026rsquos not necessarily an easy one. However, we can promise each rider some breathtaking sights, as well as the chance to catch up with like-minded people without the pro peleton pressures.\u0026ldquoThat said, the Scottish National Road Race Championship was recently held in the area, so those taking part have the kudos too of following in the footsteps \u0026ndash or tyre treads \u0026ndash of these impressive competitors.\u0026ldquoAnd for those less keen on the distance, or the traffic, there\u0026rsquos the shorter Poco Vuelta route that is a little less hilly, but the views are no less stunning.The event starts at the pavilion at Avoch at about 10.30am, and details of the routes can be found on Strava.For further information on the project, see www.justgiving/avochamenitiesassociationThursday 6 Sep 2018 4:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupThursday 6 Sep 2018 4:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

Mr Swinney said that while he did not personally sign off on the missive from Graeme Logan, a deputy director at the Scottish Government, he took full responsibility for it.            Mr Swinney told MSPs at Holyrood he remained committed to the Scottish national standardised assessments at all levels despite cross-party opposition and calls to “cut his losses” on the issue.            Ministers had been pressed to clarify whether parents had the right to pull their child out of the tests after concerns about the P1 assessments.READ MORE: Derek Mackay: Scotland will be ‘more prosperous’ after independenceThe letter from Mr Logan to councils last week said children could only be withdrawn in “exceptional circumstances” and stated that advice had been taken from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  - which was later disputed by the organisation.Conservative MSP Liz Smith asked whether Mr Swinney had personally signed off the letter, which she said had contained “misleading” information.He responded: “I did not sign off the letter that was issued by the deputy director to directors of education but I take full responsibility for it because I’m a minister in the Scottish Government and it’s right that I take full responsibility for it.            “We did not seek legal advice from Solar. We discussed the legal position that we hold to, which has been consistent throughout all of the government’s communication on this matter, we discussed that with representatives of the Solar organisation but ... an error was made in our handling of this in that we expressed a view which we believed to have been expressed by Solar, but which in fact Solar does not express such opinions.“I can only apologise to Parliament ... for the events that took place in that respect, but I take responsibility for it because I should take responsibility for it.”READ MORE: Primary 1 testing row explainedHe stressed that the substance of the letter was consistent with the Scottish Government’s position - that while there is no statutory right for parents to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling other than some parts of religious education, they could discuss the matter with the school.            Mr Swinney, who has already announced changes to the P1 tests in response to concerns, said he remained committed to them as they provided valuable information for teachers.“I want that information to be available so that at the earliest opportunity we can act to close the attainment gap,” he said.Green MSP Ross Greer urged Mr Swinney to “cut his losses”.“In the case of P1 tests it’s quite clear that a majority of this parliament want to see them go and sooner or later that is what we’re going to vote for,” he said.Labour’s Iain Gray said: “Faced with the evidence of stress on four and five-year-olds caused by these tests, testimony from teachers that they are time-consuming and of little educational worth, and a campaign by parents to boycott them, he is carrying on regardless.            “In P1, at least, they should be suspended. I believe that’s the view of this parliament and I hope we will have the chance to demonstrate that as soon as possible.”Lib Dem Tavish Scott urged Mr Swinney to “reflect on the fact that he hasn’t carried the case in terms of  four and five-year-old girls and boys”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794891.1536078053!/image/image.jpg","title":"oliver bullough how super rich used scotland to subvert democracy","story":"        The sinister tale of how a century-old law was abused to turn Scotland into a tax haven, writes Oliver Bullough.                Scotland became a tax haven thanks to 17 words, and one enterprising crook – perhaps in Eastern Europe? – who spotted them. The words were remarkably dull  but important. It was these words that attracted conmen and fraudsters from Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere and helped them hide their theft of billions of pounds.            The discovery of this Victorian law, which defines Scottish partnerships as different to those in the rest of the UK, illustrates the phenomenon that I call Moneyland. The s and servants of the super-rich are constantly scanning the world for legal loopholes like this one, and then exploiting them for the benefit of their clients’ money and the detriment of the rest of us.             If they can’t find a useful legal loophole, they find a friendly jurisdiction happy to create one for them. Places from Jersey to Lichtenstein to the Marshall Islands have long made a happy living by tailoring their laws to the needs of the wealthy. This has created a virtual country in which the planet’s richest residents can choose how they live in a way the rest of us cannot: Moneyland, a place where, whoever you are, wherever your money came from, the laws do not apply to you.The creation of Moneyland has helped the richest people monopolise an ever-greater share of the planet’s resources. According to Oxfam, the planet’s top 42 people own the same amount as the bottom half of the world’s population. Their ability to escape taxation and scrutiny means by next year, they’ll be richer still.Combatting their misuse of the world’s financial architecture is crucial to the defence of democracy. Perhaps 10 percent of all wealth is hidden behind the ramparts of the tax havens, and outside the reach of national exchequers. Its owners escape any form of democratic control as a result, yet can use their money to subvert our politics, just like they do in Russia. Unless we want Britain to become a plutocracy as well, we need to combat Moneyland before it’s too late.READ MORE: Scots firms ‘being used to launder dirty money from Russia’Scottish Limited Partnerships – Scotland’s own secrecy vehicle – appeared in 1907, in an updating of that 1890 law. They were used to secure agricultural tenancies, and remained distinctly unglamorous, until a century after their creation. That was when the enterprising crook spotted them. Within seven years, more SLPs were being created annually than had been created in the whole of their first 100 years, almost all of them linked to just 10 addresses.            Some of these SLPs were legitimate, and used by financiers to structure investment funds. But hundreds of them were dodgy, like the 119 SLPs abused in a scheme to secretly move 20 billion out of Russia in 2010-4. The SLPs were created by lawyers in the former Soviet Union, controlled from secrecy jurisdictions like Nevis or the Seychelles, so no one had any idea who owned them and therefore who was behind the crime that they were committing.Thanks to that wrinkle in the law – the 17 words – the SLPs could enter into contracts on their own account, but hide the identity of their owners as successfully as anything registered in the most notorious tax havens. It took the UK government  a decade to catch up with what the crooks are up to, and only now has Westminster decided to do something about them.READ MORE: ‘Kremlin trolls target Nicola Sturgeon’ after Russia criticismThis highlights the mismatch in resources between Moneylanders and the rest of us. Crooks and tax-dodgers are always keen to keep more of their money, so there is an army of lawyers and accountants perpetually looking for tricks they can use. Governments are far less nimble, and take years to discover what’s happening. By then, the crooks will have already identified new loopholes.            Those loopholes can be anywhere. Switzerland used to be the world’s primary location for stashing money, but the United States cracked open its defences after the financial crisis, and much of the cash fled for safer places. Ironically, the US states of Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming proved to be popular destinations for it, since they can protect secrets from the US Treasury in ways that foreign countries can’t.If Washington ever gets as strict with its own tax havens as it has been with foreigners, then the money will shift somewhere else: Hong Kong, Singapore, back to Switzerland. There will always be somewhere that has laxer regulations than its peers, and that is why Moneyland will always be with us unless the whole world acts to stop it. This is a result of the fact that money can move freely and seamlessly around the world, while laws stop at national frontiers. The rich live internationally, the rest of us have borders.This is the dark side of globalisation, and is a curiously recent phenomenon, a consequence of the invention of offshore finance in the City of London in the early 1960s. Before that, money was largely penned behind national boundaries, and rich people faced the kind of taxes their modern-day counterparts could never conceive of. There are no pop stars today singing – as The Beatles did – of the taxman taking 95 percent of their earnings. Taxes and regulations are for the little people, without access to Moneyland.So is Scotland still in the offshore game? The UK government has promised to crack down on Scottish Limited Partnerships, but they have already declined in popularity, thanks to being forced to declare their true owners: a step that made them less popular with the kind of crooks who seek anonymity.Curiously, however, Northern Irish Limited Partnerships are now surging in popularity. Just half a decade ago, the province was lucky if it registered five NILPs in a year, but now, there are almost 100 being registered annually. No one has any idea what lies behind this burst in activity or, at least, those that do know aren’t telling the rest of us.             If past experience is any guide, however, the Moneylanders will have made a few billion dollars out of the loophole before the rest of us figure out what it is.Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back by Oliver Bullough is published by Profile Books on 6 September at £20 hardback and ebook"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794964.1536137815!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll tories would lose scotland seat gains in snap brexit vote","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The United Nations is clear that legal provisions allowing any level of violent punishment of children are not compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u2028\u2028POLICE DOGSThe Programme for Government included a commitment to introduce a new criminal offence of harming or killing a service animal, including police dogs.The legislation – known as Finn’s Law – will be introduced by the end of this parliament.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"markets residents stress the need for social homes at gates of city hall","story":"\n\nRESIDENTS \nfrom the Markets took to the gates of City Hall last night to reiterate their call that land marked for social housing remains so.\nResidents and campaigners gathered on Monday night to mark the first anniversary of Belfast City Council’s vote to earmark land on the Gasworks site – previously zoned for social housing – available instead for a hotel extension and a multistorey carpark.\nMembers from the Homes Now campaign group handed in a petition to Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and Deputy Lord Mayor, Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid.

I’m going to the Euro qualifiers in October with the U-17s and won the Milk Cup with County Antrim last year.”\nBarry is usually found either in midfield or playing out on the wing and as a Liverpool fan growing up, looked up to players such as Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho as well as Barcelona legend, Lionel Messi.\nOf course, he has a long way to go to emulate his idols, but he has done everything right so far to have captured the interest of a professional club in England.\n“They saw me playing for Northern Ireland and asked me over for a trial,” explains the Turf Lodge lad.\n“I went over for two weeks and did well, so they brought me back for another two weeks and asked me to sign at the end of it.”\nBeing away from home is not a problem for the rising star as there are some familiar faces also signed to the Lancashire club.\n“There are two boys I would know from the Northern Ireland team living over there already,” he continued.\n“I already knew them before I went over. That makes it far easier for me to settle in.”\nBarry made the journey across to England at the weekend as he begins life at his new club and he is hoping to make his mark early.\nThe hope is to sufficiently impress in the next two years to earn himself another contract when he turns 18.\n “This is a completely new start with a new team and new players,” he acknowledged.\n“The aim is to get offered to stay for longer after these two years and for now I will be playing with the U-18s and hopefully start to climb the ladder.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alban maginness only aung san suu kyi has the moral authority to bring an end to genocide of the rohingya people","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The event did not draw much media attention, but symbolised the passionate commitment of local people in the search for justice for a helpless, persecuted Muslim minority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThis quiet, dignified event, organised by the Peace People, drew attention to the truly awful violence perpetrated by Myanmar government military forces against the civilian Muslim minority of Rohingyas, who live in the state of Rakhine in Myanmar.\n\nThe Rohingyas, who have lived in this area for many generations before and including the British colonisation of India and Burma, are not regarded as Myanmar citizens and have no legal right to citizenship.\n\nThe Myanmar military dictatorship passed laws in 1982, depriving Rohingyas of legal status within Myanmar, or Burma as it was then called.\n\nThis was done despite the fact that the Rohingyas had enjoyed citizenship from independence in 1948 right up until the military takeover in 1962. \n\nThe Myanmar authorities argue that the Rohingyas are merely illegal migrants from Bangladesh.\n\nDealing with the current situation in a detailed and forthright statement, Mairead Maguire said that she had visited Cox\u0027s Bazar, Chittagong, Bangladesh in February, where over a million Rohingya refugees were living in makeshift camps, having fled persecution by Myanmar\u0027s soldiers.\n\nListing in vivid detail many violations of human rights carried out by Myanmar troops, she said that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had labelled these atrocities as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\". \n\nSo bad was the situation that Ms Maguire called for those responsible to be made accountable before the International Criminal Court.\n\nShe declared that she was convinced that the attempted annihilation of the Rohingya should be officially declared as an act of genocide.\n\nShe went further and called upon the highly respected and acclaimed Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi - the de facto head of the Myanmar government - to acknowledge the genocide against the Rohingyas and to take action to stop such barbarity by the military.\n\nShortly after the Belfast event, the United Nations Fact Finding Mission Report was published in summary form. \n\nThe full report will be officially presented on September 18 by the UN.\n\nThe report accuses the Myanmar military and politicians of indiscriminate killings, large-scale gang rapes and the torching of over 400 villages in attacks described as widespread and systematic and which had \"genocidal intent\".\n\nSignificantly, it also calls for the Myanmar\u0027s military top brass, the Tatmadaw, to face the International Criminal Court for genocide, as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nThe report also singles out Aung San Suu Kyi for failure to use her position, or her moral authority, to prevent the developments in the Rakhine state. \n\nAs a result, her huge personal reputation hangs in the balance.\n\nWhile the report and its recommendations are clear and recognise that the 40-year-old campaign by the Myanmar armed forces is effectively genocide, it will take a lot of persuasion to make the UN Security Council take action against the Myanmar military, which controls the security policies of the government.\n\nThe military controls the ministries of defence and internal affairs and the vice-presidency. It also has a quarter of the seats in parliament.\n\nProbably more important in all of this is the attitude of the Chinese government, which has invested massive amounts of money in Myanmar and which is presently engaged in huge infrastructure works there.\n\nGiven their own gloomy record on human rights, it is hard to believe that they will do anything other than veto any sanctions, or other actions, by the UN against the Myanmar military establishment.\n\nThe position of Aung San Suu Kyi is pivotal, because she alone could turn the tide against the military by giving an alternative, politically moral position, upholding the inalienable human rights of the Rohingya people to basic citizenship and freedom.\n\nThe recognition of the Rohingya people as a discrete religious and ethnic minority in a country of other religious and ethnic minorities is essential for the future well-being of Myanmar.\n\nBut the reality is that the transition in 2015 from a enclosed military dictatorship to real democracy and freedom has only been partially achieved.\n\nAnd great though that peaceful achievement was by Aung San Suu Kyi, there comes a time to conclude that realpolitik with the Myanmar military can go only so far and that a bold and characteristically courageous stand needs to be taken by the formidable political figure of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nNor should we forget the persistent work by our own, courageous Mairead Maguire in bringing such international human rights issues to our attention over many years.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"boundary commission submits final proposals for northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I\u0027ve restored a property myself.. but this can\u0027t be allowed. They need to tear it down and tell Primark it should be rebuild to look exactly the same.\"\n\nFire broke out on the roof of the five-storey city centre store last Tuesday . It took three days to extinguish and work is ongoing to assess the structural integrity of what remains. Work was ongoing on a £30m extension to the store and it is thought to be largely untouched.\n\n\n\nBelfast city centre Primark fire cordon to remain for four months\n \n\n\n\"There\u0027s the stink that is driving people away from the city and if you close that area of the city down for four months there is a real fear people won\u0027t come back.\n\n\"It\u0027s called established business because we have worked to build a customer base - shopping is a habit. You can\u0027t close down for at least four months and expect those people to turn up again on the Monday morning.\n\n\"Zara, McDonald\u0027s and Tesco drive big amounts of people into the city as did Primark - and they are all closed.\n\n\"We may be ok, we will look after our staff and as we are in the cordon and our insurance may cover us. But those just outside - some who had seen trade drop 90% - will not get a cent.\n\n\"There is a feeling the preservation of the building is the main priority but at what cost?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Boyle pointed to a similar incident in Derry when the historic Tillie \u0026 Henderson clothing factory was demolished within days after a series of arson attacks at the beginning of the century.\n\nHe added: \"We are nine days after the fire here in Belfast and nothing has been done. They say it is four months for the exclusion zone. You are talking £130,000 for a new shop, I could sign a lease for four months in another part of the city and then they shorten the cordon in November, allow us to open and leave me with two shops?\n\n\"Take my business out of it. Belfast trade is struggling and to close this part of the city down in the run up to Christmas - when 40% of annual trade is done - will put people out of business.\n\n\"We were told as a matter of fact the zone would remain in place for four months - but no one seems to have thought \u0027no that can\u0027t happen\u0027.\n\n\"It is unaccepatable. They need to find another solution.\"\n\nAndrew Webb, chair of Belfast City Centre Management also attended the meeting. He said there was a lot of frustration but did not get the impression the priority was for the preservation of the building and it was more a case no one was in a position to access the building and therefore determine what should or could be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimark following last week’s blaze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no heritage input at this stage. It is a dangerous building that is why there is a need for the cordon.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"nigel dodds airs frustration over postbrexit ni security

They revealed a Stormont soap opera beyond what even the most cynical satirist would have come up with.\n\nRampant jealousies and jockeying for position, and a leading DUP figure taping others.\n\nThen there\u0027s the extraordinary allegation that former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  Minister Jonathan Bell tried to punch his special adviser Timothy Cairns and break his finger.\n\nThis is material you would expect on the Jeremy Kyle Show.\n\nBut it\u0027s actually a glimpse into what was going on behind-the-scenes in the DUP, which we have always been told is one big  happy family.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party did tear itself apart during David Trimble\u0027s leadership, but at least no accusations of physical violence were ever made.\n\nIn his written witness statement, Dr McCormick referred to the poor relationship between Mr Bell and Mr Cairns. The special adviser made allegations that the minister \"tried to break his finger and swung a punch at him\".\n\nIt is, of course, important to point out that Dr McCormick was not in any shape or form validating the claims made against the minister.\n\nIndeed, he said: \"I think I should emphasise that, for most of the time when Jonathan Bell was Deti Minister, I got on very well with him: both as minister, and at a human level in all the ordinary day to day interactions that are inherent to the job.\n\n\"Jonathan Bell actively sought my advice and involvement... always appeared to respect my role and position, often with relaxed good humour, and I had absolutely no personal experience of his exerting  untoward pressure or bullying, as others have alleged.\"\n\nMr Bell, who is due to appear before the RHI Inquiry tomorrow, will surely address the allegations, and Mr Cairns will have his say when he gives evidence next Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nDr McCormick said Mr Bell had recorded conversations with himself and with DUP Upper Bann MLA Carla Lockhart.\n\nThere were claims that a trip by the former DUP minister to the US in 2016 to lead an Invest NI Trade Mission \"had not gone well\".\n\nMr Bell was \"visibly tired at a key meeting on Friday, January 28, 2016\" and Mr McCormick said it was his \"impression\" that he had been \"unable to participate fully in the meeting in a constructive way\" as he had \"quite a late night\" the previous evening.\n\nThere was friction over Mr Bell\u0027s lack of invitation to a Wrightbus event in Ballymena involving London Mayor Boris Johnson which Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness attended in February 2016.\n\nMr Bell was clearly very keen to increase his profile and assert his independence as minister. This brought him into direct conflict with the party\u0027s top brass.\n\nThe outcome of that long-running battle will be decided at the RHI Inquiry.\n\nThe former DETI minister\u0027s claims and those of his opponents will be examined in painstaking detail over coming days and weeks.\n\nBoth sides know the stakes couldn\u0027t be any higher.\n\nSome of key figures with links to botched green energy scheme\n\nANDREW McCORMICK\n\nFormer permanent secretary at Deti. In February he moved from leading the Department for the Economy to become director general of International Relations, heading up NI’s preparations for Brexit.\n\nANDREW CRAWFORD\n\nWas special adviser to then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster when the RHI scheme was developed and launched in autumn 2012. He has appeared a number of times in front of the RHI Inquiry.\n\nTIMOTHY JOHNSTON\n\nFormer special adviser to three First Ministers: Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster. Last year the DUP appointed him to the newly-created senior post of chief executive officer.\n\nTIMOTHY CAIRNS\n\nFormer special adviser to Jonathan Bell when he was Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. He is now a member of the board of cross-border business body InterTradeIreland.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We would encourage the people of Northern Ireland to get behind Liam and cast their vote for this young creative between 27th August and 9th September.”\n\nThe BIC® KIDS Young Artist Award rewards creativity by taking children’s drawings from the fridge door on to massive public billboards returned in July this year. \n\nRegional finalists were chosen via an expert judging panel made up of creatives from the marketing, publishing and illustration industries and they will have their artworks used on 71 billboards across the UK and Republic of Ireland between August 27 and September 9. \n\nLiam’s artwork is up against 13 others in the public vote. The public vote is now open at \nBICKIDS/uk/youngartist\n to decide the overall champion.\n\nIf the young Derry lad wins, his masterpiece will be used on a further 26 billboards from late September.\n\nBe sure to support local lad, Liam, and get voting for him down to a fine art!\n\n\nPictured above: The impressive young Derry artist, Liam, aged 8, with his proud mum, Senga.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new radnor pictures knockout fun at new radnor carnival","story":"\nNew Radnor Carnival Queen, Bethan Evans with Princess, Ella Davies, and King, Jo\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsh Probert, and atte\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtndant Jack Hughes.

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8481628.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
