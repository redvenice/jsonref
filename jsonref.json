These would be among the first contracts awarded for NEOM.

Her family descended from the Royal House of Scotland and their family seat and home was Glamis Castle.When the First World War began, also on The Queen Mother’s birthday in 1914, Glamis Castle became a hospital and she assisted with welfare work with the patients. From a young age, she had been friends with King George V’s children, even acting as a bridesmaid at the wedding of their daughter, Princess Mary.In 1923, her engagement to HRH The Duke of York, the King and Queen’s second son was announced and they were married on April 26 in Westminster Abbey. They had two children, Princess Elizabeth on April 21, 1926 and Princess Margaret, on August 21, 1930.          The Queen Mother with her daughter Princess Elizabeth after the coronation of King George VIAfter King George V died and King Edward VIII abdicated, the Duke of York was proclaimed King George VI and the Duchess became Queen Elizabeth, the first British-born Queen consort since the Tudor age. During the Second World War, many suggested that the Queen should evacuate to North America or Canada with her daughters.Her response: ‘The children won\u0027t go without me. I won\u0027t leave the King. And the King will never leave.\u0027 However, the Queen Mother struggled through the dangers of the war and was in Buckingham Palace when it was bombed in September 1940.Due to the King’s ill health, Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh took their places on a tour of Canada and then to Australia and New Zealand, during which the King died on February 6, 1952. After his death, the Queen Mother continued her public duties all over the world, including 40 official visits abroad.When is Meghan Markle’s birthday?Meghan Markle shares her birthday with the late Queen Mother on Sunday, August 4 and this year, would have marked her 118th birthday, if she had still been alive. The Queen Mother passed away in March 2002.How will Meghan Markle celebrate her birthday?There will be no African safari this year for Meghan Markle and instead, she will spend her 37th birthday, her first as the wife of Prince Harry, at the wedding of his childhood pal Charlie van Straubenzee, who was previously rumoured to be lined up to act as his best man.

Six hundred users had said they would attend  Eye of the storm: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s social network said it had found a new attempt to meddle in the U.S. elections - this time the mid-terms which will be seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump          Anti-Trump event: This was one of the around 30 fake events created by the fake accounts exposed by Facebook Tuesday          Actual protest: This was the anti-Trump and \u0027anti-fascist\u0027 event in Times Square which the fake account promoted. Facebook did not provide the date of the fake account\u0027s post, meaning it is impossible to know if it was the first to suggest it or was repeating calls made elsewhere          Memes: The fake accounts created pages which were clearly designed to be shareable. By reacting to them, genuine users prompted the pages to show up in their own timelines, meaning that their friends would then also see them          Protest: The \u0027reSisters\u0027 page said \u0027The Trump regime is illegitimate\u0027 and was one of a series of profiles revealed by Facebook on TuesdayAmong the new accounts were one called \u0027Resisters\u0027 which promoted a fake anti-right wing protest in August in Washington D.C. It said 2,600 people had expressed interest in the event, with 600 planning to attend the protest at a park close to the White House. Other promoted anti-Trump memes, including one calling for him to resign, while others were related to African-American and Native American movements.One encouraged participation in a demonstration against fascism in Times Square last November.Hundreds of people turned up for the event, but it was widely advertised on other profiles, and it is unclear if the fake account was the one which started the event. \u0027This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don\u0027t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they\u0027re doing,\u0027 Facebook said in a posting.During a conference call Tuesday, Facebook executives declined to paint a broader nature of the pages, including whether they included a range of political positions. Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said that the attempts to manipulate public opinion would likely become more sophisticated to evade Facebook´s scrutiny, calling it an \u0027arms race.\u0027\u0027This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don\u0027t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they´re doing,\u0027 the company said in a blogpost. The Facebook exectives also did not say whether any of the activity mentioned specific candidates or politicians, and were careful to say that Facebook is not \u0027publicly\u0027 linking the activity to any group or government. But it added that it still does not know who was behind the coordinated campaign saying they had gone to great lengths to keep their true identities secret. \u0027It\u0027s clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) has in the past,\u0027 it said.\u0027We believe this could be partly due to changes we\u0027ve made over the last year to make this kind of abuse much harder.\u0027Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, called the disclosure \u0027further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow ision and spread disinformation.\u0027 Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, in a statement urged Facebook to move against foreign groups trying to sway American voters and to warn legitimate users that such activity, as seen in 2016, is recurring this year.\u0027Today\u0027s announcement from Facebook demonstrates what we\u0027ve long feared: that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously-identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponize social media platforms to influence the U.S. electorate,\u0027 Schiff said.  The earliest page was created in March 2017. Facebook says more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages. The most followed Facebook pages had names such as \u0027Aztlan Warriors,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Black Elevation,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Mindful Being,\u0027 and \u0027Resisters.\u0027Facebook didn\u0027t provide detailed descriptions of those pages. But the names it released are reminiscent of groups set up by Russian agents to draw in and manipulate Americans with particular ethnic, cultural or political identities ahead of the 2016 election. That effort targeted people with both liberal and conservative leanings.           Racial charge: Some of the material appeared to be an attempt to piggyback on tensions over race, highlighting a news story which told how Colombus Day had been canceled in Los Angeles          Created community: One fake account produced a vast number of people interested in it. It appeared to be part of an overall intention to create more racial tension  Anti-white rhetoric: Many of the examples published by Facebook were not explicitly about party politics but referenced Aztlan, the historical - or possibly mythical - home of the Aztec people. Its location is unclear but some people have placed it in the modern-day southwest United States and linked the Indian Wars to it          Also in the cache: This was one of the messages which Facebook released. It has not disclosed the entire output of the fake accounts  Also in the cache: One account was called \u0027mindful being\u0027 and the examples of its posting published by Facebook had no clear intentAmong the techniques used to cover their trails were virtual private networks, and internet phone services. None had Russian IP addresses, the unique number ever computer or server has which allows its location to be discovered.However Facebook said that it had found links to some of the Facebook pages set up by the IRA in 2016. One page, the Resisters account which was trying to organize a fake rally, had an IRA account as an administrator for eight minutes. Facebook briefed lawmakers earlier this week on the discovery the New York Times reported. The company will hold a conference call later on Tuesday.It said that 290,000 users followed at least one of the accounts.The most followed Facebook pages were \u0027Aztlan Warriors,\u0027 \u0027Black Elevation,\u0027 \u0027Mindful Being,\u0027 and \u0027Resisters\u0027, the network said. In total the accounts had 9,500 posts, all but one of them on Facebook, the other on Instagram.They paid for around 150 advertisements, at a total cost of $11,000, some of which also ran on Instagram.The ads were paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars, starting in April 2017 and ending in June 2018.They also created 30 fake \u0027events\u0027, with one event - which Facebook did not name - having 4,700 people saying they were interested in going, and 1,400 users saying they would attend.Because Facebook did not name the event, it is unclear if it happened or not. Washington imposed punitive sanctions on Russia following U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow interfered to undermine the 2016 U.S. elections, one of the reasons U.S.-Russian relations are at a post-Cold War low. Both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have said, however, that they want to improve ties between the two nuclear powers.Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names had used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about isive issues, setting up events and buying ads.U.S. intelligence agencies said Russian state operators ran the campaign combining fake social media posts and hacking into Democratic Party networks, eventually becoming an effort to help Republican candidate Trump, who scored a surprise victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Over the past several months, the company has taken steps meant to reassure U.S. and European lawmakers that further regulation is unnecessary. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says the company has 20,000 people working to police and protect the site.Costs associated with that effort are part of the reason Facebook said last week that it expects its profit margins to decline. The revelation caps a disastrous week for Facebook, which has seen its share price plunge and billions of dollars being wiped off its total market value and the personal wealth of Mark Zuckerberg, its founder. But Facebook\u0027s share price was not affected by the announcement, going up slightly in the course of the day from its $170.67 opening.However it remains far from its peak price of $217.50 last week, which was followed by the plunge in value as it unveiled lower than expected user growth and lost $120 billion of value in just one day. Stuck in Hell until 2020: Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly...\u0027The hell with Mueller!\u0027 Fox Business host Lou Dobbs says...It IS getting harder for immigrants to gain asylum in the...Trump tweets about Mexico\u0027s record murder rate after last...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/17/4EB7E9E500000578-0-image-a-5_1533055144051.jpg","title":"New pictures reveal dolphin survived extreme sunburn stranded ashore","story":"    Spirtle the bottlenose dolphin managed to survive this extreme bout of sunburn          She was stranded on shore for more than 24 hours when she suffered the sunburn          Over the past two years, Spritle\u0027s skin has managed to recover and she is behaving normallyBut new images have revealed how the six-year-old dolphin\u0027s injuries have continued to heal - more than two years later.University of Aberdeen scientists and Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer Charlie Phillips have been monitoring her ongoing recovery.Mr Phillips took the latest image of Spirtle close to Fort George, near Ardersier, on the Moray Firth. University Challenge trends on Twitter as viewers struggle...Father-of-two, 37, dies in his sleep after being punched on...Share this articleDr Barbara Cheney, a research Fellow at the Lighthouse Field Station, University of Aberdeen, said: \u0027Spirtle was in a group with four other dolphins near the Sutors of Cromarty last Friday.\u0027It is difficult to know exactly how her recovery is going as we are of course judging only on photographs and her behaviour.\u0027But we weren\u0027t optimistic when we first saw her two months after the stranding in July 2016 when we saw the extent of her wound and the damage to her skin.\u0027However, since then we have been happily surprised by the progress of her healing, and when we spotted her last Friday the wound was completely healed over.\u0027Also when we saw her initially after the stranding she was often on her own, but now she is interacting more with other dolphins and her behaviour is what we would expect to see from any other six-year-old dolphin.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/18/4EB5938200000578-6012143-image-a-8_1533059830927.jpg","title":"The elephant thinks giraffe Animal stands hind legs reach high leaves","story":"In the delightful snaps, the big male can be seen stretching up on his back legs while reaching out for leaves with his trunk          Taken by Duncan Taylor while he was on a family holiday in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, the photos reflect the agility of the enormous mammalsThe behaviour is usually only seen by circus elephants and is rarely spotted in the wild.Duncan, 48, said: \u0027We were standing in the camp site and a bull elephant walked up the waterhole to get a drink of water.Stunning photos of animals in their natural settings are not...Threats to lift ban on trophy-hunting in Botswana - dubbed...Share this article\u0027It first walked to the tree, lifted its trunk to smell and then positioned itself under the branches.\u0027It then raised itself up until it was standing on its hind legs and stretched as far as it could reach with its trunk and pulled down some food to eat and then gently lowered itself to the ground.

directing bright pupils towards general degrees at good universities in the belief that this is the best route to a professional job – even if the skills learned have only limited use in the workplace.           Mr Hinds said the Government\u0027s new T-levels and degree apprenticeships in jobs such as engineering and accounting will provide fast-track routes to \u0027highly-skilled work\u0027In his first major speech on social mobility, Mr Hinds outlined his vision for ersifying the routes to good careers.You MUST teach your children basic speech at home, minister...France bans

from To Kill a Mockingbird.Speaking at the Resolution Foundation, the Education Secretary, 48, said he would recommend Harper Lee\u0027s classic novel to pupils because of its messages on overcoming difficult circumstances. \u0027Character, resilience, virtue, upstandingness – there\u0027s a lot of education in that book and a lot to be learned from that character,\u0027 he said.Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his portrayal of Finch, who defends a black man wrongly accused of rape in Alabama, in the 1962 film.                                                    \u0027For a long time, one of the reasons university was such a key determinant of future success was that many of the alternative options towards highly-skilled work were frankly not up to scratch.\u0027Technical education in this country has long been seen by many as the second-best option to academic study and university.\u0027New technical qualifications, T-levels, are being introduced as an alternative to A-levels, and businesses are being encouraged to create \u0027degree apprenticeships\u0027, which combine instruction with work experience.The qualifications have been created in partnership with employers, and have \u0027real currency\u0027 in industry, said Mr Hinds. \u0027Our goal is that all young people, whatever their background, will have much better choices when they start thinking about their post-16 and post-18 destinations,\u0027 he added.Asked later if he thought it would give these routes more credence if middle-class children took them, he replied: \u0027Yes, I do.\u0027University participation has expanded over the past few decades, but because the job market is now over-supplied with graduates, a good university degree is no longer a guaranteed passport to a skilled job.Mr Hinds also used his speech to dismiss claims that elite universities are institutionally biased against disadvantaged students. However, he acknowledged that more must be done to encourage such students to apply.He urged the elite universities of the Russell Group to \u0027reach out\u0027 to poorer pupils and do more to make sure they are admitted – for example, by making socio-economic background an admissions consideration.Mr Hinds also said disadvantaged parents should encourage their children to tackle tougher subjects because they can be a \u0027signalling device\u0027 to universities and employers that a pupil is clever."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/21/4EB992C100000578-0-image-m-7_1533070607126.jpg","title":"The modern family businesses run children","story":"    Family affair: Jordan Weller and his mother Julie prepare clothes for his online businesses which rakes in some £500-a-dayJordan, who lives at home with his parents in Essex, pays his mum a weekly wage of £80 to collect up to 50 items of vintage sportswear once or twice a week, which she\u0027ll wash and iron. She also prepares the quarterly report for the accountant.\u0027She takes the lead on all the things I don\u0027t have time to do\u0027, Jordan says. \u0027I could give her more work but it\u0027s difficult as the business is online and she\u0027s not very good on the computer.\u0027How to stay safe when banking and shopping online - and...Backlash! Customers furious as Nationwide axes vital phone...ASK TONY: Is TUI allowed to bill me £85 to sit with my five...Shoppers will need a special code when they pay with a card...Share this articleWhile his mum is busy preparing the stock, Jordan has more time to list the Eighties and Nineties sports gear, made by popular brands such as Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, on three websites: ASOS Marketplace, Depop and his own site.Having Julie on board also means he can put more energy into negotiating with suppliers across the world.These are iniduals based in Canada, Ukraine, Indonesia and Thailand, who source vintage garments and send Jordan pictures of what they pick up each day.Jordan began selling vintage clothes five years ago, when he left school aged 16. He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SISTER MODELS CLOTHES While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.GRANDAD WHO\u0027S A TRAINER WHIZZDaniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.\u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027MUM\u0027S A VINTAGE BARGAIN HUNTER  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesNatacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.\u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart.

Salman Abedi, who attacked the Manchester arena was rescued from Libya onboard HMS Enterprise, pictured arriving in Valetta, Malta on August 4, 2014. Abedi was among 110 Britons - including his brother Hashem - rescued from the war zone by the Royal NavyThey also demanded to know why the Abedis – British-born sons of Libyan migrants – had been allowed to visit the Middle Eastern state without apparent scrutiny and subsequently fell off the security services\u0027 radar.Robby Potter, 48, who almost died in the attack after shrapnel from the bomb punctured his heart, told the Mail: \u0027The authorities have definitely hidden this information from us. They haven\u0027t been honest. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this article\u0027The Government should have told us straight away or it should have been in the reports. We have been left to find out through the Press.\u0027John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, said: \u0027It is deeply concerning that the Royal Navy\u0027s role in extracting Salman Abedi has had to be uncovered by a media investigation rather than being volunteered by the British Government.          Robby Potter, pictured with his wife Leonora Ogerio. They were both wounded in the attack\u0027In particular, David Anderson QC needs to explain why he did not include this in his report into the Manchester bombing – was he kept in the dark or did he choose to hide it from the public?\u0027Either way, this undermines the important role he had as Britain\u0027s independent reviewer of terror legislation.\u0027I believe the Navy acted perfectly properly in rescuing these British citizens but unnecessary secrecy leaves the unfortunate impression that the Government has something it wants to hide.\u0027 It is understood that the Ministry of Defence was the first Whitehall department to discover that Abedi had been rescued by the Royal Navy.          Abedi was already being monitored by the security services seven months before his rescueHis name emerged on passenger lists handed to the sailors on HMS Enterprise. The information was subsequently passed on to Number Ten, the Foreign Office and the Home Office.Whitehall sources said that Abedi\u0027s rescue did not come to light in the Anderson report because it had no relevance to potential security failings.But Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the bombing for the forthcoming inquests, said: \u0027The trouble with the Anderson report is that we are not allowed to see the primary sources – that is, the MI5 or other security service documents.\u0027I am sure that the security services have not told us the full story. We may need an inquiry to get at the truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Both Abedi and his brother ought to have been tracked better, there are certainly concerns around that.\u0027           The Daily Mail yesterday uncovered how Abedi was rescued by the Royal Navy from LibyaThe Anderson report revealed that Abedi was already being monitored by the security services a full seven months before the rescue and that MI5 closed his file as a result of mistaken identify a month prior to his evacuation from Libya in 2014.Senior security sources insist Abedi had not been radicalised at the time of the rescue and instead was brainwashed after watching bomb-making videos on the internet.However, other sources have claimed that Abedi was seen on the front line, fighting alongside jihadis in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya. Survivors of the atrocity said it was difficult to understand why the Abedis were not detained or monitored following the rescue on their return to the UK.Mr Potter, who was blown up while waiting for his daughter after the concert, said: \u0027The security services must have known the Abedis had gone to Libya to fight. They\u0027ve got questions to answer about why they let them back in the UK as free men.\u0027The security services should have questioned the Abedis about what they were doing in Libya, at the very least. They should have been taken back to Libya and not allowed into Britain.\u0027             Hashem Abedi, 21, brother of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi has claimed he is afraid to be extradited to the UK to face terrorism charges The UK government requested his extradition last October from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. But the high-level negotiations appear to have stalled.And in May Libyan judicial sources told the Mail that Hashem could escape justice by refusing to face trial in the UK. His opposition to being extradited might hold weight because he has joint Libyan citizenship, a source said.Mr Salem suggested however that Hashem, who was born in Manchester to Libyan migrants, might not be able to veto any attempt to bring him to Britain. \u0027He was afraid and he didn\u0027t want the Libyan Government to hand him over to Britain,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was very scared and the matter was still very hot but the decision is not in his hands. To me it\u0027s obvious he has committed a crime in Britain – of course he wouldn\u0027t want to be handed to them.\u0027Hashem is believed to have played a key role in the attack in May last year, including helping to buy materials for the homemade bomb set off by his brother Salman.He has also been linked to a plot to kill Peter Millett, the UK\u0027s former envoy to Libya. It is alleged he was in a four-man cell planning to carry out the attack using a suicide bomb. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this articleIt was claimed they also plotted to kill former UN envoy Martin Kobler and Libya\u0027s prime minister Fayez Al-Sarraj. Mr Salem said: \u0027This case is quite difficult, it is not going to be that easy for Hashem to be handed over. He is a Libyan citizen and yes although he is a British national as well, it is considered that he has also committed a crime here in Libya.\u0027Mr Salem said the decision over Hashem\u0027s future was for the Libyan government to decide and not his militia: \u0027The decision to hand him over is not in our hands.\u0027But he said his Special Deterrence Force unit would willingly release Hashem from its jail, which is holding around 250 Islamic State suspects, should they be asked to do so. He said: \u0027We cannot say no. What concerns us is that we want to reassure the British people.\u0027I understand so many innocent lives were lost, and the British people feel they we are not giving them the justice they are seeking because they presume that because he is a Libyan citizen and currently in Libya that we are providing him a safe haven.            Salman Abedi, pictured, murdered 22 people during a terrorism attack on the Manchester Arena \u0027On the contrary. We do want him to face justice.\u0027Our main concern is that he does face justice no matter if it is in Libya or Britain.\u0027Of Hashem\u0027s brother, he added: \u0027It is unfortunate that they had accommodated Salman for several years in their country and he has the British passport and he committed such a thing to a country that sheltered him and served him and that he would blow himself up and that he would kill innocent children.\u0027Even his own family were shocked. We met with them and have spoken to them.\u0027Mr Salem said there was enough evidence to convict Hashem, and he had \u0027confessed to everything\u0027.He added: \u0027He is facing two things. Either he is going to be tried in Libya or he is going to be tried in Britain. If the British government and the Libyan government reach an agreement for handing him over he will be then tried in Britain.\u0027He denied any suggestion that Hashem could have been tortured into confessing his role in the Manchester attack. And he said the suspect did not get his warped ideology from Libya: \u0027He was watching a lot of the videos on YouTube, watching videos of children in Iraq and Syria.\u0027The SDF has been tasked by the Tripoli government with hunting down Islamic State fighters."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/01/4EBAE7B500000578-6013245-image-a-2_1533083301414.jpg","title":"Alaska Airlines apologizes gay couple kicked seats DENY homophobia cause","story":"    David Cooley said he and his partner were flying from New York JFK to LAX when a flight attendant asked his companion to move seats          Cooley said in a tweet on Tuesday that he accepted their apology and he is \u0027discussing making things right\u0027 The company added: \u0027It’s our policy to keep all families seated together whenever possible that didn’t happen here and we are deeply sorry for the situation.

Salman Abedi, who attacked the Manchester arena was rescued from Libya onboard HMS Enterprise, pictured arriving in Valetta, Malta on August 4, 2014. Abedi was among 110 Britons - including his brother Hashem - rescued from the war zone by the Royal NavyThey also demanded to know why the Abedis – British-born sons of Libyan migrants – had been allowed to visit the Middle Eastern state without apparent scrutiny and subsequently fell off the security services\u0027 radar.Robby Potter, 48, who almost died in the attack after shrapnel from the bomb punctured his heart, told the Mail: \u0027The authorities have definitely hidden this information from us. They haven\u0027t been honest. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this article\u0027The Government should have told us straight away or it should have been in the reports. We have been left to find out through the Press.\u0027John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, said: \u0027It is deeply concerning that the Royal Navy\u0027s role in extracting Salman Abedi has had to be uncovered by a media investigation rather than being volunteered by the British Government.          Robby Potter, pictured with his wife Leonora Ogerio. They were both wounded in the attack\u0027In particular, David Anderson QC needs to explain why he did not include this in his report into the Manchester bombing – was he kept in the dark or did he choose to hide it from the public?\u0027Either way, this undermines the important role he had as Britain\u0027s independent reviewer of terror legislation.\u0027I believe the Navy acted perfectly properly in rescuing these British citizens but unnecessary secrecy leaves the unfortunate impression that the Government has something it wants to hide.\u0027 It is understood that the Ministry of Defence was the first Whitehall department to discover that Abedi had been rescued by the Royal Navy.          Abedi was already being monitored by the security services seven months before his rescueHis name emerged on passenger lists handed to the sailors on HMS Enterprise. The information was subsequently passed on to Number Ten, the Foreign Office and the Home Office.Whitehall sources said that Abedi\u0027s rescue did not come to light in the Anderson report because it had no relevance to potential security failings.But Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the bombing for the forthcoming inquests, said: \u0027The trouble with the Anderson report is that we are not allowed to see the primary sources – that is, the MI5 or other security service documents.\u0027I am sure that the security services have not told us the full story. We may need an inquiry to get at the truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Both Abedi and his brother ought to have been tracked better, there are certainly concerns around that.\u0027           The Daily Mail yesterday uncovered how Abedi was rescued by the Royal Navy from LibyaThe Anderson report revealed that Abedi was already being monitored by the security services a full seven months before the rescue and that MI5 closed his file as a result of mistaken identify a month prior to his evacuation from Libya in 2014.Senior security sources insist Abedi had not been radicalised at the time of the rescue and instead was brainwashed after watching bomb-making videos on the internet.However, other sources have claimed that Abedi was seen on the front line, fighting alongside jihadis in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya. Survivors of the atrocity said it was difficult to understand why the Abedis were not detained or monitored following the rescue on their return to the UK.Mr Potter, who was blown up while waiting for his daughter after the concert, said: \u0027The security services must have known the Abedis had gone to Libya to fight. They\u0027ve got questions to answer about why they let them back in the UK as free men.\u0027The security services should have questioned the Abedis about what they were doing in Libya, at the very least. They should have been taken back to Libya and not allowed into Britain.\u0027             Hashem Abedi, 21, brother of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi has claimed he is afraid to be extradited to the UK to face terrorism charges The UK government requested his extradition last October from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. But the high-level negotiations appear to have stalled.And in May Libyan judicial sources told the Mail that Hashem could escape justice by refusing to face trial in the UK. His opposition to being extradited might hold weight because he has joint Libyan citizenship, a source said.Mr Salem suggested however that Hashem, who was born in Manchester to Libyan migrants, might not be able to veto any attempt to bring him to Britain. \u0027He was afraid and he didn\u0027t want the Libyan Government to hand him over to Britain,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was very scared and the matter was still very hot but the decision is not in his hands. To me it\u0027s obvious he has committed a crime in Britain – of course he wouldn\u0027t want to be handed to them.\u0027Hashem is believed to have played a key role in the attack in May last year, including helping to buy materials for the homemade bomb set off by his brother Salman.He has also been linked to a plot to kill Peter Millett, the UK\u0027s former envoy to Libya. It is alleged he was in a four-man cell planning to carry out the attack using a suicide bomb. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this articleIt was claimed they also plotted to kill former UN envoy Martin Kobler and Libya\u0027s prime minister Fayez Al-Sarraj. Mr Salem said: \u0027This case is quite difficult, it is not going to be that easy for Hashem to be handed over. He is a Libyan citizen and yes although he is a British national as well, it is considered that he has also committed a crime here in Libya.\u0027Mr Salem said the decision over Hashem\u0027s future was for the Libyan government to decide and not his militia: \u0027The decision to hand him over is not in our hands.\u0027But he said his Special Deterrence Force unit would willingly release Hashem from its jail, which is holding around 250 Islamic State suspects, should they be asked to do so. He said: \u0027We cannot say no. What concerns us is that we want to reassure the British people.\u0027I understand so many innocent lives were lost, and the British people feel they we are not giving them the justice they are seeking because they presume that because he is a Libyan citizen and currently in Libya that we are providing him a safe haven.            Salman Abedi, pictured, murdered 22 people during a terrorism attack on the Manchester Arena \u0027On the contrary. We do want him to face justice.\u0027Our main concern is that he does face justice no matter if it is in Libya or Britain.\u0027Of Hashem\u0027s brother, he added: \u0027It is unfortunate that they had accommodated Salman for several years in their country and he has the British passport and he committed such a thing to a country that sheltered him and served him and that he would blow himself up and that he would kill innocent children.\u0027Even his own family were shocked. We met with them and have spoken to them.\u0027Mr Salem said there was enough evidence to convict Hashem, and he had \u0027confessed to everything\u0027.He added: \u0027He is facing two things. Either he is going to be tried in Libya or he is going to be tried in Britain. If the British government and the Libyan government reach an agreement for handing him over he will be then tried in Britain.\u0027He denied any suggestion that Hashem could have been tortured into confessing his role in the Manchester attack. And he said the suspect did not get his warped ideology from Libya: \u0027He was watching a lot of the videos on YouTube, watching videos of children in Iraq and Syria.\u0027The SDF has been tasked by the Tripoli government with hunting down Islamic State fighters."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/01/4EB5404E00000578-6013259-image-a-51_1533083644666.jpg","title":"Jacket worn Han Solo Empire Strikes set set 1m goes hammer","story":"    The jacket worn by Harrison Ford in his role as Han Solo in the Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back is expected to fetch up to £1 million          Also among the lots to be auctioned will be a Stormtrooper helmet from the first Star Wars film, A New Hope, which is expected to fetch up to £60,000, as well as as similar helmet from the most recent film The Last Jedi, which could raise up to £50,000          The Fedora (estimate £200-300,000) and Bullwhip (estimate £50-70,000) as used by Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Joes and the Temple of Doom          Harrison Ford wearing the Han Solo jacket.

But in its latest quarterly health check on the economy, the NIESR said May’s version of a soft Brexit was still not soft enough. The government was aiming for market access similar to that enjoyed by Switzerland but with a much tougher migration system. “In our view, the government will have to make significant concessions to the EU,” it said.It added, however, that even these modest growth rates relied on the UK continuing to have close to full access to the EU market for its goods and services.The more limited proposals for market access in the recently published white paper would lead to a loss of output amounting to £500 per person over time, compared to a soft Brexit.“The loss would be around £800 under a ‘no deal’ Brexit. These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses,” said the thinktank. Jagjit Chadha, director of the NIESR, said: “In the UK, uncertainty about exit from the EU seems to be limiting the development of policies to promote more inclusive growth.” Brexit, he added, was a demanding agenda that was causing political stasis. “Things are not happening that should be happening.”Chadha said pre-Brexit Britain was “gripped by an unusual amount of uncertainty, you might call it an epidemic of uncertainty – we haven’t worked out how to do it”.The NIESR said the Bank of England would need to take account of the uncertainty when setting interest rates. While supporting a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs this week, the Bank should make it clear that it was prepared to reverse the decision, the institute added. “The UK is just eight months away from the March 2019 EU exit date and the range of outcomes remains as wide as ever. We are by no means sure that there will be a deal by then, and even if there is a deal it is not clear how policymakers, businesses and households will respond to the new arrangement. And, all along, the chance of a second referendum is rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d7f7c1d6755a0985834843a4fbee65b9aa18a56/0_242_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4c3e8c9ed60134ed58efceb1c3c5d3","title":"fca proves to be a paper tiger in case of rbs mistreatment","story":"Lack of power to act will feed belief that those who caused crash have escaped punishmentThe Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger.Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago.Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers.The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it.The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against inidual members of the RBS senior management team stick either.Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them.Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost.Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms.At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging.Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession.The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04f6106689ba97e105c76359f0396de745a0337/0_352_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72caff081f7ded30f21132b401aaba46","title":"cruel britannia banter humiliation selfie","story":"If vulnerable people are being targeted for the sake of a selfie, it’s a symptom of a deeper sicknessIt hasn’t been a good 24 hours for British banter merchants. Two incidents reported yesterday demonstrated that if you thought acts committed in the almighty name of bantz couldn’t get any worse, you were wrong. Having hit rock bottom, banter has found a trapdoor in the floor, opened it up and ed in.In Benidorm a group of British tourists on a stag party allegedly paid a homeless man €100 to have the name of the stag tattooed on his face. Pictures of Tomek, a 34-year-old Pole, were put up on social media and then taken down following an outcry. The man whose name appears in the pictures to have been tattooed on Tomek’s forehead says the story has been misreported.In the Suffolk town of Bury St Edmunds, a group of teenage boys allegedly spat at a 49-year-old disabled woman, pelted her with eggs and covered her in flour. Their assault complete, they posed for a series of triumphant selfies. It makes you wonder what might be next for banter.Will the nation’s top bantersaurs live-stream homeless people fighting to the death on their own YouTube channels? Will they throw children that can’t swim into the deep end and take bets on how long they take to drown? Will they rip off the clothes of elderly couples in the supermarket and then pose with them for a series of legendary selfies?The truth is that we are already living in that world. Last January two teenage friends killed a homeless man with a machete because they thought it was “funny”. The murderers were later seen recreating scenes from the attack, laughing as they burned their own clothes.Last year Snapchat footage showed a Cambridge law student in white tie goading a homeless man by trying to burn a £20 note in front of him. Members of Oxford’s exclusive Bullingdon Club – past members include David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson – are said to burn a £50 note in front of a homeless person as part of their initiation.What makes these stories so depressing is the power imbalance. At a time when homelessness and poverty are on the rise and wealth inequality is soaring, banter is here to make the situation bleaker still. Being the victim of banter merchants – who essentially feel that vulnerable people are not fully human and therefore fair game – is part of this equation.It is also a micro example of a macro problem: vulnerable people are treated with contempt by our government, business and public institutions, so why should it be a surprise that they are then treated in the same way by iniduals? The boredom experienced by the banter merchants combines with the insatiable need for social media content in a toxic mix. The removal of inhibitions provided by drink and drugs only adds to this.On that night out in Benidorm, the stag party are said to have found someone they could use to create what they hoped would be a legendary bit of banter, something that would rack up the likes and the views on social media. His feelings were not considered because as a homeless person, he had no power to assert them. This is what we talk about when we talk about toxic masculinity – a macho, narcissistic performance that regards the vulnerable as weak and humiliates them for it.The sadness is not only with the victims, though. There is an emptiness driving these sadistic stories that can’t simply be explained away with a line about bad apples unhinged by drink and drugs. Social media offers everyone the chance to have their 15 minutes of fame, but in doing so encourages people to up the ante – perhaps it’s only by getting a homeless guy to tattoo your mate’s name on his forehead that you are going to get the attention you crave.It speaks, also, to the relative lack of opportunity available to the banter merchants. They have the prospect of puncturing lives of boredom and struggle with moments of performed cruelty. Conducted among a group of relative equals, banter – or something like it – can be a bonding experience, it can give people the feeling of community they long for and doesn’t have to humiliate the vulnerable. The problem is that in our society, the vulnerable are forever targets for humiliation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51dd5135a7598f34cb03a51ff700815922364a5f/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf52d2673f905072d93524f0a8349edf","title":"nightlife is a vital space to shed inhibitions why doesnt britain value it more","story":"East London has gained a bad reputation for its ungodly rents and an over-saturation of people who call themselves trend forecasters. But for decades it has also been the subcultural engine of the UK. It is the birthplace of the Aba Shanti-I sound system, grime and hipsterism. The photographer Gavin Watson described it as rave’s spiritual home and I once saw Rihanna go into a pub on Columbia Road wearing fishnet cycling shorts.Last week, Hackney council did its best to bring that era to a close. In a unanimous decision, it decided to ban all new venues from opening past 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. It is a curfew more familiar to Year 10s who have to call home first if they are going to stay over at someone’s house than to Britain’s supposed nightlife hub.What is particularly galling about the Hackney decision is the way the council is still trying to pretend it is down with the kids. Writing in the  on Friday, Hackney’s mayor Philip Glanville defended the decision, claiming that while he was bang up for a good time, and nightlife “is at the heart of the borough’s creativity”, he also had to think about vomit in the streets, extra policing and a major clearup operation – so if we could all kindly be tucked up in bed before the shipping forecast, that would be tickety-boo.That is the problem with recent half-hearted attempts to save Britain’s nightlife. They are all focused on the abstract concept of cultural value. Clubs are deemed worthy only if they have some artistic output, not in and of themselves – so the Barbican can put on more late nights and cabaret bars are saved while actual clubs continue to close.Certainly, exciting new substrands of dance music can emerge at 5am when someone plays a record at the wrong speed, and certain spaces can become safe havens for marginalised communities. But those can’t be planned for, they are corollaries of a nightclub’s central purpose: to be a space of abandon and freedom where you can be inebriated and uninhibited. Clubs are the engine of the following week’s gossip, over quieter dinners and swift halves. They are the difference between a “fine” and an “oof” when someone asks you how your weekend was on Monday morning.Of course, nobody wants a situation where nightlife is making the lives of other residents a misery, but Glanville’s binary between streets flooded with vomit or an entire borough taking itself to bed at 11pm is bizarre. The problem is bad licensing and poor provision: as more clubs close, the ones that remain become tense and overcrowded. Chain cocktail bars on the same strip of one street all chuck out at the same time, leading to inevitable screaming matches over mistaken Ubers and gin-in-a-tin-fuelled loitering as clubbers realise they have nowhere else to go. If you are lucky, things might continue in someone’s living room – which is probably why there are nearly eight times more noise complaints about residential properties than there are about nightclubs.I have just spent a few months in New York, where nightlife is accessible and relaxed – clubs have DJs playing outside in sweltering back gardens and restaurants open up into dancefloors. It means people – even, gasp, people in their 30s and 40s – have a natural disposition to stay out late, to be with each other, to throw caution to the wind. New York has many problems, but few of them seemed to be caused by bars being open later.Hackney’s decision mirrors similarly draconian rules across the country, from the Glasgow licensing board’s forced closure of the Arches to Westminster council revoking the licence of Soho’s Madame JoJo’s to Mac’s Bar in Preston eventually closing after six years of disputes with the council and the police. If we can’t give some special dispensation to nightlife in one of the most creative boroughs in the capital, where 52 out of the 57 seats are filled by Labour councillors, many of whom will have enjoyed considerable support from young people, what hope is there for venues in Tory districts on the south coast?I have long been a fan of Demi Lovato, a surprising and relentlessly honest singer who has suffered from addiction and severe eating disorders on and off since graduating from her early acting career on the Disney Channel. Last week, she suffered a dangerous overdose, shortly after she released Sober, a song that contains striking lyrical similarities to Amy Winehouse’s Rehab, albeit with a more helpless tone.Of course, some people’s demons will catch up with them whether they are a popstar or working on a supermarket checkout. But it is hard to ignore how often child stars end up having a serious breakdown in their mid-20s. After Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Mary-Kate Olsen, Amanda Bynes, Justin Bieber and Mischa Barton have battled with some combination of addiction, mental health issues and eating disorders, you wonder why anyone would let their child sign away their life to tween stardom.The past year has reminded us how cruel Hollywood can be to women, but does there need to be a reckoning over how it treats children, too? An increasing number of former Disney stars have said they sustained psyschological trauma at the network. Selena Gomez, a close friend of Lovato’s, has said: “It’s really dysfunctional to be in this industry at a young age where you’re figuring out who you are. I don’t recommend it.” Cole Sprouse, another Disney graduate, has said he developed “horrifying” anxiety from being “raised on a sound stage” and sought to dissuade others from following in his footsteps.Must the house of Mickey Mouse take some of the blame for what happens to its stars after they leave the channel? If the gloves fit.I have just got back from New York, where you can order 39 different flavours of cream cheese and the streets are paved with high-fructose corn syrup. I was quite looking forward to escaping yet another glum July – yet I have apparently missed the Summer of Our Lives™. I expected a thunderstorm of schadenfreude but one never materialised. Instead, I was flooded with Instagrams of seemingly endless summer nights, grim parts of the Thames becoming emergency swimming spots and, for a while at least, a bizarre national sense of unity at the suggestion that football was coming home. It is easy to be down on Brexit Britain, but I admit I felt pangs of homesickness watching topless lads singing the Lightning Seeds on top of a suburban bus stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5a0778b58f9c922730ea5f257d84ff61312071/0_41_5079_3049/master/5079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5f6683a19a0787b2cb3dc1b35f293e","title":"the guardian view on labours misguided priorities lead on brexit and prepare for government","story":"Roger Oldham’s delightful 1906 “Manchester Alphabet” consists of a comical collection of 26 drawings and rhymes woven around daily life in Manchester.

A vibrant Labour party has rarely been more essential in British political life than today, with Britain facing increasing turmoil because of the Brexit vote and polarised by widening social and economic inequalities. The need for a focused and hopeful alternative to Theresa May’s feeble, small-minded and Brexit-dominated government could hardly be more obvious.For that reason, a candid friend must express anxiety and concern about some of Labour’s current preoccupations. It is too turned in on itself at a time when the British people need clearer leadership, above all on Brexit. To spend its time arguing within itself about definitions of antisemitism, an issue on which the party has a long and proud record and on which it has previously been united, is a self-inflicted wound at a time of such social and international crisis. To regard the deselection or disciplining of Labour MPs as a priority with only weeks to go before the Conservatives and the DUP attempt to drag Britain out of a European Union that has underpinned peace and prosperity in our part of the world for nearly 70 years will strike many Labour voters as a\u0026nbsppiece of terrible self-indulgence.This country deserves better from its principal party of opposition than this. It deserves, most pressingly, a more decisive lead on Brexit, setting out a credible and consistent vision for the economy, for jobs, on preserving the soft Irish border and acknowledging the realities of this country’s place in Europe. It also deserves to hear far more about a party that is ready for government, with a programme of economic, social and political reform. Labour has helped to win the argument against austerity among the population at large. The country now needs to learn what can replace it. Labour should be offering radical alternatives, explaining how they fit together and how they can be financed. We do not doubt that the Conservatives deserve to lose the next general election. The anxiety is that, in its current mood and with its present priorities, Labour is not doing enough to deserve to win it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98532698a3fc71224b0f85a4e5fa461bc4900d1f/0_467_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd651a04166be74a0042db947210cb4","title":"monty python amorous pink knight unseen sketches revealed","story":"Material from Michael Palin’s archives was written for Holy Grail but they had too many ideas to get in one movieUnseen sketches from Monty Python have been discovered in the archives of Michael Palin.The comedy group of Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Terry Jones produced their last film 35 years ago but boxes of material have now emerged, according to the Times.The material, deposited at the British Library in 2017, has been revealed to contain unused script ideas including two sketches written for Monty Python and the Holy Grail.One of the sketches is about a Wild West bookshop while another features an “amorous Pink Knight”. They will go on display to the public along with more than 50 notebooks containing notes on two of the Pythons’ films, Holy Grail and Life Of Brian. Material deemed controversial at the time was reportedly discarded and would still be seen as too risque today.Palin, 75, has given permission for the sketches to be reproduced and admitted the group often produced more material than was needed.“Sometimes you have things like that.

Sabry Mosbah from Tunisia, Wazimbo from Mozambique and members of Niger’s Tal National were prevented from entering the UK, Smith said. Indian sisters Hashmat Sultana, who also experienced difficulties entering the country, arrived 24 hours after their scheduled performance.Gabriel, who co-founded Womad in 1980, said: “The right to travel for work, for education and even for pleasure is increasingly being restricted and often along racial and religious lines.Smith said it was the latest example of the government’s “hostile environment” policy affecting international acts scheduled to perform in the UK. He said this year marked the first time artists declined invitations to perform at Womad, with many citing the difficulty of entering the country under the automated visa system that first created issues for the festival in 2017.“Whether their perceptions are real or inflamed, the reality is that artists are deciding that the hassle and cost of entering the UK are neither worth the return nor the exposure to rejection that the process might bring,” Smith said. “For now this is a trickle, but how do we prevent it becoming a flood?”Womad asked Home Office and Foreign Office contacts to intervene in inidual cases, which led to some visa cancellations being overturned. “Sometimes this works but not consistently,” said Smith. “At Womad it is our intention to embark on urgent discussions with our contacts at the Home Office and our partners in the cultural sector to find a way to welcome international artists and ask them to continue their contribution to making the UK a tolerant and forward-thinking focal point of the global cultural community.”Gabriel said: “There have been, and continue to be, good people within the Foreign Office who try to help us every year, but the warnings are becoming clearer: if we want a country which is open to people with ideas, traditions, food and culture different from our own, we have to change the current visa processes and find ways to turn back the growing anti-foreigner tide.“Musicians travel for a living, and almost everywhere I have travelled I have been met with kindness and generosity. Do we really want a white-breaded Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?”Freedom of movement for musicians has come under scrutiny since the EU referendum vote. Last week the House of Lords published a report recommending a “touring visa” which would improve access to the EU for British performers post-Brexit and vice versa.Smith questioned whether the hostile environment policy reflected the will of the nation. “I strongly believe it is not how British people feel, and the 35,000 people who attended the Womad festival last weekend agree. “Britain is a country built on a foundation of erse cultures it is a country that respects and is excited by ersity and a country that wants to take its place on the global stage.” “Tragically, this is not the message that is being projected beyond our borders and the potential damage to our communities, culture and economy as a consequence of that is, frankly, heartbreaking.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy kimmel rudy giuliani rabies late night","story":"Comics discussed sexual harassment claims against Les Moonves and Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Giuliani’s evolving defense of TrumpLate-night hosts on Monday discussed the sexual harassment allegations against CBS chairman Les Moonves, Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, and Rudy Giuliani’s evolving defense of Donald Trump.“I heard there was an article about CBS chairman and man-I hope-isn’t-watching-tonight’s-monologue, Les Moonves,” began Stephen Colbert, who joked that the reporter behind the story, Ronan Farrow, told him all he needed to know.“Ronan isn’t exactly known for his puff pieces about glamping,” said the host. “The CBS board met today and announced they’re in the process of hiring outside investigators. I don’t know why they’re outsourcing this: they could just use the cast of the new CBS procedural: CSI: CEO.”Colbert went on: “There’s also, by the way, allegations against somebody I don’t work for, because last week we learned that Kimebrly Guilfoyle allegedly left Fox News amid accusations of sexual misconduct.”According to sources, Colbert explained, Guilfoyle has been accused of showing personal photographs of male genitalia to colleagues and identifying whose genitals they were. “Which is horrible workplace behavior,” said the host, “and also the least popular edition of the board game Guess Who?”“This story becomes way more interesting when you know Guilfoyle is currently dating presidential son and man-reacting-to-his-girlfriend’s-photo-collage Donald Trump Jr,” said Colbert. “Which means, and brace yourself for this, there’s a good chance Guilfoyle was forcing people to look at Don’s junior.”Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah discussed reports that Robert Mueller is looking at president Trump’s tweets in his ongoing obstruction of justice investigation.“Late last week, it was reported that the Mueller investigation has entered a new phase,” began Noah. “Even though Mueller hasn’t been able to interview the president yet, last week he figured out how to do the next best thing.”After showing news coverage about Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s tweets, Noah said: “I know some people are saying this is ridiculous, but remember: the president told us many times that @realdonaldtrump is the real Donald Trump.”The host then cut to videos of Trump saying Twitter is his way of “bypassing dishonest media” and getting his message out. Noah joked: “When Mueller does finally get Trump into court, forget the Bible, they should make him swear on his phone.” The host then briefly plugged The Daily Show’s own book, the Donald J Trump Presidential Twitter Library, an organized compilation of Trump’s tweets.“Investigating Trump’s tweets for obstruction of justice is a good idea, but you don’t have to go on Twitter to do it,” said Noah. “Because we at The Daily Show have already combed through Trump’s tweets and we’ve come up with our own definitive analysis.” “And it turns out,” Noah concluded, “Crooked Hillary and the FBI are the real Russians.”Meanwhile, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel discussed Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani’s appearances on cable news, where he tore into Michael Cohen and argued collusion is not a crime.He began: “The president lashed out at his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the potentially devastating claim last week that Trump had advance knowledge about the infamous meeting between his son and the Russians at Trump Tower.”Kimmel then read aloud Trump’s tweet in which he slammed Cohen for retaining former Clinton attorney Lanny Davis as his lawyer. “That is interesting,” said Kimmel, noting that Trump’s own defense team includes Emmet Flood, a former Clinton impeachment lawyer. “Who in this situation would hire one of Bill and crooked Hillary’s lawyers? Oh, wait a minute, you did!”“Cohen must have something good because the president’s attack dog Rudy Giuliani was all over TV this weekend calling him a liar,” said the host, showing a clip of Giuliani claiming Cohen has “lied all his life” and is “an inherent, pathological liar.” Two months earlier in a television interview, Giuliani called Cohen an “honest, honorable lawyer.”“I think Rudy Giuliani might have rabies,” Kimmel quipped.“On top of all this, this morning on Fox, Rudy added a new twist, questioning whether collusion is even a crime,” Kimmel noted, before showing a clip fo Giuliani and Fox \u0026amp Friends host Steve Doocy agreeing that collusion is not illegal.“Say what you like about Rudy,” said Kimmel, “but when it comes to collusion he has been nothing if not consistent.”The host went on to dig up past videos of Giuliani saying allegations of collusion are “fake news” and not supported by “a stitch of evidence.”Kimmel concluded: “He’s gone from no one in the Trump campaign had any contact with Russians, to a few people might have met with some Russians but they talked about adoption, to, okay, they were talking about helping Trump win the election but they weren’t colluding to, even if they were colluding, not a crime.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740bce887f702768d746e6cec7ed754a38717a40/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71daab108e45c99f487cbfea3a17761","title":"chinas most populous area could be uninhabitable by end of century","story":"The most populous region of the biggest polluter on Earth – China’s northern plain – will become uninhabitable in places if climate change is not curbedThe deadliest place on the planet for extreme future heatwaves will be the north China plain, one of the most densely populated regions in the world and the most important food-producing area in the huge nation.New scientific research shows that humid heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike the area repeatedly towards the end of the century thanks to climate change, unless there are heavy cuts in carbon emissions. “This spot is going to be the hottest spot for deadly heatwaves in the future,” said Prof Elfatih Eltahir, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, who led the new study. The projections for China’s northern plain are particularly worrying because many of the region’s 400 million people are farmers and have little alternative to working outside.“China is currently the largest contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases, with potentially serious implications to its own population,” he said. “Continuation of current global emissions may limit the habitability of the most populous region of the most populous country on Earth.”The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, which is measured as the “wet bulb” temperature (WBT). Once the WBT reaches 35C, the air is so hot and humid that the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade die within six hours. A WBT above 31C is classed by the US National Weather Service as “extreme danger”, with its warning stating: “If you don’t take precautions immediately, you may become seriously ill or even die.”The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, found fatal WBTs of 35C would strike the north China plain repeatedly between 2070 and 2100, unless carbon emissions are cut. Shanghai, for example, would exceed the fatal threshold about five times and the “extreme danger” WBTs would occur hundreds of times. Even if significant carbon cuts are made, the “extreme danger” WBT would be exceeded many times.The scientists also analysed south Asia in 2017 and found it too is at risk of killer 35C WBT heatwaves in places. Even outside the extreme hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population – particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys – would be exposed to “extreme danger” levels of humid heat towards the end of the century.Prof Chris Huntingford, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and not involved in the study, said: “The research finds that if greenhouse emissions continue at current levels, there will be many more days when unsafe thresholds are crossed. This will make work outdoors almost impossible across much of the agricultural regions of China.”“Work like this is especially useful, as it allows governments to plan better future agricultural practices, including what is needed to support farmers to operate safely and thus ensure food security,” he said.The most extreme temperatures in all the analyses were found in the Gulf, but those occurred over the sea. In the case of the north China plain, Eltahir said: “This is where people live.”Climate change is the key driver, but the massive irrigation used on crops on the north China plain was found to be significant too, adding about 0.5C to the high WBTs. This is because the evaporation of irrigation water leads to higher humidity and because water vapour is itself a powerful greenhouse gas.The scientists did the analysis by running detailed computer climate models for the past 30 years on the north China plain. Those models that closely replicated the actual measurements were then used to project the climate of the region from 2070-2100 for different levels of carbon emissions.Even with cuts in greenhouse gases, Eltahir said public health measures would be needed in China, such as air-conditioned shelters and education of the population about the dangers of extreme heat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e451fa130ffa6d346b8a2c1ac0b22b839b9693b5/738_271_940_564/master/940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a678b740cb0f55e30cd3a2fd979e2de","title":"efl managers red yellow cards","story":"Managers will receive red and yellow cards this season in a bid to clean up touchline behaviour. Although Premier League managers will only receive verbal cautions for “irresponsible behaviour” in the coming campaign, in the FA Cup, Football League, Carabao Cup, EFL Trophy and National League, they will be shown cards.The EFL has said that the change of rules, piloting an International Football Association Board (Ifab) scheme will help “protect the reputation” of its competitions. Meanwhile, the Premier League will adopt the same rules of “accumulated stage 1 warnings” – any activity by the manager or his staff in the technical area considered irresponsible by the match official – but verbally and without the use of cards.Managers will receive yellow cards for incidents such as kicking a water bottle, sarcastic clapping or any other gesture that could be considered as attempting to undermine the match official. A red card would be handed out for actions such as violent conduct, spitting and stopping the opponent restarting play. The manager would also be culpable for punishment should any member of his or her staff in the technical area or dugout be deemed to have behaved irresponsibly. Only the match official – not assistants or the fourth official – will have the power to issue cards to a manager, although there is a hope that, over time, that could change.The EFL’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said: “If the behaviour of any one of the members on the bench, usually led by the manager, gets to the level where it’s not appropriate, as like a caution on the pitch, the referee will issue a yellow card to the bench.“If the behaviour continues in a manner that he doesn’t feel appropriate – effectively like a totting up of a number of fouls – then there’s the opportunity for a second yellow card to be issued at which stage the manager leaves the bench area. If there’s a serious incident deemed by the match official, the manager will be shown a red card and go to the stands. It will hopefully improve behaviour in the technical areas. This is not about creating a drama. It is about making sure behaviour doesn’t decline further.”If a manager accumulates four yellow cards, they would receive an automatic one-match ban, eight a two-match ban, 12 a three-match ban and 16 or more would result in a visit to Wembley to sit in front of a Football Association disciplinary panel. Subsequent fines or stadium bans for repeat offenders – if deemed appropriate – also will be determined by the FA. There will also be an end-of-season amnesty to avoid managers missing matches of great magnitude.Harvey added: “We don’t want managers missing play-off games and play-off finals because he has had four warnings.”Harvey hopes the rules will have an impact far beyond the Football League, including at grassroots level. “Professional football forms opinions and is what people look up to what professional footballers do and indeed managers do is often deemed as being the acceptable norm,” he said. “We do hope this changes the behaviour away from the professional game as well. But, we have to start somewhere, this is the pilot and hopefully it will be something that is followed by everybody else in the future.”Ifab has said the experiment was designed to make it possible “for disciplinary action to be taken against persistent offenders”. The measures, which will also be implemented in the Checkatrade Trophy and National League competitions, will be introduced from Friday, when Reading play Derby County in the Championship season opener."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b0e28632bf637a8e6edee0a62888fd4e17f92a/0_247_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e027497e9b54de0415d97a38005f447","title":"manchester united v real madrid international champions cup live","story":"The first three minutes of the Barcelona-Roma game had more action than the entire second half of this one.

They concede a corner.90 min: Nearly the same situation, and this time, they shoot. Shot hits a red wall. Only three minutes of stoppage time.Then out of nowhere, Nacho unleashes the best shot of the half, just going over the bar and nestling in the top netting from 25 yards out.89 min: Real Madrid set up a promising opportunity to shoot. They pass. Sigh.88 min: Stats thus far -- Manchester United have six shots, three of them on target. I honestly can’t remember the third.Real Madrid have 13 shots, two on goal. One was a goal, the other was a free kick from a tough angle that would’ve hit De Gea’s head had he not punched it clear.But Madrid have surely completed hundreds more passes.87 min: Paul Moody asks, “if utd win what will media angle be on ongoing mourinho crisis.”83 min: A final change for United (because you can only make substitutions at three distinct times in this competition), and we’ll see James Garner, known to American audiences as the star of The Rockford Files. 81 min: A rare United foray forward ends with a e. Meh.At the other end, Isco chips it for RDT, who tries to pull it back across the box.Then CHANCE -- and two Real players collide while trying to get to the ball in the 6-yard box.79 min: McTominay takes a boot to the head.

Then back to business as usual.69 min: A touch at last for Real Madrid’s second-half keeper ... oh no ... what was his name? Ah yes, Andriy Lunin, a teenager signed from Ukraine’s Zorya Luhansk.

Also, I hate Sergio Ramos.Is anyone awake in the UK to answer the question? About Slurpees, not about Sergio Ramos. 57 min: CHANCE -- The crowd has started to recognize the good things that happen when Vinicius has the ball. In this case, it’s a shot that Odegaard blasts over the bar from close range.55 min: A brilliant catch by ... a supporter in a plain white T-shirt maybe 20 rows behind the goal. Javi Sanchez will not make the case for inclusion in Real’s senior team with that effort.54 min: A long ball finds Mayoral in the United box, but he is quickly swarmed by players in red.53 min: Still Real possession, still no real shots. 50 min: Real Madrid with several minutes of possession. Fred gets the ball and is dispossessed, leading to a powerful shot just wide, but the referee tells us Fred was fouled in the process.48 min: Real Madrid squander a free kick so quickly the cameras didn’t even catch it. They were busy showing us the foul -- Pereira on Odegaard. De Gea comes out to play the ball with his left foot, sending it out of play, which was probably the best possible outcome.46 min: Out for Real Madrid -- Bale, Benzema, Casilla (the keeper) and Theo Hernández.No, the second half hasn’t actually started yet. I should’ve gone out for a Slurpee at halftime.Time to play “spot the second-half subs”! Ready, everyone?Halftime stats give Real Madrid a 66-34 possession edge. Weren’t those roughly the same numbers we saw when Spain played Russia?So every time I say the game has hit a lull, the opposite happens. Let’s see if I can use these powers for good ...All three of these will now be untrue, right?Just a superb buildup -- a backheel, a cross inside the 6-yard box and Benzema sticks out a foot to redirect it past De Gea.45+1 min: Shaw brings down Odriozola for some reason, but the United defense copes with a rather half-hearted attack. Maybe Real are content to let Isco, Kroos and company lead the comeback after halftime.45 min: And whenever I say we have a lull, Manchester United unlock the Real defense. A good give-and-go, and Real are forced to head the ball out for a corner.We’ll have four minutes of stoppage time thanks to the water break and whatever was ailing Bailly.44 min: This continues to be a game of spurts and lulls, and we’re currently in the latter.42 min: Might not be a cramp after all, as a replay shows the ball that was deflected out for a corner may have deflected off the part of the body players guard when they’re in the wall for a free kick. The corner is finally taken to no effect.41 min: And we have our second cramp of the night. Appears to be Bailly.40 min: And we have our first cramp of the night. Appears to be Bailly.39 min: Real Madrid enjoying possession between the midfield stripe and the top of the box. Then Bale finds Llorente in the box, and the end result is a corner.36 min: Nothing of interest. Fred hasn’t played badly, but he has been mostly invisible while the quick strikes have been provided by Alexis, Herrera et al.34 min: The game has resumed. In fairness, it is rather humid in Miami. That’s because it’s ... Miami. Stuart Graves writes: “The “e” on Bale’s shirt is an English pound sign – lol.” Wouldn’t it be a Euro? Looks like fans are working out the parking issues ... The reaction shots after the Herrera goal were priceless. Tons of United supporters looking on in disbelief. Too stunned to smile.31 min: CHANCE-ish. Or maybe Bale is just impatient, whipping in a shot from outside the box and over the bar.And we get a water break, though it’s hotter in much of Europe right now than it is here in the USA.30 min: Bale wins a corner against a succession of sliding United defenders. The near and far posts are not guarded, but the ball is not near a player in white."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325843324f915776717a611beaa1486ec0141fba/0_174_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc84335652b4dc5795aae7c7c9bb40d","title":"gym new nightclub party workouts sweat crawls friends","story":"Millennials are giving up pubs for fitness studios, meeting friends at ‘party workouts’ and ‘sweat crawls’. Is this the end of the boozy night out?Every morning at 5.45am, 27-year-old fashion designer Kelly Walker wakes up and begins her morning commute. First, she makes an hour-long trip from south London to central London to attend a boutique fitness studio – F45 Training, a high-intensity import from Australia with a cult-like following. She takes the 7am class, then heads to the tube and travels for another hour to her office in west London to be at her desk for 9am.“It’s a tour of London!” Walker laughs. And it is one she has been making for the past 18 months. What makes her willing to add two hours on to her commute to go to a gym? Mostly, it’s the buzz of working out with friends. Her housemate and two friends also attend. “It’s good because you actually get up to go. It makes it more enjoyable,” Walker says. “Even though it makes no sense practically.”Traditionally, British socialising revolved around the two Bs: boozing and bitching about the weather. But now a third B is muscling in: boutique gyms. While a jog around the park or a monthly Zumba class is far cheaper, fitness fanatics with disposable cash can now spend it on interval training in LED-lit rooms with more sparkle than Studio 54.In fact, for some, the gym is replacing boozing. Young people are drinking less than ever before: according to one survey, more than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal. A quarter of pubs have closed in the past 35 years, and those that survive largely do so through their food offerings.Scott credits our health-conscious times for the success of her concept. “I think the bar and brunch thing is going away,” she says. “People are making decisions to do things that are healthier, rather than spending their weekends eating and drinking.”After class, there are waiting glasses of prosecco in the bar. For 38-year-old Vicky Sampson, party workouts such as these are a way to have all the fun but none of the guilt of a drinking session. “You don’t have a hangover the next day, and it’s better for you than going to the pub. Especially how Trib3 does it. It feels more like you’re in a disco.”Another class member, 27-year-old dentist Rihanna Fulford, says: “Three years ago, if you’d told me, ‘You’ll make loads of friends at the gym,’ I’d have laughed at you.” Now, Fulford says, she is a convert, regularly taking back-to-back HIIT classes. She is endearingly self-aware about her conversion. “I used to laugh at people in gyms,” she admits. Now she exercises nine times a week and is going to a spa next weekend with a friend from the gym. “I even came here on Boxing Day in a Santa outfit, still drunk with half a bottle of Baileys in me,” she says. “It was wonderful.”Hayes, a PR manager specialising in fitness, recently joined Instagram to share pictures of her workouts. To her surprise, it has become a valuable networking tool. “People see your workouts and message you and say: ‘Can we train together?’,” Hayes says. “It’s weird how many people you meet.”Mintel’s Helen Fricker says: “It’s a lot easier for young people to get information about health and fitness through social media. You can learn about trends almost instantly, and they spread really quickly.” From fitness influencers such as Adrienne Herbert, who was recently named the “face of wellness” by British Vogue, to the social media goliath Kayla Itsines, who has 9.9 million Instagram followers and an estimated net worth ofA$63m (£35.5m), social media reinforces and refracts our new obsession.Workout trends such as CrossFit or F45 tend to arrive in the UK from the fitness epicentres of Australia or Los Angeles. Alongside social media, private investors help to spread them across the country.“People say we’re the Soho House of the fitness world,” says Deborah Hughes of Third Space, a private member’s club-cum-gym in London. The pricy membership is about £140 a month. For that, you can make like an elite athlete and have your body fat scanned and, for an extra fee, your blood checked.I follow Hughes through a maze of rooms (a reformer pilates studio that looks like a sex dungeon! A boxing gym! A medical centre staffed by Harley Street doctors!). We go into a hypoxic chamber that mimics the conditions of training at altitude. It is all absurd, but everything aspirational is absurd: if Sex and the City were written today, Carrie and co would relocate from cocktail bars to boutique gyms. And something in the Aesop-scented air is catching. I find myself calculating whether I can afford to join Third Space’s new Fenchurch Street club (I cannot).Private investors continue to funnel money into the sector. The upscale gym brand Equinox will open its first hotel in New York in 2019. In the UK, Third Space – backed by the private equity firm Encore Capital – is planning a £50m, five-year expansion. Several luxury pay-as-you-go studios have opened new London venues this year, including Frame, Boom Cycle, Ten, Digme Fitness and Barrecore.“We’ve seen a massive explosion of boutique gym operators entering the UK market,” says Richard Griston of Knight Frank estate agents. “I had a studio in Marylebone where an international brand was willing to offer £80 a square foot. It was crazy.”Some fear the industry could be heading for a crash. “My word of caution is on the rents,” Griston says. He references restaurant chains that were also pumped full of private equity money – such as Carluccio’s, Jamie’s Italian and Prezzo – and are struggling. “People paid huge amounts of money and it has come back to bite them because it wasn’t sustainable.”Industry burnout or not, the normalisation of fitness as a social activity shows no sign of slowing down.

The ASA said in its ruling: “Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express’s control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express’s control. As such, we concluded that the claims ‘non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour’ and ‘in just 30 minutes’ had not been substantiated and were misleading.”Separately, the ASA also banned a Eurostar ad campaign promoting £29 fares for trains to France. A complainant said they had been unable to find a ticket for London to Paris at that price. The watchdog investigated and found that only a very small percentage of the promotional tickets were made available, and travellers would have to book as far as 18 weeks in advance to have the best chance of getting them.In 2015, the ASA ruled that the Heathrow Express had to drop its claim that the train ran “every 15 minutes” after a customer complained that the frequency dropped to once every 30 minutes late in the day.A Gatwick Express spokesman said: “Just a third of Gatwick Express delay minutes were within our control, however we acknowledge the ASA ruling and began withdrawing these adverts many months ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267d0525d5c19ac70f3fa0e51a1f326381282383/0_61_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce85b35e4318a722bd04dfe57898049","title":"jarvis cocker to take on bez in bargain hunt special edition","story":"Pulp singer and bandmate Candida Doyle will face Happy Mondays pair in BBC TV showJarvis Cocker is to appear on a special edition of Bargain Hunt in a bid to defeat the Happy Mondays and prove his band has the best eye in British music for cheap antiques.The Pulp singer will be accompanied by bandmate Candida Doyle as the pair search for low-value goods to sell on at auction in the longrunning BBC TV programme.

Did prejudice hamper the search for justice? By  Tobias JonesIt was raining heavily on 28 March 2018, as Alessandro Albini’s officers were raking over rough ground on the outskirts of an abandoned building. The police were looking for stashes of drugs or money, because they knew the shack was being used by dealers.At first glance, this might have seemed an unlikely location for a drugs bust. Porto Recanati is a small seaside town on Italy’s Adriatic coast. It has perpendicular streets with low, pastel-coloured palazzi between palms and maritime pines. It’s all very neat: there are often mini-diggers on the sand, raking the beach flat as if it were a Japanese garden.One of Albini’s men called him over. “There’s something strange here,” he said. The rain had washed away the loose soil and what looked like a golf ball was sticking out of the ground. Albini’s colleague took a cloth and wiped away the mud so that he could see the thick bone of what appeared to be a femur.Forensic experts were called in, and for two weeks Albini, the town’s vice questore (the deputy chief constable), oversaw the sifting of 15 cubic metres of ground, which contained a lot of buried garbage and animal bones, but also other remains that seemed human.The abandoned building was five minutes inland from the sea, close to the town’s tiny stadium with its single west stand. But it was only a field away from what is possibly the most fascinating and perplexing building in Italy: Hotel House, a semi-derelict tower block that has become synonymous, in the Italian imagination, with drug dealing, prostitution and clandestine migrants.Given that reputation, there was press speculation that this might be a mass burial site. Every day local, then national, journalists came to lean over the red-and-white tape to shout questions to the forensics crew.Hotel House is shaped like a Y, with three red-coloured wings, each 17 stories high and covered by the rusting sequins of satellite dishes. There are 480 apartments, but nobody knows how many people live here. In the summer, when large numbers of Bangladeshi and Senegalese people come to the area to work as beach vendors, the number probably surpasses 3,000. There are only a handful of Italians still living in the block. All eight of its lifts are broken, there is no piped drinking water, the sewage is backing up and there are holes in the walls and floors on every level.Hotel House has been compared to Scampia – the famous Naples estate featured in the film Gomorrah – and the former Olympic village in Turin: high-concept architectural projects that have, over time, become dystopian citadels for drug dealers and an Italian and immigrant underclass. These are places where honest destitution mixes with criminal wealth, and where the Italian state often appears to have lost control completely.For almost a century, Italy was one of Europe’s largest sources of emigrants. But by the early 1990s, immigration to Italy had accelerated rapidly, and some places with high immigrant populations developed serious problems with crime – which in turn provoked outrage among many Italians. Matteo Salvini’s far-right Lega party swept to power this spring by exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment, even posing for a photo opportunity a few years ago at Hotel House.Italy’s various law enforcement agencies do attempt to police Hotel House, but with so many flats and people, plus multiple stairwells and underground garages, finding evidence of criminal activity is almost impossible. “By the time we get to the top of one stairwell,” one officer told me, “the stash has been moved to another wing. They’re very sly.”There are occasional busts, after which photos of clingfilmed bricks of hash or torpedo-shaped wraps of heroin or cocaine will be proudly shown off. One recent investigation discovered that about €450,000 was being transferred to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan every month from a wire service on the ground floor of Hotel House. Often there were multiple transfers to the same person in one day, indicating that it was a restocking exercise. The drug trade inside Hotel House is estimated to be worth between €5m and €10m a year – not huge figures, but in a building in which poverty and degradation are everywhere, still pretty astonishing.Almost every week there’s a major incident at Hotel House. Recently these have included a suicide attempt, a Moroccan man beaten into a coma on a Saturday night, a fire, a police bust that turned up 28,000 items of counterfeit clothing, and another that found 120g of cocaine. The discovery of human remains so close to the building was just the latest in a long line of bad news.Despite constant horror stories in the press, Hotel House doesn’t feel particularly edgy at first. As you approach the block from the sea, you walk through a shady boulevard of mature lime trees, and sunflowers poke their manes above a wheatfield. Next to the building is a large car park and car cemetery, containing dozens of dented, unmarked white vans. There is a constant stream of cyclists and pedestrians walking to and from town, and as you get closer you hear screams of laughter from children playing. Beyond the pedestrian barriers, Pakistani men sit on the concrete benches, and around the corner North Africans occupy plastic chairs. One time when I visited, a white woman with a grey crew-cut was shouting amiably at Tunisian labourers working to fix some pipes in a trench. The air all around smells of grey water and rotting food.The porter’s lodge has a mirror window. The porters aren’t official, because the building has been in the hands of a judicially appointed administrator since 2015. But Luca, Ibrahim, Abid and Moustaffa sit in their office gruffly watching the comings and goings. Their powers are limited, but not insignificant: they liaise with the press and police, and hold various keys.All around the ground floor are notices in Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali and Arabic: appeals to raise money to repatriate a corpse, or posters asking residents to fork out for repairs. You can glimpse faded grandeur in the beige marble flooring, which is now covered by cigarette butts, cotton buds and empty bottles.Survival means minding your own business. Enzo, a Tuscan glass-blower who has lived here since 2001, says: “I don’t look, but just pass by.” Many apartment doors are posted with repossession orders, but others have been prettified with stencils or shells and pieces of driftwood. Most of the landings are full of rubbish: dirty mattresses, rusting fridges, ripped bin liners, plastic toys. At the end of each corridor is a view that gets more spectacular the higher you go.You know what floor you’re on by the numbers spray-painted on (or scratched into) the walls. There’s a lot of graffiti in English: “fuck this is not the truth”, and “I’m alone I’m fine”. There are philosophical asides in Italian, too: “The people who ruined this country wear ties, not tattoos.”It’s estimated that there are about 50 full-time drug dealers here – buying, cutting, bagging and slinging. Not everyone on the higher floors is a criminal, but it is like an inverse of Dante’s layers of hell: the higher you go, the darker it feels. Many doors have been damaged in previous busts. There are rugby-ball-sized holes in the walls and floors. You can see those white vans far below now, nothing more than maggots. Even here there are toddlers playing catch, laughing and smiling next to a window hanging on by a single hinge.Franca, the woman with the grey crew-cut, lives on the 13th floor. She is fired up about the “potential” of this place. One floor above her is Otello, an ex-missionary who now repairs electronic goods for residents and gives his homemade jams to kids who help him get his shopping up all those stairs. Many of the flats are immaculate inside: the public space is horrific, but the private is spotless.On the top floor, you’re almost 100 metres up, the sea breeze blasting through the empty window frames. From here the sea is two-tone: turquoise and almost purple. Next to the lift, a fuse box hangs open, with hundreds of coloured wires spilling out. You’re more conscious, at this height, that the rusting fire escape that serves the entire east wing has been locked off.It was never supposed to be like this. Hotel House was given its odd name because its architect, Antonio Sperimenti, was offering purchasers the chance to “live between domestic walls with all the services of a grand hotel”. Inaugurated in 1968, the building made you feel like you were in the Hilton: the reception featured a bronze lift plate, lush red carpets and large house plants. The ground floors were filled with fashion and food outlets, and even a Bulgari shop.The flats were all identical – 60 sq metres inside, with 18 sq metres of balcony. The ones looking out to sea were the most expensive, but the other way wasn’t bad either. To the west you could enjoy sunsets over the hills and, in the distance, the Sibillini mountains.The design was inspired by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, and by the French utopianist Charles Fourier’s notion of a phalanstère, an ideal residence for a community of 1,600 people. It was deliberately monumental, dwarfing the more usual two- and three-storey apartment buildings in town.The lure of the seaside wasn’t just sunbathing and seafood. There were religious and literary attractions to Porto Recanati: the famous Loreto shrine is a short drive inland, and one of Italy’s most famous poets, Giacomo Leopardi, was born here.Outside the main cities of Pescara and Ancona, much of Le Marche’s coast used to be bare marshland with long pine forests. But in the 1970s many new hotels and high-rises were built. Long, sandy beaches were privatised, offering grid-formation deckchairs to sunbathers. New roads were built, including a bypass alongside the railway. But Hotel House was just the wrong side of both. As the town modernised, the building began to seem dated, and stuck on the wrong side of the tracks.When Italy went through a major recession in the late 1980s and early 90s, many families with second homes had to sell up. Suddenly there was a glut of Hotel House flats on the market, and local businessmen snapped them up. One man from the next village came to own 30 of them. Many others were repossessed by banks.Residents started to fall behind on their contributions to the spese condominiali – the shared expenses of the block. Some slum landlords charged the communal costs to their tenants, but never passed them on.With increasing numbers of flats in absentee hands, residents’ meetings were no longer well-attended. Italian law requires a majority of owners’ votes for a building’s budget to be formally approved, and if it isn’t approved, everyone is exempt from paying the communal fees. Soon the maintenance costs could no longer be met.By the 2000s, many of the original owners of Hotel House’s flats had died, and their descendents usually tried to sell up. You could still, in 2000, get roughly €60,000 for a flat there. Enzo, the glass-blower, bought his in 2001. If owners couldn’t sell, they rented them out cheaply, which made the place more of a magnet for the poor. The majority of newcomers were Senegalese, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Tunisian. Almost all looked for and found work: the men in Ancona’s shipyards or as builders, and the women as carers, nurses, waitresses and cleaners.A mosque opened on the ground floor and appointed an imam who was also a great baker. Nigerian Christians worshipped in the boiler room. A halal butcher opened. Soon there were so many Muslims that the Italian bar-owner would shut for Ramadan, since it was pointless to stay open. Cheap rent wasn’t the only attraction for migrant workers: in high season, the beaches were full of holidaymakers keen to buy sunglasses, sarongs and bangles. Thus every summer the immigrant population of Hotel House increased exponentially as incoming workers kipped on friends’ or gangmasters’ floors.In 2008, all of the lifts were still working. But then recession hit again, and apartment prices fell further. There was now a noticeable criminal element in the block, pimping and drug dealing. Two of the lifts stopped working, and there was no money to repair them. Mismanagement of communal maintenance funds had created a debt of hundreds of thousands of euros.There was also a logistical difficulty: because all the flats were in private hands, Hotel House was unlike other notorious estates across Europe, many of which were run by the state. The regional government couldn’t intervene and invest in improvements without appearing to subsidise slum landlords and banks with public money.As debts to utility companies increased, services were slowly cut off: one by one, the lifts stopped working and weren’t repaired. The water supply was switched off in 2008. An illegal well was sunk outside, which has served all the flats ever since. The water is undrinkable, but can be used for washing. Many doubtless use it to cook, as getting gallons of water up multiple floors is too much effort. Drinking water comes from a truck in the car park, at which a constant stream of people queue up to refill plastic demijohns and jerrycans.The cost of not having functioning lifts is almost worse than the lack of water. An old man died last winter because he wanted to catch his breath one night before tackling the steps. He sat on the bench and fell asleep, where he died of exposure. Many elderly residents are prisoners in their own homes, enjoying the sensational views of the sea, but never able to go there again. Lamine Cisse, a Senegalese porter, fell eight floors to his death three years ago, when he stepped into the shaft to try and fix a lift. His widow and child went back to Senegal. Some people have told me that he was an honest, hardworking man who was trying to tackle drug dealing, and that his death was suspicious. He would never have been so stupid, they say, as to attempt to fix a lift inside an eight-storey drop.Today it’s almost inconceivable that a local would buy a flat here, but there’s still a regular turnover of immigrants attracted by the dirt-cheap property and the presence of so many compatriots. It’s a place of strange speculation: when things are this cheap, both the poor and those who exploit them see an opportunity. A flat now costs only €6,000, and if you buy-to-let without worrying about paying for repairs or safety equipment, your investment could be paid off in 18 months. And for as long as everything is in private hands, the state is unwilling or unable to intervene.Elisabetta Micciarelli is the headmistress of a primary school in Ancona, 30km north of Porto Recanati. She’s in her 50s, lithe and grey-haired, energetic and idealistic. “Integration”, she says, “occurs because of the host, not the guest. If your child has a birthday party and you don’t invite the foreign child in his class, it’s not going to happen.”Silvia Mainardi, one of the teachers, points out various students. “That lad,” she says, pointing out a cheery seven-year-old running around the corridors, “was found wandering alone along the Greek-Albanian border. He was adopted by an Italian family. That boy arrived here from Libya on a dinghy with his father.”There are so many immigrant children in the school that it has deliberately become a holistic place of healing and recreation. Micciarelli and her staff work almost as much with the families as with their children, and the school has a psychologist available to parents. “We’re often the only place where they are listened to,” Micciarelli says. The school has founded a charity, Si Può Fare (“We can do it”) and runs courses for mothers, as well as free after-school courses in music, theatre, sports and even sailing for the poorest children.Every few weeks a new student arrives, usually frightened and traumatised, not speaking Italian, often not even knowing its alphabet. In 2005, four siblings, the Mossamets, joined the school. Asik, Cameyi, Sajid and Jsan were from Bangladesh, and had come with their mother to be with their father, Ibrahim, who had been working in a factory in Camerano, just south of Ancona, for years. Only the oldest child had stayed in Bangladesh.Their difficulties were huge. The mother was illiterate, and Sajid was deaf-mute, and had never had any education. Their father seemed to have fallen out with the local Bangladeshi community, some said because he had been drinking too much. Even by immigrant standards, they were isolated and facing immense challenges.But Cameyi, who was 10, was bright and vivacious. Because she was put in a class of younger children, she was looked up to by her peers. She was like most girls her age: singing pop songs, window-shopping, going for a passeggiata – a stroll – along the city’s boulevards. Her Italian quickly improved, and she was soon like a second mother in the family, translating for everyone.To say the school went the extra mile is an understatement. Mainardi used her knowledge of sign language to communicate with Sajid and translate the Qur’an for him. She often invited the siblings to dinner in order, as she says, to “raise them out of poverty”. Mainardi took Cameyi and her siblings to doctors’ appointments. They regularly stayed overnight in her flat, squeezing in with her own children.The family had been in Italy for five years when things started to go wrong. Cameyi’s father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He lost his job, and by late 2009 had fallen behind on rent payments. One day Cameyi was asked into the headmistress’s office after school. There were two social workers there, who said she couldn’t go home. Her family’s flat had been repossessed. All her clothes and makeup, her trinkets and teddy bears were gone.Social services had arranged a room for Cameyi, her mother and for her two younger siblings, in a grotty hotel near the station. Her older brother Asik and her father – who was undergoing chemotherapy that day and, according to the teachers, “vomiting every three paces” – would be left on the streets.Again the teachers pulled out all the stops. For a month and half they raised enough money to pay for a hotel room so that Ibrahim and Asik could be with their family. “I even told my father’s car mechanic that I needed €50,” Mainardi laughs, “and he just opened his till and took it. People were incredibly generous.”Mainardi showed me a photo of the new flat that social services eventually found for the family. The walls are so grey and black with mould, but Cameyi is on the sofa, smiling. By then she was 15 and bored with school. The headmistress says that Cameyi seemed to have pulsioni, a word that implies both “instincts” and “sex drive”.“I had the idea that she was older than her age,” she remembers. “She had a longing for love, she was in love with love. She was putting on makeup, hoping to be on show, longing to redeem herself.”Cameyi was also finding her family claustrophobic. She told the teachers she wanted to come to all the after-school courses, but that she wasn’t allowed. “I went to pick her up for school one day”, recalls Mainardi, “and she was sitting there with her two younger siblings looking extremely grumpy.” Like most teenagers, Cameyi must have often resented her relatives, feeling ashamed or embarrassed by people who seemed to her disabled, illiterate, ill and unemployed.Then, early one morning in May 2010, says Micciarelli, a desperate Ibrahim came into her office and said that Cameyi hadn’t been home all night. Micciarelli accompanied him to the police station and reported the young girl missing.Micciarelli and Mainardi went through Cameyi’s schoolbooks and found a diary. In it were all sorts of love hearts and ti amo (“I love you”) scrawlings. The name written in the teenager’s diary, the seeming object of her infatuation, was Monir Kazi.The investigation picked up speed. Some claimed to have seen Cameyi at the railway station catching a train south towards Porto Recanati. Kazi was 20, five years older than her, and lived in an eighth-floor flat at Hotel House with four others. He had met Cameyi in Ancona, where his sister lived. A photograph of the two kissing had been shared on Myspace.When police went through Hotel House’s CCTV (which has since stopped working), Cameyi was seen entering alone. “She didn’t have the maturity to recognise the danger of a building that would repel you or me,” says Mainardi. “Her problem was her innocence, not her so-called emancipation.”Investigators obtained a search warrant for Kazi’s flat. His pillow had blood on it, but when tested it didn’t show a match for Cameyi’s. Kazi had gone to hospital for hours on the day she went missing, complaining of stomach cramps. Even more suspicious was his decision suddenly to up sticks: he left Italy to go to Greece. In July of that year, Cameyi’s father died.Police couldn’t begin extradition proceedings without evidence, and they had none. Kazi eventually returned to Italy but, in 2011, was expelled from the country. The investigation into the missing 15-year-old petered out, and many people felt there was a lack of urgency because the missing person lacked well-connected Italian relatives. “Over the years,” says Silvia Mainardi, “no one spoke about this case in the city: there were no processions, appeals, nothing to move public opinion.”When you ask Micciarelli, the headmistress, how Ancona has changed after 30 years of immigration, she says something unexpected: “It hasn’t changed at all. There are just two Anconas now, because all the foreigners are concentrated in certain areas.”Mainardi remained close to Cameyi’s family, who were convinced Cameyi had left home for a better life. Mainardi even became so fascinated by the idealism and dysfunctionality of the immigration system – “something had so clearly gone wrong here” – that she became an external student of the subject at Bologna University.At the end of June this year, three months after the femur was found, confirmation arrived that the human remains from the drug dealer’s abandoned building were those of Cameyi. It was, by then, over eight years since her disappearance. Investigators always talk about speed and momentum, but a few years, in the chaotic life of Hotel House, is like a century. All trace of Kazi is gone, and investigators admit they don’t know where he is.“I always had the sense that everything led to Hotel House,” says Mainardi. But this new proof was “a chilling change of perspective”. She is a cheerful woman by habit, but is angered by the lack of dignity afforded to Cameyi even in death: “That ditch was a general dumping ground for rubbish. That’s what really hurts.”At Hotel House, residents are weary of all the bad press because, they say, outsiders don’t see what really goes on. Most of the fights aren’t examples of gang warfare but just arguments between cricketers from Asia and footballers from Africa about who can play on the makeshift concrete pitch. Punch-ups that have been written up as drug dealers’ turf wars, they’ll tell you, were really over a bike or a woman – just as happens everywhere when men have drunk too much.And it’s true that the longer you’re there, the serenity emerges as much as the darkness. The building has been a marginalised community for so long that there are now second-generation “hotel-dwellers”: 404 minors live in the building. They make the place noisy and playful. As I watched a game of five-a-side with Franca, she named them all and their nationalities: Macedonian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Algerian … but they were all screaming at each other in slangy Italian. Without even thinking about it, they are linguistic natives.One of the most interesting aspects of the building is the hopefulness of the Italian residents. They represent about half a percent of Hotel House’s population. They have long given up on the idea of getting back what their flats were once worth – but that, you sense, isn’t the only reason they haven’t moved out.Luca Davide, the porter, told me why he stays on: “Here there’s goodness, and we’ve got to help it emerge, to make the world understand that 30 ethnicities can coexist peacefully.” Although realistic about the building’s problems, Davide is fond of the ethnic ersity. “We could become a beacon of integration. We could have people envy what we’ve created.” The struggles of his neighbours, he says, are his own: “Our interests are complementary, they overlap.”On the 11th floor there’s a retired air force colonel, Alfredo La Rosa, who was born in Libya. The place reminds him of housing estates where he grew up, where people survived with barely anything. “Hotel House”, he told Internazionale magazine recently, “speaks of our future, of the multiethnic society that is coming. This building could be a great opportunity to experiment with forms of coexistence.”Another draw for the remaining Italians is that they, knowing how to make things happen, can improve peoples’ lives very simply. Franca got the mayor to turn a couple of streetlamps around to act as floodlights for the one grass pitch. Enzo bought the chalk for the lines. Franca goes and knocks on doors until 200 people have stumped up €40 each to repair and replace the sewers.When those Italians talk about integration, they sound plaintive, not xenophobic. “For true integration,” Enzo the glass-blower says, “you have to understand how things work here, you have to be able to adapt in order not to be marginalised.” You get the sense that the Italians now see themselves as a tiny, often ignored, minority.Every time you go there, you’re also struck by the variety: a Tunisian teenager in a catalogue-clean flat studying fashion, hoping to get to the Accademia in Milan an Italian doctor who holds a surgery on the eighth floor the Pakistani cricketer who hopes to play for the Italian national team. There’s both integration and isolation. The most isolated, you sense, are the wives who you only see once a week when they catch the Thursday bus to market.Nobody denies Hotel House’s problems. Police know that drug users are still coming from 400km away to score wholesale. But the business is still tiny compared to, say, Naples, Rome or Milan. National law enforcement agencies have bigger fish to fry than Hotel House. And so it lingers on, in its uniquely extra-statal, self-regulating way.Every initiative seems to bounce off it. The mayor of Porto Recanati ordered its complete evacuation by December last year if safety measures were not put in place, but that deadline passed and people stayed. The regional government has lent the building’s administrator €100,000 to renovate the external areas and begin safety work, but the loan has irritated law-abiding locals who say it’s a state bailout that rewards illegality. The doomsday scenario – in which a fire engulfs the whole building – seems worryingly imaginable.And yet it is a home to thousands. There are 30 legitimate businesses. Qui sto bene, almost everyone says: “I’m good here.” Many say benissimo. One Senegalese man says to me in thumpy Italian: “It’s not so different to Senegal: the beach, the rubbish, the struggle.” Every time you go, you meet someone new, but often, when you ask after someone you met last time, you’re told they’ve moved on. There’s little permanence in migrancy.Given that the police don’t even know precisely who is living at Hotel House, it seems far-fetched that they’ll ever find someone who left here seven years ago. Nobody knows where Monir Kazi is.

Ahead of talks with his opposite number in Paris, Hunt accused Brussels of waiting for Britain “to blink” in negotiations as he claimed the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal were “increasing by the day”.“That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,” he said. “There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.”In an interview before his trip to France, Hunt told the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that his approach to the talks would inflict a “breakdown in relations and trust” between Britain and the continent, which would be a “profound geostrategic mistake”.“The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European commission, who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink,” he told the Evening Standard. “France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel, because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”However, Brussels insiders have repeatedly said Barnier and his negotiating team are only acting on the orders of France, Germany and the rest of the 27 EU countries. Any inflexibility originates from the nation states.Hunt warned that a no-deal Brexit would be an economic “tragedy” for Britain and Europe. “If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial,” he said, alluding to the flow of money from the City of London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f36b61fcb98fc3e779b0cd7bee0d9d230ce761/0_36_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56d36b46562687f616c1a3d875dc6e7f","title":"m20 lorry park no deal brexit dover council","story":"Impact assessment by Dover council says urgent clarity is needed from the government A “temporary solution” to managing cross-Channel traffic in the event of a no-deal Brexit risks turning much of the M20 into a giant lorry park for many years, a report says.The impact assessment by Dover district council, released under freedom of information, expresses concern over the levels of readiness for the potential situation and states that urgent clarity is needed from the government.It says: “A 13-mile stretch of the coastbound section of the M20, between junction 8 near Maidstone and junction 9 near Ashford, will be earmarked to hold heavy goods vehicles, in what will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park holding around 2,000 lorries.“It is likely that a permanent solution will not be in place for many years if enacted through current planning processes and procedures. It will also depend on the post-Brexit customs arrangements reached with the European Union. Therefore, the ‘temporary’ traffic-management system Operation Brock will be in force for some time.”The document expresses concern at the slow pace of work on Operation Brock, and states “there does not appear to be a plan B”.The report says: “The freight vehicles currently only take seconds to clear the port of Dover but if Brexit ends up creating regulatory and tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, it is predicted that there could be gridlock around the town and through to Maidstone and beyond.“If increased waiting times persisted then perishable goods could be damaged and supply chains interrupted. There is also a potential impact on air quality of any increased traffic queues at border controls.“Customs checks on imports from outside the common market can take between five minutes to 45 minutes per vehicle. Port officials have warned that increasing the average time it takes to clear customs by as little as two minutes could lead to 17-mile traffic jams.”The council, which acts as the health authority responsible for food safety checks at Dover and the Channel tunnel, also raised concerns about its powers.The document asks whether the government fully understands that the port health authority “has powers to examine and detain food, but not to physically stop vehicles in the first place”.It adds that officials are “in the large ... blind as to what is entering the port”.The layout of the port is open with no physical boundaries, which means there is nothing to stop vehicles leaving, and the health authority has “inadequate facilities at the port to inspect food or appropriately store food”.The document states: “We ask that the government fully engages with us to ensure that the food safety function is fully understood and any proposed controls are outlined ... to ensure that they are relevant, workable and logistically feasible bearing in mind the current status.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392bc39edec87d0eeed0184a4ae11236634d592f/95_221_3330_1998/master/3330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b992e08b771bd467522054a03848cff6","title":"england trust adil rashid india test series","story":"The five Test series against India condensed into little more than six weeks will determine whether this is an annus horribilis or mirabilis for England. The drawn Test series against Pakistan was a disappointment although it was countered by ODI victories against Australia and India. But this is what will define England’s summer.Both captains have their issues though it was hard to establish that as they trod a stately path through their obligatory press conferences on the eve of the match. Virat Kohli leads the No 1 ranked team in the world but he is forever asked about his (very modest) record in England and the disparity between his side’s home and away record, which is substantial.The focus on Kohli’s previous output here and his struggles against Jimmy Anderson must be manna from heaven for all his other batsmen. On Tuesday he was serene, soft-spoken and mellow, when answering questions exclusively from Indian journalists. He spoke in generalities and his words were received as if he were a very senior politician or a minor deity.The problem for Joe Root is that England have won only one of their past nine Test matches, the last one they played at Leeds. He naturally tends to regard that victory as the platform of a revival. This series will test the validity of that theory. We were assured that both sides were “in a good place”.In reality the selection processes of both sides may indicate their state of mind just as clearly. England announced their side 22 hours before the start of the match which suggests a forthright, uncompromising attitude, though this is not necessarily confirmed by the names selected. At Edgbaston there was the opportunity to allow Root a wide variety of options, four pacemen and two spinners even before the captain considered himself (Root, remember, managed to polish off Lancashire’s lower order in the Roses match with remarkable speed last week – Adil Rashid could not have done it any quicker).The surface at Edgbaston had changed hue by Tuesday. The pitch itself now has very little green grass visible it looks brown, dry and reasonably hard unlike the outfield, which is verdant green, a source of angst, one surmises, to water boards and reverse swingers. With a weather forecast that predicts more sunshine and high temperatures, there is a good chance that spinners will have an impact on the game.When explaining his chosen side Root said: “This team gives us great balance. It gives us a huge number of options. I feel it gives us the best chance of taking 20 wickets. That’s the thinking. It gives us great variety, different angles, different spin options and some world-class performers with the ball.”Well, that sounds reassuring. The bold approach would have the pacemen doing most of the damage in the first innings with the spinners having an impact in the second. But to have the maximum number of options with the ball in this side Dawid Malan would have been replaced by Moeen Ali.But Moeen, who has a fine Test record at the ground where he started his professional career, has been omitted and Rashid is the solitary specialist spinner (with due deference to Root). This means that there are just two changes from the side that beat Pakistan in Leeds.Maybe they were uncomfortable about making more changes than that after such an overwhelming victory. If confidence really was high there was surely a strong case for playing Moeen. It is not obvious how much this weakens England’s batting lineup.Admittedly Moeen has not scored many runs this summer – neither has Malan – but in his last Test against India he did score 190 runs in the match at Chennai in December 2016. One never quite knows what Moeen is going to do, which remains one of his charms. Without Malan, Moeen would have been a candidate to bat at four so would Ben Stokes, who seems to have swayed towards becoming an old-fashioned blocker since his return. Or England could have drawn straws to establish the order from four to seven, which may not go down so well in the scientific 21st century.The absence of Moeen makes Rashid’s role trickier. He has never played a Test in England he has never been the solitary specialist spinner in the side. And he has never started in a Test match with the words “He’s a spoilt brat” from Geoffrey Boycott ringing in his ears.Moeen has been Rashid’s mentor in recent times and it might have been helpful to have him in the side to help carry the spinning burden. Now Root has to bowl Rashid in the first innings, whether he likes it or not that situation would have been eased with Moeen’s presence. This selection makes life more difficult for the returning leg-spinner.Kohli was far less forthcoming about his side. In the recent past India have tended to play just one spinner in England and they could do the same on Wednesday with Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma supported by the all-rounder Hardik Pandya.The unusually talented Kuldeep Yadav, the left-arm wrist-spinner, was included in the squad but it would be a surprise if he played. England have seven left-handers in their team, most of whom were neutered by the off-spinner Nathan Lyon in Australia, so Ravi Ashwin will surely play. Ravindra Jadeja skittled Afghanistan in his last Test and he knows how to bat. Two spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja, would seem to be a good idea for the tourists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea3d8a51ccf1b7267a1bec779917733ab81582b/45_13_5040_3025/master/5040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce0c53963a6b1ab737d717804775756","title":"john gosden stradivarius dark vision","story":"John Gosden spoke up in favour of staying horses after the Goodwood Cup here on Tuesday and, thanks to the success of his magnificent chestnut Straarius in the day’s feature race, he will not argue an easier case all season. For a moment, just over a furlong from home, the front-running Torcedor seemed to have the Ascot Gold Cup winner in trouble, but Straarius rose to the challenge to chase him down and win by half a length, keeping alive his chance to win a £1m bonus at York next month in the process.Torcedor is likely to line up against Straarius once again in the Lonsdale Cup at York, the last leg of a four-timer that began in the Yorkshire Cup at the same track in early May. With Straarius set to carry a 3lb penalty on the Knavesmire, Tuesday’s form suggests that there will be even less to choose between the two horses on 24 August, and Straarius may need to improve once again to secure the seven-figure bonus.The sight of Straarius and Torcedor going head-to-head in the sunshine at the end of a fierce two-mile gallop around the top of the Sussex downs was a memorable way to start Goodwood’s most famous fixture. Andrea Atzeni, who rode Straarius to victory in the same race last year, was back in his saddle as Frankie Dettori sat out the penultimate day of a costly suspension, and judged his challenge to perfection as Colm O’Donoghue tried to run the finish out of him.“ I’m terrified of racing becoming one-dimensional and while I love sprinters, you don’t want to watch eight sprints a day. You need these long races. The commercial world needs a certain amount of precocity and speed, but I think it’s gone too far that way, and the ownerbreeder that produces horses like this is now a rare species. We’re trying to bring that back.”Given the 3lb turnaround in the Lonsdale, it is a slight surprise to find Paddy Power offering 6-1 about Torcedor for the rematch next month. Straarius, meanwhile, is a 1-2 chance with the same firm.Dark Vision was added to the betting for next year’s 2,000 Guineas after what was ultimately a comfortable win in the Group Two Vintage Stakes, but the bare form of the race offers no hint of the problems that the colt and his jockey, Silvestre de Sousa, needed to overcome on their trip around the Downs.Even Mark Johnston, Dark Vision’s trainer, had abandoned hope after a furlong, when Dark Vision trailed the field after missing the break. A slow start is often a fatal mistake at this sharp, twisting track and the 100-30 favourite traded at nearly 20-1 in running, but De Sousa saved ground where he could and then patiently worked his way into contention in the straight before storming past Dunkerron and Confiding with a furlong to run.“When he missed the break, I thought it was all over,” Johnston said. “At that stage, if he’d come fourth I’d have thought that I’ve got a really nice horse on my hands and I’ve just got to cure his start problem. I never thought until a furlong out that he had any chance of winning. The biggest trouble now will be keeping everyone’s feet on the ground.”Dark Vision’s win was the eighth already this year for his 19-strong ownership syndicate, each of whom paid £7,000 for a share in three colts that the trainer “had left on the shelf unsold”. He can be backed at around 25-1 for next year’s Guineas and Johnston can expect to field some big-money offers for his colt in the weeks ahead.Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a92f9bf5ea2d094a277e2ce39f66edad147eed5/0_36_2107_1264/master/2107.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2869da8ffb7a3b294989247dd8b19f33","title":"jos buttler england test vice captain","story":"At the start of the summer Jos Buttler was plying his trade in the Indian Premier League and one of England’s most gifted batsmen appeared to be locked into the gilded cage of white-ball specialism despite still harbouring hopes of a Test return.But with the national selector, Ed Smith, granting this wish for the two-match series against Pakistan, in a bold move that eschewed the conventional cricketing logic of needing strong county returns, Buttler now finds himself just an injury to Joe Root away from leading the side after he was named the new vice-captain for the visit of India.Jimmy Anderson steps down from the role he has held since the arrest of Ben Stokes in Bristol last September and in his place comes a batsman who plays as a specialist No 7 and is still to register his maiden Test century from 20 stop-start caps to date on paper it appears a remarkable show of faith from the team management.And yet with Buttler having long been the consigliere to Eoin Morgan in England’s soaraway one-day side – even leading them to an impressive 2-1 win in Bangladesh when the captain opted out on security grounds – Root is now keen to cash in not only on the 27-year-old’s ability to take down bowling attacks but his cricketing brain too.“It might be a slightly bold statement but I see it as a great opportunity and it gives us a different way of looking at things, maybe grabbing a few things from the one-day side not trying to replicate it but obviously they’ve had huge amounts of success and it would be wrong not to tap into that.”Root, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s series opener at Edgbaston, was also keen to stress that the move was no reflection on the job Anderson has done, nor a case of paving the way for him to be phased out of the side despite having this week turned 36 and with a shoulder injury currently being managed.Indeed Root tipped England’s record wicket-taker to be a “massive part” of the team for “the next few years”. It is becoming apparent, however, that Anderson, Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad are viewed as senior players but not the central core of the Test dressing room, with Root, Stokes, Buttler and Jonny Bairstow now the main pillars instead.Root, whose 18-month tenure in charge of the Test team has faltered somewhat after two home wins against South Africa and West Indies last summer, added: “It’s a chance for us to grab a core group of players who are playing across all formats to really drive this team in a strong direction and a better direction than we have been going.”Buttler was tipped as Test captaincy material by Smith back in 2017, when the national selector was a newspaper columnist. But his promotion for this series alone, rather than indefinitely, perhaps points to both his ongoing bid to cement a spot permanently and the fact that Stokes may yet be considered for a return to the role depending on the outcome of next week’s court case in Bristol (he has pleaded not guilty to a charge of affray).Root conceded as much upon naming his new deputy – “that’s a decision for after this series and a decision that’s made over my head” – but for now his second-in-command is a player with the Midas touch this summer, averaging 67 across all formats, and one whose softly-spoken demeanour masks an impressively ruthless approach to the sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0496f07539918a3cdf4fdf1f8e9ad69fec85d03/0_58_5184_3113/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0514f1acaa61f1b85762a5f89201e4d","title":"kareem open letter nfl owners","story":"To deny professional athletes the right to express dissent in a peaceful manner is a disgrace to the Constitution, the opposite of patriotism and shameful moral weaknessWhew! What a tumultuous year for your league. Slipping attendance and ratings. Continuing concussion controversy. Lawsuits from cheerleaders who refuse to shut up and smile. Domestic violence accusations against players. The Papa John’s founder mouthing off about something or other. Players taking a national anthem knee (NAK, for short). President Trump’s “problematic” rambling. Commissioner Roger Goodell under siege from, well, everybody. Bet it makes you fellas long for the good old days when all you had to worry about was Janet Jackson’s nip slip. Where’s faithful Hodor when you need someone to hold the door against relentless attackers?Then you made it worse.In May, you implemented a childish policy about how grown men must respond to the national anthem: a player can stay in the locker room during the anthem, but if he takes the field and then protests, the team and the player can be fined. Oh, Dear Owners. You stood at the precipice of history tasked with deciding whether to choose the principles of the US Constitution over profits of commerce, patriotism over pandering, morality over mob mentality, promoting social justice over pushing beers. Sadly, you blinked. Courage, it seems, is expected only of players.Now, following the Miami Dolphins channeling of the abusive students in Stanford Prison Experiment by over-punishing protesting players, the May agreement is frozen and new negotiations have begun, this time including the NFL Players Association. A kneejerk reaction came on 26 July when Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced he would require all players to stand during the anthem – or else. President Trump was not too busy with his tariff wars to claim a personal victory: “Way to go Jerry. This is what the league should do!” (Too busy to put in that comma after “go,” though.)Why aren’t you NFL owners outraged by that? If it were white people suffering those same statistics, you wouldn’t even play the national anthem. Then again, you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to become owners in the first place.To be fair, not all you owners have cowered under the false flag of patriotism to hide their shame. New York Jets chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson said the team would not discipline a player who protests and he would pay the league’s fine. Giants co-owner Steve Tisch has also said that his players will not be punished for protesting during the anthem. Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, released a statement vaguely supporting his players right to “influence positive change”, Jed York, the CEO of the 49ers and the sole abstainee from the May vote, has not elaborated on the club’s policy. I’m sure your players appreciate your loyalty to them. The rest of us respect your integrity in the face of political pressure. And there is the $90m the NFL has earmarked for social justice causes over the next seven years.We all are entitled to our opinions, but when those opinions translate into actions that affect the whole community at large, we have a responsibility to scrutinize those opinions, to hold them to a higher standard of reason. Denying your players their freedom to express their concerns sends a clear message that you don’t value your black players’ values. You’re telling them that they must abide by your white perception of social justice even though you have no experience with the kind of institutional injustice that robs their community of lives, hope and a future. You are owners in that you own the franchise, but you don’t own the players or their hearts and minds. I’m reminded of the song from protest singer Phil Ochs, “I’m Gonna Say It Now”:Ooh, you’d like to be my father you’d like to be my dad,And give me kisses when I’m good and k me when I’m bad.But since I’ve left my parents I’ve forgotten how to bow,So when I’ve got something to say, sir, I’m gonna say it now.If not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b3dfcb32956f2a2a6b8a2f3223f9867b4258de/226_328_4799_2879/master/4799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9f1ce975de5513f1697d42cbc09a55","title":"lizzy yarnold i wanted to scream winter olympic double gold medallist","story":"Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian spent four months on medication due to an ongoing back condition but she is hopeful a spinal operation will enable her to finally enjoy her successLizzy Yarnold avoids lingering in her sitting room because of the bad memories it stirs. She lives in a cottage 10 miles inland from Portsmouth, thoughtfully decorated, including intricate Lego models of Tower Bridge and The Simpsons’ house, constructed with husband James, and a small vegetable patch in the back garden. It is an idyllic setting but in the four months since winning a second Olympic skeleton gold it has been the scene of an agonising daily battle.“I try not to go in that room too much because there is a grey sofa in there which I spent weeks just lying on and crying,” she says. “In the morning I’d take an industrial amount of painkillers and lay there waiting for them to take effect.”It is only now that Yarnold, 29, feels comfortable enough to talk in detail about the chronic back pain which meant she underwent spinal surgery in June and has still not been able to properly celebrate becoming Great Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian. “I know this is a conversation I need to have,” she says, “to try and show the truth behind the smiles and everything you might see on social media. There’s the price of having been successful.“At the moment I can see this gold medal but I can’t pick up the letters that drop through the letterbox. I’m hoping over time when I recognise the impact of the gold medal, through going to schools and talking to kids, that it will feel like it was worth it.”Yarnold had been hoping to avoid surgery and is glassy eyed when recounting the moment she realised there was no realistic alternative. “The doctor said: ‘You can’t stay on this amount of medication.’ As an athlete that’s hard to hear but I had to face up to that. They cut a hole in my spine and chipped out bits. On the notes it says “harvesting loose fragments from Lizzy’s spine”.Yarnold started her career as a track and field athlete, specialising in heptathlon. Even before switching to skeleton a decade ago, she had a bad back. But she is also aware that hurtling down an icy track at 80mph an estimated 1,500 times, in training and competition, will not have helped. “Yes, my back is going to be worse in 10 or 20 years because I’ve been an athlete but I wouldn’t have ever chosen a life without sport so it wasn’t a sliding doors thing. In 2012 I had a back seizure in a gym in Calgary and couldn’t move for hours.“The muscles on either side of the spinal column seize up and it’s intense pain. At the world championships in Königsee in Germany in 2017 we were packing up afterwards and I was crawling on the floor in the bathroom to get the shower gel, crawling over to my bag to put it in, and I didn’t really think anything of it because I’ve always had a bad back.”At the Sochi Olympics in 2014, Yarnold won gold to justify her position as favourite having dominated the season, but four years later in South Korea it was a different story. She had taken a year out after Russia and had mixed fortunes after returning.What her fellow competitors did not know is that six months before Pyeongchang, she had also discovered a growth in a knee. Yarnold was warned the tumour could be cancerous but only a biopsy would be able to determine the cause of the problem and the medical team said the risk was low. She opted to continue on to the Games without having surgery.Further obstacles were thrown up on arrival in Pyeongchang. First, there was the onset of a chest infection. “We were staying on the seventh floor of the hotel and had Belgium and New Zealand above us and only one lift. If I was coming out at the seventh floor I could see the other nations thinking: ‘Why can’t you just walk up the stairs?’ They weren’t heated so there was ice on the windows. I started walking up and down everyday and the pain in my chest worsened to the point I was unable to speak. The first day of competition I was in the warm-up bit on the bike coughing up sweet-corn-sized bits of phlegm and struggling to breathe. The doctor listened to my chest and said: ‘You’re really ill, you’ve got a really bad chest infection but there’s nothing I can do for you now.’”On the first day of competition she also suffered a flare-up of a vestibular disorder which makes her dizzy and disorientated. “After my first run I went to the bathroom, took off my suit and couldn’t see anything,” she says. “I said to Louise Turner, the physiotherapist: ‘If I go again is it going to kill me?’ It sounds dramatic but it felt extreme, like life and death. I don’t know if I’m going to lose orientation within the first few corners and then you’re just going to be a rag doll at 80mph. She assured me there would be doctors at the bottom of the track who knew what was going on.”Yarnold managed to maintain third position overnight and her condition improved the next day she created history by becoming the first Briton to successfully defend a Winter Olympic title. She overhauled Janine Flock of Austria on the fourth and final run, while her British team-mate and close friend Laura Deas claimed bronze.She had been looking forward to lengthy celebrations but just weeks later underwent a knee operation. Being on crutches seemed to worsen her back pain and she was diagnosed with two displaced discs.“I went to friends’ houses and I’d be able to sit and have dinner for five or 10 minutes and then I’d have to go to lie down in their lounge in my one no-pain position,” she says. “When I got the honour of the OBE, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association office sent me this amazing bunch of flowers and I had to go and collect them. I was so angry because I was thinking, ‘I don’t want flowers, I want to be able to go to the toilet without having pain.’ It made it really difficult that people were saying well done, without knowing what I was going through.“I wanted to scream: ‘I wish you knew the truth.’”Yarnold did not get into sport to be a role model but it is a responsibility she takes very seriously. She is also outspoken about the need for mental health to be of paramount importance in athletes. “I’m seeing someone for support. If everyone could see a therapist that would be an amazing thing. The hardest thing is admitting you are struggling.“I haven’t been able to drive so I’ve been getting the train to school appearances. Because I can’t sit up I would have to lie across two train seats with my feet dangling off the end. Someone even tweeted me saying: ‘I thought it was you and wanted to say hi but you really didn’t look like yourself.’ I felt very guilty that I wasn’t the athlete that they wanted me to be.”Because of the cocktail of powerful painkillers Yarnold has been taking for the past four months, her memory is fuzzy and she cannot yet contemplate returning to competition. What she really wants is to be healthy and enjoy the fact she had made history.At the side of Yarnold’s fridge are several unopened bottles of champagne. She bought a case from a vineyard in New Zealand and gave a bottle to each of her coaches. “Because I can’t drink alcohol on this medication it’s all just sat there,” she says. “It’s a simple thing but I’m a Guinness person and I could really do with a pint of Guinness right now.”Hopefully she will be able to properly toast her successes soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460a4903ad9c3641fb347be7b50a3bcf5db576fe/0_19_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889b4e9d3baa6fdc9761c6135bcfd414","title":"sophie bray lily owsley england hockey world cup","story":"The phoney war is finally over and now England face a potentially tournament-defining night against the most dangerous of foes. They overcame the banana skin of South Korea in this crossover match for a last-eight place, winning via goals from Sophie Bray and Lily Owsley at either end of the match it means hot favourites the Netherlands, free-scoring so far, lie in wait for Danny Kerry’s side on Thursday.After a series of profligate group stage performances, England knew a fast start would aid their cause against opponents who had already conceded seven times to the Dutch. They came out flying and Alex Danson had already threatened when Bray struck in the ninth minute.It took her two attempts to beat Hwang Hyeon-a after superb work from Sarah Haycroft and the celebrations were put on hold as Korea sought recourse to the video umpire. Their appeal, for a possible foul by Haycroft, failed and England had the platform they wanted.That was the cue for England to assume near-total control and chances to increase their lead followed. Bray, Susannah Townsend and Danson – twice – all came close to a second, while there had been next to no threat from their opponents before half-time. By then, the shot count stood at 9-0 in England’s favour.They were almost punished midway through the third quarter when Cheon Seul-ki forced an alert save from Maddie Hinch. It was tighter, tenser fare now, the Koreans more assertive and England more frayed. Danson came close to a breakaway goal but as the minutes ticked down the home side were increasingly under the cosh.In a frantic finale Hinch saved brilliantly from An\u0026nbspHyo-ju and then, 60 seconds later, Owsley made the game safe. Her second goal of the tournament came with South Korea stranded upfield and she had the relatively simple task of rolling the ball into the open net from an angle.“I really enjoyed the first half,” Kerry told the BBC afterwards. “We absolutely smashed it. In the second half, we lost some shape up front, but the first half was fantastic.“I knew the second half would be cagey as fatigue set in, but I’m a pretty proud coach. We have a few things up our sleeve for the Dutch.”England’s quarter-final will start at 6pm on Thursday. Immediately after it Ireland, one of the World Cup’s early success stories, will battle India for the last of the semi-final slots. India defeated Italy 3-0 earlier on Tuesday, Lalremsiami scoring early on before Neha Goyal and Vandana Katariya added goals in the second period.Wednesday’s last-eight ties see Germany take on Spain in a rematch of their final Pool C fixture before Argentina, who have stuttered up to this point, face Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82039a9af50127483dd558d122d94df333c155c1/0_93_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30fa08fb225dc41ac7e6914ca705bf48","title":"facebook russia election midterms meddling","story":"Company reports ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ as it deletes 32 political pages and accountsFacebook has detected “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” before the United States midterm elections that could be linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian-based group with ties to the Kremlin.On Tuesday, the social network removed 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram that were pushing American political stances and organising events, including a protest against a Unite the Right rally due to take place in Washington next week.“It’s clear whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their identities than the Internet Research Agency did in the run up to the 2016 presidential election,” said Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, in a call with reporters.In October 2017, the social network admitted that Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans during the 2016 presidential election. Those accounts sometimes used Russian IP addresses and paid for advertising in roubles. The people behind the accounts removed on Tuesday, which had a total of 290,000 followers, used virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their locations and internet phone services to hide their identities. They paid third parties to spend approximately $11,000 (in US and Canadian dollars) for about 150 ads on Facebook and Instagram.“At this point we don’t have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind this, but they have shown similar activity and have connected with known IRA accounts,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.In one case, a known IRA account was a co-admin on one of the pages for seven minutes before the account was removed from Facebook. “We think that is interesting but not determinative,” said Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer. Stamos said it was not clear whether this was the “IRA with improved capabilities or a separate group”.Stamos said intelligence agencies were in a better position to make an attribution by combining the technical details from Facebook with their own knowledge of the political motivations and goals of countries and other threat actors.“If they want to make an attribution decision, it’s up to them,” he said.In spite of Facebook’s caution over attribution, members of Congress who had been briefed by the company this week were quick to ascribe blame to Russia.“Today’s disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow ision and spread disinformation, and I am glad that Facebook is taking some steps to pinpoint and address this activity,” said Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat.Some of the deleted pages include “Aztlan Warriors”, “Resisters” and “Black Elevation”. The “Resisters” page created a Facebook event for a protest on 10-12 August titled “No Unite The Right 2”. Admins for the page connected with the admins of five legitimate pages to promote the event and post logistical information for protesters. About 600 users said they would attend the event and 2,600 expressed an interest in attending.“We disabled the event earlier today and reached out out to the legitimate admins of five other pages,” said Gleicher. Facebook also pledged to inform the people considering attending the protest about what happened. There was also coordinated activity around #AbolishICE, a leftwing campaign aimed at shutting down the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the New York Times reported. The activity appears to echo the Kremlin’s creation and promotion of black activism pages such as “Blacktivist” in the run-up to the presidential election.Facebook revealed that the bad actors had created 30 Facebook events since May 2017, most of which had been scheduled over the past year. The company said it did not know if people had showed up to those events.Facebook said it would continue to investigate the activity and share any further findings with law enforcement and Congress. “Security isn’t a problem you ever completely solve,” said the company’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, in a Facebook post. “We face sophisticated and well-funded adversaries, including nation states, that are always evolving and trying new attacks.”The cybersecurity researcher Lukasz Olejnik said: “Artificially inducing civil unrests or protests via internet platforms is a worrying development, and incorporation of Instagram is quite novel.”He added: “This development touching Washington indicates that concerns about European parliament 2019 elections might now be viewed in rather intriguing light.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1221a000d94e24d8f325ace38dd0edc63f511116/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f89819a8fbe8f735dd4cfecddae9c0","title":"the traditional cash only bakery thats making dough after accepting cards","story":" It took Plum Duff bakery 45 years to embrace modern payments systems, but owner Ian Moore now reckons it’s a piece of cakeFor business owners who have relied for years on traditional ways of working, the prospect of embracing change and getting to grips with new technology can seem daunting. In reality, many new solutions are easy to incorporate and can transform the way businesses work, opening up a range of exciting opportunities.Plum Duff is run by chef Ian Moore, who has worked in some of the world’s top kitchens, such as London’s Dorchester hotel. He joined in 1989, becoming the bakery’s owner in 2004 and maintaining it as one of the last local shops in west London to bake everything on-site. Steeped in history, the patisserie is famous for its fresh breads, cakes, and pastries.The bakers was successful, but Moore became increasingly aware of the need to introduce modern payment technology. “Plum Duff had been a cash-only business since it opened its doors 45 years ago,” he says. “After serving customers who paid cash for so long, I was a little bit wary about taking card payments, but I also realised that Plum Duff needed to join the 21st century.”He discovered Square and its mobile-based point-of-sale (POS) system that allows anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments, anywhere, at any time. In January he took the plunge and signed up, and now uses the mobile-connected Square Reader to take credit and debit card payments, without the need for complex infrastructure. He admits that one of his initial concerns over switching to digital payments was how his staff would learn to use Square’s app, but says this proved unfounded. “It’s well-designed and easy for staff to pick up – not vastly different to something you’d use in your personal life, and very intuitive.”For those looking to extend customer payment options beyond face to face, there are opportunities to create an e-commerce store and take online payments. This can be done via one of Square’s partners, including BigCommerce, Wix, Weebly, and Ecwid, where an online store can be created quickly using premade templates and themes, with no coding required. Online stores can also be built via Square’s open source partners, WooCommerce, and Magento, which all have prebuilt Square integrations.Having transformed Plum Duff from a cash-only business to one with digital payment options, for now Moore is content with taking card payments in person. However, he is aware of the benefits that the platform can bring to the business via its additional commerce features. He says: “I’m well aware there’s a lot more that we can do with Square that we haven’t yet explored, for example, loading up the inventory so that we can see what we sell and when. Right now, though, we are just delighted to be able to take card payments, which is something our customers had been requesting for quite a while.”  The payment platform’s UK lead, Sarah Harvey, says: “We are confident that our simple to use, affordable, out-of-the-box solution has a great future here in the UK. In the year since our launch we have met so many small business owners who are benefiting from our technology.” And for many like Moore, who were under pressure to move with the times and bring their businesses into the digital age, there is the added benefit of discovering how easy it is to start using Square, regardless of any limitations to their technical knowhow. “Ian was wary of technology and the prospect of taking cards was daunting for him,” adds Harvey. “However, he realised that he was missing out on a lot of sales because people could only pay in cash. The technology was easy to set up and train staff on, he got his money the next working day, and it has proved fast, efficient and simple for him. The difference has been amazing.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f9955f38d3a55aa0994c2a9e875f972123fdff/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=644cfc766c20d225eb2fdb9ae6f668de","title":"debbie sims africa mike jr black liberation orphan move nine philadelphia","story":"Mike Africa Jr has spent 40 years of his life with both parents behind bars. Then one day in June, his life changed.  Ed Pilkington tells his storyThe placenta was the trickiest part. How to dispose of it without it making a mess that would alert the guards that a child had just been born in a prison cell?There was no medical equipment, no painkillers, no sterilized wipes or hygienic materials of any sort. When it came to cutting the umbilical cord in the absence of scissors, well, that was the easy part: just use your teeth.But Debbie Sims Africa was more stressed about the placenta. It was 1978, she was 22 years old and five weeks into what would turn out to be a 40-year prison sentence.She was determined to give birth on her own without any involvement of the jail officers so she could spend some precious time with the baby. In the end, a co-defendant helped her out, scooping up the placenta in her hands and secreting it to the shower room where she flushed it down the prison toilet.The plan worked. Debbie Africa got to spend three wonderful days with her baby son. She hid him under a sheet and when he cried, other jailed women would stand outside the cell and sing or cough to obscure the noise. She knew it couldn’t last, as jail rules prohibited mothers being with their children. At the end of the three days she informed the jailers of the baby’s existence and, once they had got over their astonishment, they arranged for the mother and son to be separated and for the child to be taken to the outside world. So begins the extraordinary life of Mike Africa Jr, a man born in a prison cell, and his incarcerated parents. As he approaches his 40th birthday in September, he reflects on what a crazy ride it’s been. He was born to a mother accused and later convicted of third-degree murder in one of the most dramatic confrontations with law enforcement of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Not only was Debbie Africa sentenced to 30 years to life for the death of a police officer, so too was her husband, Mike Africa Sr, father to Mike Jr, who was caught up in the same confrontation and given the same punishment.Which makes Mike Jr a penal orphan of the black power movement. For almost 40 years, he visited both his parents in separate penitentiaries but never saw either of them outside prison walls. Last month Debbie was finally released from prison on parole, but his father remains in captivity and to this day he has never seen the two of them together. Debbie and Mike Sr, both now 62, are two of the Move Nine, the group of black radicals who were collectively held responsible for the death of Officer James Ramp during a massive police shoot-out at their communal home in Powelton Village, Philadelphia on 8 August 1978. The group, whose members take “Africa” as their last name as a political badge, were resisting eviction.Move was one of the more extraordinary elements of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Deeply committed to fighting police brutality in African American communities, they were also devoted to caring for animals and the environment. They were like the Black Panthers crossed with nature-loving hippies. Black power meets flower power. They lived in a communal house along with dozens of stray dogs and cats where they would preach their political beliefs day and night at high volume through bullhorns, driving their neighbors to despair. Over time they came to be seen as dangerous non-conformists by the Philadelphia police and city government, leading to a drawn-out confrontation that culminated in the 1978 siege and gunfight involving hundreds of police that saw the death of Officer Ramp and sent nine of the black radicals to prison, potentially for life.The Move Nine were accused of firing the first shot and of killing Ramp. Yet they have always claimed innocence. They deny that they shot at anybody and blame the officer’s death on accidental “friendly fire” from other armed police. Ramp, 52, was a former marine who had served with the Philadelphia police department for 23 years. He was killed by a single bullet. Yet all nine Move members were convicted of his murder.I met Debbie Africa and her son as part of research into incarcerated black radicals that began more than two years ago. The starting point was the Angola Three, former Black Panthers who had endured unprecedented stretches in solitary confinement in Louisiana’s notorious Angola prison.That began a journey that would bring me to interview several members of the Move Nine as well as former Black Panthers and members of the Black Liberation Army who remain incarcerated in some cases half a century after their arrests. It would culminate with a day spent with Debbie and Mike Jr, mother and son, as they celebrated their first time together beyond prison walls.Debbie Africa was eight months pregnant during the 1978 siege. During the shoot-out she was holed out in the basement of the Move house, where she was bombarded by water cannons and tear gas and had to fumble her way out in the dark carrying her first child, her two-year-old daughter Michelle.No evidence was presented at trial that she pulled the trigger or ever touched a gun. But she was convicted nonetheless as a murderer and conspirator.Mike Sr remains behind bars in Graterford correctional institution in Pennsylvania. But last June, Debbie Africa became one of very few black liberationists convicted of violent acts from the 1970s to be released on parole having convinced the board she was no threat to society.Debbie and Mike Jr talked to me at his home in a small town outside Philadelphia just two weeks after she had been released on parole from Cambridge Springs prison. They were both still clearly awestruck to be in each other’s company after so long – Mike’s sporadic prison visits to both his parents were nothing like this.It’s the little things that have dumbfounded Mike Jr most. The first morning after they got back to his house, they were sitting at breakfast wearing no shoes.“It was the first time I’ve ever seen her feet, and it was the first time she’d ever seen my feet since I was three days old in her cell,” he said.Debbie Africa described waves of overpowering emotion. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she said. “I’ll just start hugging him in the supermarket and people will be giving us strange looks.”She talked about the wrench of letting her son go when he was three days old. “It was a hard, hard decision. I wanted what was best for him and I knew that was not to get close to me at any level. So I had to break the bond.”Mike Jr was raised during his childhood by his grandmother and by a succession of different female members of the Move organization as part of its communal ethic. “I was a community kid, I had many mothers,” Mike Jr said in a deadpan voice, as though describing the weather.Every Mother’s Day he makes the rounds of his “mothers”. He drives around bearing cards and flowers which he drops off at the homes of at least six women. He rattled off their names: Bert, Sue, Romana, Pam, Mary, Teresa. Now he’ll be able to put flowers in the hands of his true birth mother. He had no idea who she was, nor who his father was, until he was about six or seven when their relationship to him was made clear to him.“I didn’t know she was in prison, I didn’t know any of it. I thought that the person caring for me was my mother.”He looks back on his childhood and recognizes that some aspects of his upbringing were less than ideal. “Who teaches a kid how to brush his teeth or take a bath but his parents. I didn’t know how to wash my hair ’til I was 15.”Through his childhood he was taken to visit both parents in separate prisons, maybe once or twice a year. But for years he had no idea why they were locked up. When friends at school asked about him about them, he would demur or make up stories because he was embarrassed to reveal his ignorance.It was only when he was 14 and sitting with his father in Graterford that the penny dropped. He asked Mike Sr whether there was anybody held in the prison who had done something really bad, like killing somebody.“He didn’t go on to explain,” Mike Jr recalled. “I was frightened. Was he going to be in here forever? I was crying my eyes out trying to figure it out, but I couldn’t explain to him why I was crying. I couldn’t put it into words.”Mikr Jr said it took him years to put the pieces together. “I was left to figure it out for myself, to fend for myself.”But neither son nor mother are ones to dwell on the wounds of the past. I asked Debbie Africa whether she regretted that by her actions as a black liberationist and Move member she had put her son through so much pain.“There are always going to be things in my life that I wish didn’t happen,” she said. “I do truly wish that what happened to my son hadn’t happened, I do truly. But I look at the man he is now, and I love it.”Having spent two days in the company of Mike Africa Jr outside Philadelphia, I can see what she means. He has turned out remarkably poised for someone with his chaotic childhood résumé.He runs his own small business as a landscape gardener, is married and has four children of his own. He is a proud member of Move, has never owned or even held a gun, and his house is comfortable and full of light, though it was notable how much neater it was the second time I visited following Debbie’s release. At last she has begun fulfilling that ritual of parents everywhere: tidying up after their child’s mess.On Mike Jr’s part he’s similarly delighted his mother has turned out as well-balanced, sociable and positive as she is, given 40 years in correctional institutions. “I feel relief. Big relief. I never knew she would come out alive. When people come out of prison they can be sick in the head, but this transition of her coming to my house has been the smoothest major transformation of my life.”Now the challenge is to help Mike Africa Sr secure parole, and so complete the family. His next appearance before the parole board is in September, and they are all already on tenterhooks.A paradox of Debbie Africa’s release is that under her parole terms she is not able to communicate in any form with her husband because he is classified as a co-defendant and thus is out of bounds. The last time they saw each other in the flesh was in 1986. Since then they had been allowed to write to each other from their cells, and in that way managed to keep their bond alive.Now that the letter-writing has been stopped all they have in terms of connection is Mike Jr acting as a go-between. He lets each parent know how the other is doing. He also acted as my go-between, putting questions to his father which Mike Sr answered in a phone call to him. How confident is Mike Sr, I asked, as he heads into the parole hearing?“I’m confident that I’m going to tell the truth. I’m confident that I deserve parole. I’m confident I would never be considered a danger to the community ever again. We never intended for anyone to get hurt, and regret that anyone did get hurt.”Then he added: “What I’m not confident about is what they’re going to do, I have no control over that.”He said the knowledge that his wife was now at home with his son and daughter was a great comfort to him. But it also heightened his desire to be with them all.“Forty years of wanting, anticipating. It’s like Double Dutch. You’re always on the edge of that jump rope, hopping up and down, waiting to get in, waiting for your turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198e774805904308b42318d04704def075d480ba/0_527_2346_1407/master/2346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b49e256137ec739a8e2d6e5c452f0310","title":"st tropez lifeboat crew say luxury boat owners too mean to help out","story":"Tycoons moored on Riviera branded uncaring as lifeboat appeal ‘sinks without trace’The wealthy tycoons and oligarchs enjoying summer on their luxury yachts in Saint-Tropez have been warned: cries of SOS, reports of fires, accidents or persons overboard may take a while to answer.The French Riviera town’s lifeboat is out of action awaiting repairs while its volunteer crew accuse rich yacht captains of being too mean to stump up a few euros to pay for a replacement.Resort Lifeboat officials said their ageing vessel, the Bailli de Suffren II, in service for more than 30 years, needed a spare part from Italy, and that it would not be putting to sea in the next two weeks.The Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM) at Saint-Tropez has ordered a new €1.4m lifeboat, which is now under construction in Brittany with a delivery date for next spring. But it needed another €200,000 to pay for it to be equipped with high-tech electronic devices and for its delivery, the society said.The SNSM wrote this year to wealthy iniduals and companies owning luxury yachts moored at Saint-Tropez, asking them to put their hands in their pockets. The town is a playground of the global super-rich.Pierre-Yves Barasc, the president of the Saint-Tropez lifeboat station, said the appeal sank almost without trace. The owner of one modest boat sent a €10,000 donation but the tycoons and oligarchs failed to come up with a centime.Barasc told the local edition of the news outlet Var-Martin: “They said it wasn’t their problem. That’s not true. On the bigger boats last year we saved an eight-month-old baby. We also saved three youngsters caught on rocks – not a word of thanks, even from their father. Nothing! It’s almost as if it’s their right. It’s great to shower the young ladies with a bottle of €50,000 Cristal champagne, but they could be a little more restrained and help us a little more.“We asked all the owners of important boats. No reply, except one promise never kept. A lone boat, far from being the biggest, gave €10,000. If 30 people had done the same we could have had our new lifeboat quicker.”Barasc said he hoped his “angry outburst” had made people realise that the lifeboat service needed donations. “We are run by volunteers and we have to find the money ourselves to run the service from A to Z. It’s not just saving people at sea, we get called to fires, evacuations, and we do training in schools and address pollution issues.“We have wasted two years to change the lifeboat because we didn’t have the money and the result is our old boat broke down and is out of action for seven weeks. It’s distressing.”The SNSM said it had a semi-rigid boat and could call on neighbouring lifeboats in a serious emergency.A member of the organisation said they had been looking at the UK’s Royal National Lifeboat Association for inspiration on how to raise funds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb69a66f0fb4d15dba02aa617e98c915b855ce10/0_0_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e98b0bc86f5e91c69d6438b4538c3b","title":"zimbabwe votes first post mugabe election pictures","story":" Voters are casting their ballots in the country’s first election since the authoritarian leader was ousted last year.

One involves the construction of a rail bridge over the road, the other would see the construction of a railway “cutting” allowing the train to travel under the road.Documents prepared by the NTA state that both options require more design work, but would add in the region of €25-€35 million to the line’s €3 billion budget.However, Labour senator Kevin Humphreys said both options should be rejected.“The bridge option is unacceptable. It would lead to further inconvenience for residents with noise pollution travelling over a much wider distance from an elevated line.”Sending the train under the road raised engineering difficulties and safety concerns he said. “This part of the road has been flooded in the past and it’s unclear how they will resolve that. But there’s also a worry, particularly if there will be unmanned trains on the line, of the train being briefly underground, only to emerge again.”The best solution, Mr Humphreys said, was to continue the tunnelled section of the line, which in the current plans ends at Charlemont north of Ranelagh, throughout the southside.“The only way forward is for the line to remain underground on the southside as well as the northside. What we’ve been shown so far in terms of other solutions has been haphazard and given to us in a drip, drip feed of information.”The NTA said it plans to complete the designs later this month, with a view to releasing the revised line for public consultation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580040.1532886951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gp shortage i didn t see any future in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Patrick Kelly at Dr Kelly’s Medical Treatment Facility in the Golan Heights. Dr Ruth Caden completed her general practice training in rural Ireland, witnessing the ever-increasing workload with reduced resources that her GP colleagues were facing.“They could often not take holidays as there was no cover, they would do unpaid house calls in the evenings after work. Although they did it largely without complaint, I could see how this could lead to burnout,” Caden says.“The GPs I worked with were tireless in their work for their communities and invested heavily in their practices, some in primary care centres, only for the Government to unilaterally slash the practice income by 38 per cent.”Caden worked in Ireland for six years before leaving for Vancouver Island, Canada. Remuneration and working conditions for GPs are better in places such as Canada and Australia, according to Caden. But if the Government was to make a serious commitment to changing working conditions for GPs, she would consider returning.“So far, unfortunately I have seen nothing to show that they are serious about this, and I have a significant concern that general practice as we know it will be killed off by this Government. This will impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, who disproportionately rely on general practice.”Last home for a holiday in October, Caden sees little hope of returning as working conditions for GPs remain difficult.Dr Dermot Coffey was easily persuaded to leave his homeland in 2002 with his partner due to the “awful working hours” for doctors in Ireland at the time.“The conditions weren’t even the worst they had been – we at least got paid for the hours we worked – but I remember working out we averaged 78 hours a week that whole year, and every fourth week was 100 hours,” he says.Coffey and his partner (now wife) headed for New Zealand where they live with their three children, despite a few stints working in Ireland in 2004 and 2009.A recent holiday to Ireland prompted him to think about his reasons for leaving and roused mixed feelings on returning.“Like a lot of people I imagine I’ve felt the pull back a lot more strongly since we’ve had kids, and although I’ve a brother and his family out here now, the distance seems a lot further than it did when we moved 16 years ago,” he says.“I’ve never been one to hold with the view that medicine is a ‘vocation’, or that Irish graduates should be bonded to the country, but I have felt in more recent times a feeling that we as medics should all be chipping in to help the Irish health system, and a desire to make whatever little difference I could has added to the drawback.”Coffey finished his GP training in 2007, worked as a GP in Wellington until 2016 and has just returned to work in Christchurch after spending two years in Melbourne, where his wife completed training as a geneticist.“Would I come back? I would. I wouldn’t expect perfection but I’d like to see some hope for general practice first.”Motivated less by a desire to avoid the challenging working conditions in Ireland and more by a yearning to care for some of the world’s poorest populations, Commandant Dr Patrick Kelly joined the Defence Forces in 2014 after completing his GP training in Ireland.Kelly is acting senior medical officer with the UN’s Quick Reaction Force, and will leave Syria for a holiday in Ireland in August. He will enjoy a three-week break here before returning to the Golan Heights as part of the UN mission, hosted by the Syrian Arab Republic.The Waterford native became a member of the Order of Malta aged 12 and grew to appreciate caring for people and the human element of healthcare.“A career in the Defence Forces has offered me the opportunity to provide healthcare to people who really need it refugees, internally displaced populations or to persons living in resource-poor settings. I’ve been able to care for various groups from orphans of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone to internally displaced persons as a result of the Syrian civil war.His current role is to provide for the primary care needs of 130 soldiers, as well as preventing the outbreak of disease, which can occur in people situated in close quarters.His other role is as a doctor of the Quick Reaction Force, which is in effect an emergency service for UN unarmed military observers who are overseeing the area of separation between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic as part of the UNDOF mandate.Kelly says he may one day consider working in Irish general practice, but for now, on the whole, enjoys the variety offered by his work abroad.“You miss family events, but you have to take the good with the bad,” he says.Dr Cróchán O’Sullivan, consultant interventional cardiologist, returned home to live in Ireland in recent weeks after spending seven years working in Switzerland.The Kildare native graduated in medicine in 2004. Since then he has moved city and country 11 times.In 2011, he went to Switzerland. O’Sullivan wanted to be an interventional cardiologist and there was no training opportunities in Ireland.“The main reason people move is for training, I think,” he says.“When you’re training in Ireland you have a very pessimistic outlook of the future . . . I didn’t see any future in Ireland. I felt that I had to go abroad and make the most of it over there.”Amid the pessimism and lack of training opportunities in his chosen speciality O’Sullivan, a qualified doctor, made the difficult decision to move abroad to train, unpaid.“When you move abroad first you don’t get paid, you don’t get a salary for working for the hospital and have to find your own funding. When I moved to Switzerland first I got a grant from the HSE that lasted a year . . . then I was lucky to get another grant for a year.”Last year, he and his wife had a child, which he says “was the impetus for us to come home”.Looking for a job in Ireland, he spoke to “very disillusioned” colleagues working in the public sector due to consultant pay concerns and limited resources.Having specialised in innovative, new valve procedures in Zurich, O’Sullivan wanted to continue this work in Ireland and private hospitals, with superior resources, offered better opportunities, he says.He has taken up a role in the Bon Secours Hospital Cork and is excited about the positive outlook there. Whereas the outlook within the public sector “appeared to be more negative”, he says.Irish academic fellow in geriatric medicine Dr Mary Ní Lochlainn, who works for the National Health Service in London, says she cannot “imagine ever not being paid for my work or having to chase my due pay” unlike her Irish counterparts.Ní Lochlainn has never worked for the HSE and has only been in Irish hospitals as a medical student, but even as a patient here found the two-tier health system “very troubling”.She chose to move abroad for a number of reasons.“I was influenced by many fantastic consultants in geriatric medicine as a medical student in Trinity, all of whom had spent time training in the UK. So I definitely felt I would go to the UK at some point. I also moved for the training opportunities and to experience the NHS, as well as the more forgiving hours and better working conditions.“The NHS is the most incredible system, I feel deeply privileged to work there. Money is never a consideration in my day-to-day clinical work, nobody mentions insurance, and everyone gets the same treatment regardless of their classcolourcreedbank balance. It is not perfect, with Tory-underfunding, but nevertheless it is a phenomenal institution.”Ní Lochlainn, like junior doctors in Ireland, must move hospitals as part of her training post. But, she only moves between hospitals in south London.“I don’t have to move to opposite ends of the country away from loved ones, moving house regularly, etc. This is a big consideration of mine when I think about moving home,” she says.Most importantly, she believes unequal pay for consultants is a huge factor for Irish doctors abroad. “Why should those of us who qualified later be penalised and paid less for the same work?” she asks. “It is utterly demoralising. I worry about my parents and extended family being in Ireland where the waiting lists are ever growing. Unless we sort out this demoralisation, there will be more empty posts, and no doctors to clear these waiting lists.“I’m not sure the general public realise that they are the ones who will suffer if these issues are not resolved by Government as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582310.1533076588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"amnesty decision spurs move to set up electoral commission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmnesty International Ireland executive director Colm O’Gorman said the agency’s primary concern was with the law and the “vague wording” and “overly broad application of the Electoral Act”. Photograph: Cyril ByrneIt all comes back to the legislation.The lack of clarity in the Electoral Acts around funding, foreign donations and the definition of political purposes is the one area all interested parties agree on in the Amnesty International v Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) High Court case.Yesterday the court quashed a ruling, made in November 2017, that Amnesty International should refund a €137,000 donation from the Open Society Foundations funded by international financier and philanthropist George Soros.Sipo accepted that its decision the donation was for political purposes and must be returned was “procedurally flawed” and is making a €16,000 contribution to Amnesty’s legal costs.The donation was made in 2015 and Amnesty said it was to fund the agency’s 2016 campaign to increase public support for repealing the Eighth Amendment on abortion.Under the Electoral Acts (1997, amended in 2001) donations above €100 must be declared to Sipo, the State’s public ethics watchdog.Donations from outside Ireland are banned unless from an Irish citizen.Anti-abortion campaign groups repeatedly highlighted the donation as illegal and a foreign influence on the abortion referendum campaign.Amnesty International Ireland said the funding was related to work that was targeted at the Government rather than the electorate.The objectives included increasing support among politicians for the holding of a referendum. No referendum on the Eighth Amendment was planned or had been called when the donation was made, Amnesty said.Subsequently, media reports on documents leaked from the Soros-funded foundation suggested that the funding was part of a strategy to force the repeal of the amendment.Sipo, in November 2017, then wrote to Amnesty referring to obligations under the Electoral Act and said it had to refund the donation.Amnesty claimed it and other non-governmental organisations were extremely concerned about the implications of the decision.It feared the matter could be referred to the Garda, leading to a possible criminal prosecution, if it did not return the donation and it challenged the Sipo ruling in the High Court.The settlement between the parties centres on that concept that it was “procedurally flawed”.In December last year Sipo issued a statement in which it said it “sought and received written confirmation from the donor that the funding was for explicitly political purposes”.But the Open Society Foundations refuted the allegation and said it “has provided no such confirmation to Sipo, and we have written to the regulator requesting that they correct any public statements to the contrary”.Welcoming the resolution of its legal challenge, Amnesty International Ireland’s executive director Colm O’Gorman said the agency’s primary concern was with the law and the “vague wording” and “overly broad application of the Electoral Act”.Sipo itself has pointed out that the wording is open to a range of interpretations and, in response to the case, renewed its repeated calls – the first in 2003 – for the 1997 and 2001 Electoral Acts to be amended.Last week, its annual report called for amending legislation and for an electoral commission to be established, highlighting the advent of more referendums and the potential for foreign-financed and influenced digital campaigns.John McGuirk, formerly of the Save the 8th campaign, said it was important to note that the findings were that Sipo’s decision making was “procedurally flawed”.McGuirk, speaking in a personal capacity, said: “It’s tremendously unfortunate that the actual point of law doesn’t appear to have been clarified.”Deirdre Garvey, chief executive of the national association of charities The Wheel, said that lack of clarity could “potentially muzzle legitimate and important voices in civil society, including community organisations, non-profits, charities and international NGOs when making representations to government”.The Department of Local Government in its response to the case said plans are “advanced” for the establishment of an electoral commission. Proposals are “anticipated” to be brought to Government in the autumn.Once established the commission will have responsibility for the whole area of funding, foreign donations and campaigns.O’Gorman has been sharply criticised for failing to return the funding and for taking the case. But by doing so he has brought the issue centre stage and the State, after 15 years of appeals by Sipo as ethics watchdog, is finally acting."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582371.1533063721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar government can be flexible on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  pictured during a media briefing at Government Buildings. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stressed that the Government is prepared to be “flexible” on the exact content of the Border “backstop” but would not compromise on what it must achieve.Mr Varadkar made the comments while speaking to journalists on Tuesday at a briefing at Government Buildings.“When it comes to the backstop, our position has always been what matters is not the detailed legal text, it’s the outcome, and so what we want the backstop to achieve is a guarantee that there won’t be a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said.He said that while the Government was “totally enthusiastic” about solving the problem of the post-Brexit Border when the EU and the UK agree on a future relationship, the Irish Government would not back down on its insistence that the backstop is part of a withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU – due to be agreed by mid-October.In the absence of a withdrawal treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU next March without a transition period – meaning that EU laws and agreements would cease to apply to the UK overnight.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.“We have to have the backstop as well. We have to have that assurance that unless and until a new solution is in place, that there won’t be a Border.“But yes, we can be flexible certainly on the content of it so long as the outcome is the one that we need,” Mr Varadkar said.Senior Government sources said they expect little progress on Brexit in the coming weeks, but that the UK and EU negotiating teams would restart talks in the middle of August in the hope of reaching a breakthrough on the Border issue in September.Sources acknowledge that the British ask – to have the UK effectively remain in the single market for goods – would have advantages for Ireland, but say it is unlikely to be accepted by Paris or Berlin, as it would compromise the EU’s single market rules.Mr Varadkar also indicated that the Irish and British governments will make another push in the autumn to bring the Northern parties back to the table at Stormont, with a view to resuscitating the powersharing institutions before the end of the year.“We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together. I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult, but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running,” he said.He said that\u0026nbspa Border poll at this time would be “very isive and unsuccessful”.“Now is not the time to get into all that,” Mr Varadkar said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Patrick Browne Waterford City and County Council has become the first local authority in the country to hear pitches from prospective presidential election candidates, but is unlikely to decide on a nomination until September.Senator Joan Freeman, businessman and broadcaster Gavin Duffy and retired Aer Lingus employee Patrick Feeney made presentations to the council at a special meeting on Tuesday afternoon.The council will now wait until after the ministerial order for the presidential election is made, probably in September, until it decides to nominate anyone, or not.The first to make her submission was Ms Freeman, who said she had three ideals for her presidency: a republic of wellbeing a republic of initiative and a republic of justice.“I know,” she told councillors, officials and a large gathering of media personnel, “that the role of the president is above policy-making, but it’s not above the role of principle.”She will create a national assembly for the wellbeing of the country in her first six months in office, if elected, Ms Freeman said, and appoint “key members in this discourse” as members of the Council of State. “We all know there’s no greater power than the power of the spoken word.”The Independent candidate, who founded the suicide crisis charity Pieta House, spoke of the success of the annual Darkness Into Light initiative, which grew from a charity walk in the Phoenix Park in Dublin into a movement which saw 200,000 people across the country walk to raise funds for Pieta House and raise awareness of its work.“In this country, some people are more equal than others,” she said, adding that “officialdom” has shown little respect to many vulnerable people such as the women affected by the cervical test scandal, families living in homelessness and mothers who had their children sold into adoption.“The president cannot tell the taoiseach what to do, but she can speak when something is fundamentally wrong in Irish society. She can say the Irish people are disgusted with the scandals that have brought shame onto the country.”Ms Freeman was asked by Fianna Fáil councillor Adam Wyse if, as a “No” voter in the recent abortion referendum, she would sign the resultant legislation into law, and said that while she did vote No, she would “absolutely respect the vote” of the people and sign the act into law. “I voted No, but I didn’t vote No for religious reasons, I voted No because I spend all my adult life trying to conserve life.”Businessman and Dragons’ Den television star Gavin Duffy told the meeting that recent opinion polls showed that the people want a presidential election. He said he has been “an advocate against ageism” for years and he had “no difficulty” with President Michael D Higgins going forward for the position again. “What I do believe is that, if he’s successful, he should return to the Áras with a mandate.”His “vision for the presidency” is to represent the people of Ireland and be their voice at home and abroad, Mr Duffy said. “I want to inspire us to bring out the best in all of us to achieve our potential.”One of the issues he highlighted was that of youth unemployment and he spoke about how the city hosting his presentation, Waterford, was an unemployment blackspot. “If a president is coming to Waterford and visiting those initiatives that are addressing youth unemployment in general, but particularly youth unemployment, the Government mandarins, mainly based in Dublin, have to sit up and do something about it. Because I’ll be back and keep returning until something is done about an issue like youth unemployment.”Mr Duffy’s membership of the Ward Union Hunt in Co Meath has been under scrutiny lately and he addressed this issue by saying that, while he doesn’t himself hunt with the Ward Union Hunt, he “stepped into the breach” when there were moves some year ago to have it banned.“The Ward Union Hunt are the keepers of the indigenous red deer here in Ireland.”In response to questions from Cllr Eamon Quinlan (FF) on any relationship or otherwise with Nama developers or Anglo Irish Bank, he said: “I can absolutely assuredly say I have never advised a Nama developer in any type of way in terms of press relations.”There was a “photograph” and a two-page story in a newspaper some time ago relating to a meeting with Seán FitzPatrick, but anything further “never happened”, he said.Asked how confident he is of winning the election, he said there is a “popular incumbent President” and it will be a challenge for any other candidate. “I wouldn’t be doing it, risking the amount of finance that I’m risking, if I didn’t believe in my heart of hearts that I can do it . . . I’m confident that I can win this election.”Later, Mr Duffy told reporters he would be “different than Trump” if elected president. “I am not an admirer of Donald Trump as president and I am less an admirer of him as a businessman.”Retired Aer Lingus employee Patrick Feeney, from Galway, who secured 22 votes when he ran in the 2016 general election as an Independent, said he wants to be “the innovation president of Ireland” and wants a nomination for the presidential election “as a challenge for democracy against what’s going on at the moment around politics”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582279.1533057655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"japan s heatwave puts its traditions to the test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe pool at Toshimaen Amusement Park in Tokyo, during Japan’s heatwave. Photograph: Ko SasakiThe New York TimesThe dawn air in Tokyo is still and thick, like a heavy wet overcoat. By early morning, the thermometer is at 28 degrees and starting its climb to a suffocating afternoon peak of 36.In this heat, children surface early. Ours sleep with the air conditioner and fans whirring away through the night, heads lying on rubber ice-pillows. They wake complaining of dry throats.The humidity seeps into futons and clothes and makes the journey from home to train station a sweaty trial. Trains stuffed with perspiring commuters are a great well of rush-hour sullenness.Tokyo summers are rarely pleasant but this year has made everyone a bit neurotic. Heat warnings ticker for days across the TV screen. The weather killed at least 50 people in the city in July alone.The population of Waterford – more than 50,000 people – has been hospitalised with heatstroke. School trips have been called off, outdoor pools closed and summer festivals cancelled.Just before school broke up for holidays, a boy the same age as our oldest fell into a coma and never woke up. He had been out collecting insects in the sun with his classmates.His death panicked some schools into cancelling closing ceremonies in stiflingly hot gymnasiums. Big-city classrooms have air conditioners but their country cousins are often left to nature’s whim.Kids have to be watched, warn the old folk. The children dash out and play for hours, ignoring the telltale signs of heatstroke: tingling extremities, goosebumps, strained breathing, and disorientation.Yet most of the victims are old themselves, passing away unnoticed – sometimes in pairs, such as sisters Shizuko (93) and Miyoko Ogata (84), found lying near each other in their Tokyo flat on July 23rd.Raised in the burnt-out austerity of the post-war years, the elderly often shun air conditioners, either because of the cost or the belief that they weaken the body’s natural defences.Instead, they rely on old tricks: going for walks in the sun to beat the heat downing mugicha (roasted barley tea), cold noodles and heavily salted green beans cooling themselves with paper fans.With heat records tumbling, such traditional remedies are becoming redundant. Another vitamin-rich antidote to the summer – sweetened broiled eel – is running out.Five years ago, after decades of overconsumption, the government designated the eel an endangered species. Prices for it are rising steadily. Japan is the world’s largest consumer.Disappearing fish and overheating planet or not, life goes on. Kids in the park toss baseballs and afterwards scoff kakigori – sweetened shaved ice that is as quintessentially Japanese as sushi.Roads must be fixed. Across Tokyo, men in hard hats descend on potholes and cracks like antibodies around a virus. Some wear clothes fitted with small battery-operated fans.The TV says one-quarter of all skilled construction workers in the country are 65 or older. With the pressure on to finish building before the 2020 Olympics, most work six days a week. The government says it will promote a five-day workweek even as the country struggles with its worst labour crunch in decades. Nobody knows how this is going to be done.In the evening we read how air conditioners are causing summers to heat up even more. Millions of families like ours turn them on to cool down, using more energy, which triggers more emissions.We try opening all the windows in our breezeless apartment. After an hour, the temperature hovers above 26 degrees and the kids toss and turn on damp sheets. The cooler comes back on.In bed, I pick up a story by writer Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904), probably Ireland’s most famous export to this country. In The Dream of a Summer Day he transports himself back to Japan in the eighth-century.“Summer days were then as now,” he writes, “all drowsy and tender blue, with only some light pure white clouds hanging over the mirror of the sea. Then, too, the hills were the same – far blue soft shapes melting into the blue sky. And the winds were lazy.”As we drift off to sleep, fans humming, the comforting thought comes that whatever wreckage we do, the hills, sea and sky will still be here long after we’re gone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582339.1533061847!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain calls on france and germany to force sensible brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris on Tuesday. Photograph: Alain JocardAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has appealed over the heads of Brussels negotiators directly to France and Germany to try to force the European Commission to strike a “sensible and pragmatic” Brexit deal.Ahead of talks with his opposite number in Paris, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of waiting for Britain “to blink” in negotiations as he claimed the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal were “increasing by the day”.“That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,” he said. “There is a real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.”Mr Hunt’s warning came as the Élysée Palace announced that British prime minister Theresa May will join French president Emmanuel Macron at his summer home, Fort de Brégançon, in the south of France on Friday when her holiday in the Italian lakes comes to an end.Ms May’s office confirmed that the pre-planned visit would include talks on the prime minister’s Chequers deal but that the pair would then be joined by Philip May and the president’s wife, Brigitte Macron, for a private dinner.In an interview before his trip to France, Mr Hunt warned the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that his approach to the negotiations would inflict a “breakdown in relations and trust” between Britain and the continent which would be a “profound geo-strategic mistake”.He told the Evening Standard: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink ...“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”However, Brussels insiders have repeatedly pointed out that Mr Barnier and his Brussels negotiating team are only acting on the orders of France, Germany and the rest of the 27 EU countries. Any inflexibility originates from the nation states.France has taunted the UK by offering to roll out the red carpet to British-based financial firms after Brexit, but Mr Hunt said a no-deal Brexit would be an economic “tragedy” for both countries.“If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial,” he said, alluding to the flow of money from the City of London, which could become more difficult to access if there was no agreement.“The City itself would find a way to thrive, whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. If it became a low-tax, low-regulation offshoot fully outside the EU, it would find a way to thrive in those circumstances. But for European businesses the impact would be profound,” Mr Hunt said. –  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here. "},{"url":null,"title":"facebook exposes disinformation campaign to influence us midterm elections","story":"Facebook said it has discovered the first co-ordinated disinformation campaign designed to influence the US midterm elections but stopped short of identifying Russia as being behind the attempts to interfere in US democracy.The social network has been working with the FBI on the attempted interference in the November vote, which follows its discovery of the Russian Internet Research Agency campaign to sow ision in the US during the last presidential election campaign in 2016.Facebook removed 32 pages and accounts from both Facebook and Instagram because they were involved in “co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour”, the company said. Almost 300,000 people followed at least one of these pages, created from March 2017 to May 2018. The pages ran about 150 ads at the cost of around $11,000.Although the company did not accuse Russia of being behind the effort, Mark Warner, a senator and the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said it was “further evidence that the Kremlin” was using social media to “sow ision and spread disinformation”.Donald Trump has come under heavy criticism for his lukewarm backing of US intelligence findings that Russia was behind online campaigns to influence the 2016 presidential election. During their recent summit in Helsinki, President Vladimir Putin of Russia acknowledged he supported Mr Trump, arguing he advocated warner US-Russian ties.Charges filed by the justice department in February charged the Russian Internet Research Agency with using social media to promote isive issues such as Black Lives Matter and allegations of voter fraud.Facebook’s new disclosures included one page that tried to stir up political tensions by organising a Facebook event for a counter-protest to a “Unite the Right” event in Washington this August. Inviting people to “No Unite Right 2 - DC”, they posted information on locations and transport to encourage people to attend.Facebook will now inform these potential attenders that the page was part of the co-ordinated campaign. In total, the pages created 30 events, which about 4,700 people marked themselves as interested in attending.The company said the actors had gone to much greater lengths to disguise their true identities, using virtual private networks and internet phone services and recruiting third parties to run ads on their behalf. It warned that it may never be able to identify the source of the disinformation campaigns with the same level of certainty as it did with the Russian Internet Research Agency.Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cyber security policy at Facebook, said the company had first identified the accounts two weeks ago and removed them all on Tuesday.“As we’ve told law enforcement and Congress, we still don’t have firm evidence to say with certainty who’s behind this effort,” he said. “Some of the activity is consistent with what we saw from the IRA before and after the 2016 elections. And we’ve found evidence of some connections between these accounts and IRA accounts we disabled last year.”Mr Gleicher noted there were differences between the two efforts as well. “While IP addresses are easy to spoof, the IRA accounts we disabled last year sometimes used Russian IP addresses,” he said. “We haven’t seen those here.”Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the revelation by Facebook showed that “malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponise social media platforms to influence the US electorate”.Mr Schiff added that Facebook should continue to “proactively identifying these actors, notifying Congress and law enforcement, and taking necessary steps to remove the foreign influence content”.The Facebook development comes as US lawmakers continue to express concern that the country is not adequately prepared to fend off attacks ahead of the November congressional midterm elections.Dan Coats, the US director of national intelligence, earlier this month warned that “the warning lights are blinking red again” over the threat of cyber attacks on US infrastructure.The most followed Facebook pages were “Aztlan Warriors”, “Black Elevation”, “Mindful Being”, and “Resisters”. Facebook uncovered the pages because one of the IRA accounts that it disabled in 2017 shared a Facebook event hosted by the “Resisters” page and one of the admins for the page previously had an IRA account for just seven minutes.The Resisters page posted anti-Trump content, including a post showing the president tweeting with a caption: “If Trump wants to beat Barack Obama’s Twitter record for the most liked tweet he only needs to tweet 2 words ‘I resign”.Both the Resisters page and the Black Elevation page, which included imagery of Huey Newton from the Black Panthers, advertised vacancies for part-time event co-ordinators.

claims were misleading customers after it found that 20.1 per cent of Gatwick Express trains between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed, with the majority due to reasons within the operator\u0026#39s controlGatwick Express must no longer claim it runs non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour and in just 30 minutes after advertising watchdogs found one in five trains is delayed.The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claims were misleading customers after it found that 20.1 per cent of Gatwick Express trains between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed, with the majority due to reasons within the operator\u0027s control.The Gatwick Express charges a premium above other slower trains on the same route, on the basis that it offers the fastest service. The ASA\u0027s decision comes after two separate complaints that a poster and website for the service, seen in March and featuring the claim that the journey took 30 minutes, were misleading.Train delays are at their highest for a decadeGovia Thameslink Railway, trading as Gatwick Express, said a total of 79.1 per cent of scheduled trains between Victoria and Gatwick arrived at their final destination on time between April 30 and May 26.It listed three unforeseeable exceptions to the planned services - if access was required for engineering work, if there was a failure with infrastructure such as signalling or points, or if there was an unavoidable incident such as a passenger falling ill - and said they were contractually obliged to adjust services for safety reasons such as speed restrictions.It also argued that it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays such as staff sickness, and said any driver involved in an operational incident had to take a set amount of time off work.The ASA said consumers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside their control.10 simple secrets to saving money on UK rail faresIt said: Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0027s control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express\u0027s control.As

secretary accused ignoring dementia","story":"In the open letter to Mr Hancock, the charities urged the health secretary to put dementia \u0026#39at the heart\u0026#39 of plans for the NHSDementia charities have warned the new health secretary they are deeply concerned he is ignoring the greatest health challenge of our time.Senior figures from Alzheimer’s charities have accused Matt Hancock and NHS chief executive Simon Stevens of failing to prioritise the area, as they embark on a 10 year plan for the health service.Since Mr Hancock was appointed health secretary last month he has set out a number of priorities, including workforce, technology and prevention of ill-health.And Simon Stevens has said a £20bn investment in the NHS promised by Theresa May will see an expansion in services including cancer and mental health, with no mention of dementia.What are the early signs of dementia?In the open letter to Mr Hancock, senior figures from Alzheimer’s Research UK, Dementia UK, and Alzheimer’s Scotland urged the health secretary to put dementia “at the heart” of such plans.The charities also urge the Government end inequities faced by those with the disease by reforming the social care system, in a green paper due later this year.“With the Rt Hon Matt Hancock’s recently-announced priorities for the health and social care system, and priorities set out by Simon Stevens for NHS England’s 10-year plan, we are deeply concerned that dementia has not been recognised in these top areas of focus,” the charities write.“It is difficult to imagine any strategic plan that fails to acknowledge the UK’s leading cause of death,” they warn, describing dementia as “the greatest health challenge of our time”.Hilary Evans, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Dementia takes a huge amount of resource for the NHS – one in four hospital beds are occupied by people with dementia, and the condition currently costs the UK economy more than cancer and heart disease combined. It’s imperative that our health system is able to respond to the challenges dementia poses today and in the future, and we must begin by placing dementia at the heart of its priorities. Dementia should not be seen as a problem for the future, but as a challenge that we can address today, if we take action now.”In 2015 Mrs May’s predecessor David Cameron – now president of Alzheimer’s Research UK – launched a Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia, including £300m towards trials to find a cure.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “We remain committed to making this the best country in the world for dementia care, support, research and awareness.That’s why we continue to make progress in improving diagnosis rates, ensuring better access to care and support, increasing public awareness and funding for dementia research.”Alistair Burns, national clinical director for dementia and older people’s mental health at NHS England said: “NHS England is committed to offering support for patients diagnosed with dementia and over the last few years has seen the diagnosis rate increase from half, to more than two thirds of patients, enabling earlier care and support.We maintain a focus on diagnosis and support for people with dementia and their carers, as we develop the ten year plan.”Passengers escape death as AeroMexico plane crashes in Durango, MexicoUS judge blocks release of 3D gun blueprints amid uproarBBC don\u0026#39t televise Monty Python today because it shows how bad modern comedy is, John Cleese claimsRussian journalists killed in Central African RepublicBreast cancer treatment can double heart risks   Gatwick Express told to ditch \u0026#39Get there in 30 minutes\u0026#39 claim as one in five services is delayed NHS mortuaries so lax families are at “significant risk” of burying the wrong bodies, watchdog finds  Jeremy Corbyn issues personal apology as anti-Semitism row boils overDuty of Care: Warning over link between depression and video game addiction as MRI scan shows proof Calais Jungle child refugees denied UK entry because Home Office denied them right to appealPlay centre chaos: \u0026#39Major incident\u0026#39 after man in Bradford \u0026#39storms building and falls from height\u0026#39Comment: Let\u0026#39s end the disgraceful treatment of ex-British soldiers over Bloody Sunday\u0026#39Betrayal\u0026#39 of British soldier interrogated by police over Bloody Sunday \u0026#39attempted murder\u0026#39Comment: While IRA terrorists sit at home relaxed, ageing British soldiers live in trepidationRoad rage murder: Manhunt after father is beaten to death on his doorstep after clash with motoristSaudi\u0026#39s King Salman swaps extravagant foreign holiday for staycation at futuristic resortDonald Trump\u0026#39s former campaign boss Paul Manafort appears in court in first test for Russia investigationSt Tropez lifeboat appeal founders as luxury yacht owners \u0026#39too mean\u0026#39 to help pay for a new oneComment: Today\u0026#39s snowflakes expect luxury, but slumming it is what university is all about We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/31/TELEMMGLPICT000170696803_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"rivals claim victory amid zimbabwean election delays","story":"Supporters cheer as they gather at the MDC Alliance headquarters in HarareZimbabwe’s government has warned candidates could be jailed for prematurely announcing election results after Nelson Chamisa’s opposition MDC Alliance claimed to have won the general election and suggested it would call supporters on to the streets if the official result favoured Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president.Mr Chamisa, a 40-year-old lawyer and preacher, said he was “winning resoundingly” as counting got under way and called on the country’s electoral commission to “perform their constitutional duty to officially announce the people’s election results”.But Zimbabwe’s electoral authorities had announced the results from just seven parliamentary constituencies by Tuesday evening, and made no comment on the outcome of the presidential race.Zimbabwean law forbids anyone other than the electoral commission from announcing results.“As a government we have noted with concern the actions and conduct of some political party leaders... who are openly declaring that they will announce results irrespective of provisions of the law,” said Obert Mpofu, the home affairs minister, at a media briefing in Harare.“I am sure no one wants to provoke the wrath of the law and risk being sent to jail.” Electoral officials and the country’s main observer organisation reported an unprecedented 80 per cent turnout in Zimbabwe’s first presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup in November. Zimbabwean law says official results must be released within five days of the poll.If no candidate in the presidential race wins more than 50 per cent of the vote there will be a run-off on Sept 8.Justice Priscilla Chigumba, chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), said Tuesday evening that Zanu PF had won seven seats in the 210-member parliament and the MDC Alliance one.She said the presidential result would not be released until returns from more than 10,000 polling station had been collated. But the delay drew allegations of fraud from the MDC, which insisted it already had proof from polling station observers that it had won the election and accused officials of delaying publication in order to falsify the vote.Zimbabweans check the results posted outside a polling station in Bulawayo“We have been pushing ZEC to announce the results. The results are posted outside of polling stations. We have collected those results,” said Tendai Biti, a former MDC finance minister who ousted the Zanu PF incumbent in Harare East on Monday.Asked whether the opposition would attempt to challenge the result with peaceful protests, he said: “Constitutionally it is the right of every Zimbabwean to come out on to the streets.”The election commission said it had seen no evidence of cheating and that it was operating strictly within the law.A senior Zanu PF member who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr Mnangagwa had clearly secured the presidency and that the ruling party would maintain a parliamentary majority.But he conceded that Mr Chamisa appeared to have done “better than we had hoped” and that it was unclear whether Zanu PF would achieve its goal of a two-thirds majority, which would allow it to amend the constitution.Emmerson Mnangagwa attends a rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, on July 28, 2018There were no disturbances reported in Harare last night. However, a large crowd of MDC supporters gathered outside the opposition headquarters to celebrate “victory” while riot police equipped with water cannons were seen patrolling in city centre.Meanwhile, Mr Biti accused Gen Constantino Chiwenga, the vice president and mastermind of the coup that ousted Mr Mugabe, of ordering the assassination of Mr Chamisa and himself. George Charamba, the spokesman for Mr Mnangagwa, called the allegation “bizarre.”The vote has been seen as a key test of Mr Mnangagwa’s willingness to break with the violence and corruption of Mr Mugabe’s 37-year rule.Africa\u0026#039s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#039s economy reelingForeign diplomats have told the Zimbabwean government that it may be readmitted to the Commonwealth and could see relief from US sanctions that currently prevent IMF loans if the election passes off peacefully and without cheating.However, whoever wins the vote will inherit a crisis-ridden economy with an unemployment rate of up to  90 per cent and a critical shortage of hard currency.Please review our commenting policyPassengers escape death as AeroMexico plane crashes in Durango, MexicoUS judge blocks release of 3D gun blueprints amid uproarBBC don\u0026#39t televise Monty Python today because it shows how bad modern comedy is, John Cleese claimsRussian journalists killed in Central African RepublicBreast cancer treatment can double heart risks   Gatwick Express told to ditch \u0026#39Get there in 30 minutes\u0026#39 claim as one in five services is delayed NHS mortuaries so lax families are at “significant risk” of burying the wrong bodies, watchdog finds  Jeremy Corbyn issues personal apology as anti-Semitism row boils overDuty of Care: Warning over link between depression and video game addiction as MRI scan shows proof Health Secretary accused of ignoring dementia Calais Jungle child refugees denied UK entry because Home Office denied them right to appealPlay centre chaos: \u0026#39Major incident\u0026#39 after man in Bradford \u0026#39storms building and falls from height\u0026#39Comment: Let\u0026#39s end the disgraceful treatment of ex-British soldiers over Bloody SundayComment: While IRA terrorists sit at home relaxed, ageing British soldiers live in trepidation\u0026#39Betrayal\u0026#39 of British soldier interrogated by police over Bloody Sunday \u0026#39attempted murder\u0026#39Road rage murder: Manhunt after father is beaten to death on his doorstep after clash with motoristSaudi\u0026#39s King Salman swaps extravagant foreign holiday for staycation at futuristic resortDonald Trump\u0026#39s former campaign boss Paul Manafort appears in court in first test for Russia investigationSt Tropez lifeboat appeal founders as luxury yacht owners \u0026#39too mean\u0026#39 to help pay for a new oneComment: Today\u0026#39s snowflakes expect luxury, but slumming it is what university is all about We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/14/TELEMMGLPICT000001859188_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqT1yghX8zbx7fxQBY89c64XuNz4jGHGsSQrNbcoF3ur4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk government publishes first bio security strategy","story":"Britain must help developing countries to stop new disease outbreaks to prevent deadly epidemics, the Government saysPandemics and epidemicsA deadly disease outbreak like a flu epidemic is one of the worst civil emergencies the country could face and Britain must help developing countries to stop new outbreaks, the Government has said.A flu epidemic in the UK could cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and cost tens of billions of pounds, while disease outbreaks overseas can spread insecurity, harm trade and increase migration, according to the Government\u0027s first biological security strategy.Global migration towards mega cities, international travel and the growing demand for meat in much of the world all make it easier for new diseases to spread worldwide.The spread of biological knowledge and techniques online also means a growing potential for terrorists to try to carry out a biological attack.At the same time the growth of microbe resistance to antibiotics could kill ten million a year more each year around the world..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interestsHome Office document“Significant outbreaks of disease are among the highest impact risks faced by any society,” said Ben Wallace, the security minister, “threatening lives and causing disruption to public services and the economy.”The 46-page Home Office document says Britain cannot sit behind its borders to secure itself against biological threats.“These diseases are not limited by international borders. Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interests.“This impact can be either direct, or indirect through the loss of regional stability negatively affecting trade, causing migration pressures and creating ungoverned spaces in which terrorism and criminality can flourish.”Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThe plan says UK aid that builds up health services in the world\u0027s poorest countries goes “to protecting UK citizens from significant disease threats and securing the UK’s long term national security.”Any new deadly epidemic is likely to come from an animal disease infecting humans. Around 60 per cent of all human diseases and three quarters of all new and emerging infectious diseases are these zoonotic diseases. Recent examples include Ebola and H5N1 bird flu.As growing populations encroach on natural habitats and developing countries demand more animal foods, there will be increasing overlap between humans, domestic livestock and wildlife that could see new diseases jump from one group to another.An outbreak infecting UK livestock of crops could also be highly costly and damaging, the strategy says.Global health - Major threats to UK populationThe strategy says that a deliberate biological attack on the UK is currently judged unlikely. But it says such an attack on the UK or its armed forces “are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term”.Conflicts or economic crises also risk increasing the threat from diseases as health services collapse and immunisation programmes halt for diseases such as polio, diptheria and measlesIn the long term, “climate change will also increase the likelihood of pests and vector-borne diseases spreading to new areas of the globe, as they and their carriers are able to survive in countries where environments would previously not have supported their circulation”.Mr Wallace said: “Britain is a global nation, open to the world and outward facing. This means we are exposed to these risks, both at home and overseas, but it also gives us the opportunity to work with international partners to tackle such threats at source.”Protect yourself and

Sketch.Firms\u0026nbsp‘increasingly concerned\u0027 about looming prospect of no-deal Brexit, says\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and TradersClick to followThe Independent OnlineNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsThe British motor industry has warned that “no one would confess to being Brexit ready” in their trade.\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), argues that his members are “increasingly concerned” about the prospects for the UK leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, in the light of developments since Theresa May published the government’s latest Brexit white paper, which he and the SMMT welcomed.Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has since expressed scepticism about the proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), which would have been of particular value to manufacturing and the automotive sector.In the light of EU resistance, and growing UK political volatility, the chances of the UK going to a “no deal” exit are increasing, meaning that Britain would move to WTO terms, as opposed to staying in the Single Market, the customs union or the FCA.This would imply tariffs of up to 10 per cent in UK-EU trade in cars and parts, and greater bureaucracy in both directions, which would only be partly mitigated by “stockpiling” in the short run, given the demands of “just in time” manufacturing techniques and integrated cross-border supply chains.There is a tail risk that factory production of models such as the Mini at BMW’s plant in Oxford could be disrupted if crucial car components become unavailable.\u0026nbspMr Hawes\u0026nbspadded that the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit was something no-one wished to see and that industry leaders wished to see “all options open as long as possible”.\u0026nbspReflecting on the 1,100 trucks that enter the UK from Europe every day to feed its factories, he said that the eight months remaining until formal Brexit on 29 March 2019 were “a real challenge”.\u0026nbspBritish car production for the home market almost halved in June, compared to the same month a year ago, due to what the industry calls “a perfect storm” of factors that resulted in a freakish result.Landmark EU-Japan deal puts pressure on UK over car manufacturing jobsTrump tariffs could cost Alabama car industry 20,000 jobs, warn unionsGovernment urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitOverall, UK manufacture of cars was just 3.3 per cent down in the year to the end of June 2018, buoyed by exceptionally high demand for British products in certain export destinations, notably Japan (up 77.3 per cent), Korea (up 67.8 per cent) and relatively stable demand in China, the US\u0026nbspand Europe.\u0026nbspAmerica is the biggest single national market for British automotive exports but is dwarfed by the combined market of the other 27 members of the EU, who took just over a half of exports (53.4 per cent in the first six months of 2018).The steep decline in production for UK market specifically (47.2 per cent) was said to be due to certain-one off and some short-run actors, such as manufacturers’ changeovers of model lines, and the hurried adoption of real-world fuel consumption standards, but also from a sharp reduction in UK home market demand, which was in turn driven by continuing weakness in consumer sentiment, uncertainty about the future for diesel cars and the general fog surrounding Brexit.However, given that about four out of every five cars made in Britain goes abroad to be sold, British domestic demand is relatively small contributor to overall demand. The SMMT said it was confident that UK production would end the year at about 1.6 million cars, around the same level as in 2017.Although broadly supportive of the government’s white paper, derided by some critics as “dead on arrival” in Brussels, Mr Hawes added that the FCA is just “an idea at the moment” which required “a huge amount of work and investment” even to make practical.The SMMT’s position remains, as it has since the EU referendum, that the industry requires the same degree of frictionless access to its EU markets as it enjoys today, and that anything that falls short of that will damage competitiveness and, eventually, investment and jobs.Key investment decisions by major companies such as Nissan, Honda and Tata (Jaguar Land Rover) on fresh investment on new models, engines and componentry still hang in the balance.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The SMMT\u0026nbspis firm that any current arrangements, governed by the EU Customs Union and Single Market, should continue until satisfactory new rules have been implemented, not merely agreed in theory or principle.If not, then the negative effects will be felt unremittingly through the 2020s, given the nature of the industry’s investment cycle, driven by relatively long model cycles.\u0026nbspThe industry also called on the government, once again, to provide more clarity about the future of diesel engines, claiming that successive government white papers had failed to do so and had left consumers postponing orders. Mr Hawes called on the Philip Hammond, the chancellor,\u0026nbsp to “give a clear signal that the latest diesels won’t be punished”.\u0026nbspSociety of Motor Manufacturers and TradersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/31/17/apple.jpg","title":"apple after hours stock earnings shares trading market value worth","story":"Created with Sketch.The company managed to beat expectations by selling fewer, but more expensive, iPhonesClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe company posted better than expected earningsShares of Apple Inc have jumped after the company posted quarterly results that beat out Wall Street targets while forecasting revenue above expectations in the current quarter.Those results were fuelled by the sales of their signature product — the iPhone — and revenue services such as the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.The company saw growth in its stock of 3.3 per cent in after hours trading.The immediate spike in shares was not enough, however, to make Apple the first company to be valued at one trillion, but the company has come very close to that moniker and continued growth in future quarters could potentially push it over that line.The company was able to beat sales estimates by selling fewer iPhones, and instead getting the more expensive models to fly off the shelves, analysts say.

Mr Trump has yet to say exactly which product categories he might target with tariffs on Chinese goods, but the taxes could potentially impact products like the Apple Watch, one of the company’s main growth drivers.\u0026nbspReuters contributed to this reportEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/13/Theresa-May-00.jpg  width= 2216  height= 1662  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/13/Theresa-May-00.jpg","title":"brexit uk car industry not ready no deal smmt mike hawes","story":"Created with Sketch.Firms\u0026nbsp‘increasingly concerned\u0027 about looming prospect of no-deal Brexit, says\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and TradersClick to followThe Independent OnlineNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsThe British motor industry has warned that “no one would confess to being Brexit ready” in their trade.\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), argues that his members are “increasingly concerned” about the prospects for the UK leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, in the light of developments since Theresa May published the government’s latest Brexit white paper, which he and the SMMT welcomed.Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has since expressed scepticism about the proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), which would have been of particular value to manufacturing and the automotive sector.In the light of EU resistance, and growing UK political volatility, the chances of the UK going to a “no deal” exit are increasing, meaning that Britain would move to WTO terms, as opposed to staying in the Single Market, the customs union or the FCA.This would imply tariffs of up to 10 per cent in UK-EU trade in cars and parts, and greater bureaucracy in both directions, which would only be partly mitigated by “stockpiling” in the short run, given the demands of “just in time” manufacturing techniques and integrated cross-border supply chains.There is a tail risk that factory production of models such as the Mini at BMW’s plant in Oxford could be disrupted if crucial car components become unavailable.\u0026nbspMr Hawes\u0026nbspadded that the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit was something no-one wished to see and that industry leaders wished to see “all options open as long as possible”.\u0026nbspReflecting on the 1,100 trucks that enter the UK from Europe every day to feed its factories, he said that the eight months remaining until formal Brexit on 29 March 2019 were “a real challenge”.\u0026nbspBritish car production for the home market almost halved in June, compared to the same month a year ago, due to what the industry calls “a perfect storm” of factors that resulted in a freakish result.Landmark EU-Japan deal puts pressure on UK over car manufacturing jobsTrump tariffs could cost Alabama car industry 20,000 jobs, warn unionsGovernment urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitOverall, UK manufacture of cars was just 3.3 per cent down in the year to the end of June 2018, buoyed by exceptionally high demand for British products in certain export destinations, notably Japan (up 77.3 per cent), Korea (up 67.8 per cent) and relatively stable demand in China, the US\u0026nbspand Europe.\u0026nbspAmerica is the biggest single national market for British automotive exports but is dwarfed by the combined market of the other 27 members of the EU, who took just over a half of exports (53.4 per cent in the first six months of 2018).The steep decline in production for UK market specifically (47.2 per cent) was said to be due to certain-one off and some short-run actors, such as manufacturers’ changeovers of model lines, and the hurried adoption of real-world fuel consumption standards, but also from a sharp reduction in UK home market demand, which was in turn driven by continuing weakness in consumer sentiment, uncertainty about the future for diesel cars and the general fog surrounding Brexit.However, given that about four out of every five cars made in Britain goes abroad to be sold, British domestic demand is relatively small contributor to overall demand. The SMMT said it was confident that UK production would end the year at about 1.6 million cars, around the same level as in 2017.Although broadly supportive of the government’s white paper, derided by some critics as “dead on arrival” in Brussels, Mr Hawes added that the FCA is just “an idea at the moment” which required “a huge amount of work and investment” even to make practical.The SMMT’s position remains, as it has since the EU referendum, that the industry requires the same degree of frictionless access to its EU markets as it enjoys today, and that anything that falls short of that will damage competitiveness and, eventually, investment and jobs.Key investment decisions by major companies such as Nissan, Honda and Tata (Jaguar Land Rover) on fresh investment on new models, engines and componentry still hang in the balance.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The SMMT\u0026nbspis firm that any current arrangements, governed by the EU Customs Union and Single Market, should continue until satisfactory new rules have been implemented, not merely agreed in theory or principle.If not, then the negative effects will be felt unremittingly through the 2020s, given the nature of the industry’s investment cycle, driven by relatively long model cycles.\u0026nbspThe industry also called on the government, once again, to provide more clarity about the future of diesel engines, claiming that successive government white papers had failed to do so and had left consumers postponing orders. Mr Hawes called on the Philip Hammond, the chancellor,\u0026nbsp to “give a clear signal that the latest diesels won’t be punished”.\u0026nbspSociety of Motor Manufacturers and TradersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/19/ryanair-valencia.jpg  width= 1862  height= 1397  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/19/ryanair-valencia.jpg","title":"ryanair strikes latest michael o leary ceo jobs poland pilots cabin crew industrial action","story":"Created with Sketch.Pilots voted for industrial action in dispute over promotions and annual leave arrangementsClick to followThe Independent OnlineRyanair boss Michael O’Leary threatens to move jobs to Poland if strikes continueRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has threatened to move jobs to Poland if strikes by the airline’s crews in Europe continue and have an impact on business. The budget travel group’s chief executive told a press conference in Vienna that he was prepared to cut jobs “in any market” if necessary, a week after pilots employed by the firm in Dublin staged two 24-hour strikes. Nearly 100 pilots who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (IALPA) voted to strike in a dispute about seniority, annual leave arrangements and transfers of flight crew between European and North African bases. IALPA members are planning further action for this Friday, 3 August. On Monday, Ryanair pilots in Germany voted in favour of striking, followed by pilots in the Netherlands voting in favour of industrial action on Tuesday. Ryanair cabin crews in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain also downed tools last week, with workers seeking local contracts and better conditions. Commenting on Ryanair’s ongoing dealings with pilots and unions, Mr O’Leary said: “As long as there’s common sense on their side then we’ll reach agreements.“If we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they’ll find themselves (with) jobs getting moved and aircraft getting moved.”The company has previously said it plans to move crew and planes away from Dublin because of the effect industrial action has had on business. Describing Ryanair as “the ultimate opportunistic airline”, he added: “We have today - in Ryanair - 20 markets that need more aircraft. We’re short of aircraft in almost every market in which we operate because of the demand for our prices, our services.“If some market is being damaged as the Irish market has been damaged in recent months by these activities, the Polish market is growing hugely strongly for us, the Ryanair Sun is very full, profitable, we need more aircraft in the Polish market - move aircraft to Poland.”Ryanair: More than 20 flight cancellations blamed on bad weatherRyanair strike: when your boarding pass becomes a raffle ticketRyanair: pilots to strike again on first Friday in AugustMeanwhile, dozens of Ryanair flights were cancelled on Tuesday, affecting routes in and out of London Stansted, due to weather concerns and air-traffic control staff shortages around Europe. At least 7,000 passengers have been affected by the timetable disruption. The airline said: “Ryanair sincerely apologise for these weather and ATC disruptions which are entirely beyond our control.“The knock on effect of this and ATC staff shortages may cause further disruptions throughout the day, including delays and cancellations.” Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/15/14/Philip-Pullman.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1899  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/15/14/Philip-Pullman.jpg","title":"damian hinds preschool children social mobility parents literacy word gap","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027This matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up,\u0027 Damian\u0026nbspHinds will sayClick to followThe Independent OnlineChildren arriving at school unable to speak or read properly is a ‘scandal’, minister saysIt is a “scandal” that young children are\u0026nbspnot able to speak or read properly when they arrive at school, the education secretary will say in his first speech on social mobility.\u0026nbspThis matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up,\u0026nbspDamian\u0026nbspHinds will add as he launches\u0026nbspa coalition of businesses, charities, tech and media groups\u0026nbspto encourage more parents to read and learn new words with their children.He will add: Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”The\u0026nbsplatest statistics\u0026nbspfrom the Department for Education (DfE) showed\u0026nbsp28 per cent of four and five-year-olds lacked the early communication skills – such as being able to talk about events in the past or future – expected by the end of reception year.Mr Hinds will set out his plans to halve the number of children starting school without vital literacy skills by 2028.\u0026nbspAn awareness-raising campaign – similar to the “five-a-day”\u0026nbspcampaign that encouraged more people to eat fruit and vegetables – could be introduced to change busy parents’ behaviour.Mr Hinds will say: “It is a persistent scandal that we have children starting school not able to communicate in full sentences, not able to read simple words.\u0026nbspThis matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up. Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”Mr Hinds will highlight that the vast majority of preschool children spend most of their time at home, adding that the government cannot afford to ignore “the home learning environment”.“I don’t have any interest in lecturing parents here, he will say.\u0026nbspI know it’s parents who bring up their children, who love them, who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children.\u0026nbspBut that doesn’t mean extra support and advice can’t be helpful.The coalition will hold a summit in the autumn to come up with practical ideas that boost parents’ confidence to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbsptheir child’s language and literacy from an early age.Children with poor vocabulary at age five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed aged 34 as children with good vocabulary.Mr Hinds will add there are “legitimate worries about screen time” but he hopes technology can be used to “build parents’ confidence” around early language development.Earlier this month, acclaimed author Philip Pullman said parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, has also raised her concerns about the word gap. Following her speech to nursery leaders, early years experts suggested that the fact a lot of parents were spending time on their phones had contributed to poor language skills among young children.UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

However it can sometimes be difficult to get them involved in their child’s learning and we know little about how to do this well.”Department for EducationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/13/20/pp-child-poverty-2-getty.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/13/20/pp-child-poverty-2-getty.jpg","title":"school holidays hunger poverty national education union food","story":"Created with Sketch.Children\u0026nbspreturn to school \u0027looking visibly less well nourished\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineNearly four in five teachers say \u0027holiday hunger\u0027 is failing to improveHoliday hunger is affecting more children now than it did three years ago, nearly four in five teachers have warned.\u0026nbspThe number of teenagers going hungry during the summer holidays has failed to improve, the poll conducted\u0026nbspby the\u0026nbspNational Education Union\u0026nbsprevealed.\u0026nbspThey also said they were concerned local initiatives designed to tackle the issue, such as food banks, are not equipped to meet the demand.Of 657 secondary school teachers surveyed, nearly half confirmed children in their school had experienced holiday hunger.Seventy-seven per cent said in the last three years the situation had either worsened (51 per cent) or stayed the same (26 per cent).Fifty-nine per cent felt the combined provision of food banks, charityvolunteer organisations and faith groups was insufficient to tackle holiday hunger.\u0026nbspJust five per cent thought it would be enough.One teacher told the survey:\u0026nbsp“I see children come back to school in September looking visibly less well nourished.”A third added: “When many of our children are struggling to get enough food during term time (when over 50 per cent get at least one good meal per day as they are FSM), the problem will obviously be exacerbated during the holidays.”UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

Food banks, faith groups and charitablevoluntary organisations are now being left to pick up the pieces where central government has failed.“Indeed, rather than fix the problem of child poverty, the government has instead attempted to redefine it. Of the services available, demand will clearly outstrip supply. It is shameful that the safety net is so threadbare.\u0026nbspThe government must take steps to tackle the issue of holiday hunger through properly funded and resourced programmes.Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimUN to investigate extreme poverty in the UK – after years of austerityMore than one in 10 households living in fuel poverty, figures showLabour to stop academies paying ‘poverty wages’ while bosses get £100kGiven the scale of the problem the government’s announcement of £2m additional funds to help disadvantaged children with food and fun over the holidays, while welcome, goes nowhere near far enough to tackle the desperate plight of families and children.”It comes after a previous NEU survey found malnourished children are stuffing their pockets with food as the numbers living in poverty grows.The survey found three in five (60 per cent) of school staff believed child poverty had worsened since 2015.\u0026nbspOf those, the vast majority (87 per cent) said it was having a significant impact on the learning of their pupils.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home. So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else. It’s\u0026nbspterrifying and exhilarating, simultaneously desirable and absolutely the last place you would want to be.Then there’s the drop. The wind hits your face, your stomach feels as if it’s leaping through your body, your cheeks are pushed back into a laugh – or a scream – your whole being is lifted, and despite the rigorous health and safety restraints, for a moment it feels like you’re flying. Then you hit the track again and your whole body is pumping along with your heart and you breathe and laugh – and want to go again. Or not. I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The budget travel group’s chief executive told a press conference in Vienna that he was prepared to cut jobs “in any market” if necessary, a week after pilots employed by the firm in Dublin staged two 24-hour strikes. Nearly 100 pilots who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (IALPA) voted to strike in a dispute about seniority, annual leave arrangements and transfers of flight crew between European and North African bases. IALPA members are planning further action for this Friday, 3 August. On Monday, Ryanair pilots in Germany voted in favour of striking, followed by pilots in the Netherlands voting in favour of industrial action on Tuesday. Ryanair cabin crews in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain also downed tools last week, with workers seeking local contracts and better conditions. Commenting on Ryanair’s ongoing dealings with pilots and unions, Mr O’Leary said: “As long as there’s common sense on their side then we’ll reach agreements.“If we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they’ll find themselves (with) jobs getting moved and aircraft getting moved.”The company has previously said it plans to move crew and planes away from Dublin because of the effect industrial action has had on business. Describing Ryanair as “the ultimate opportunistic airline”, he added: “We have today - in Ryanair - 20 markets that need more aircraft. We’re short of aircraft in almost every market in which we operate because of the demand for our prices, our services.“If some market is being damaged as the Irish market has been damaged in recent months by these activities, the Polish market is growing hugely strongly for us, the Ryanair Sun is very full, profitable, we need more aircraft in the Polish market - move aircraft to Poland.”Ryanair: More than 20 flight cancellations blamed on bad weatherRyanair strike: when your boarding pass becomes a raffle ticketRyanair: pilots to strike again on first Friday in AugustMeanwhile, dozens of Ryanair flights were cancelled on Tuesday, affecting routes in and out of London Stansted, due to weather concerns and air-traffic control staff shortages around Europe. At least 7,000 passengers have been affected by the timetable disruption. The airline said: “Ryanair sincerely apologise for these weather and ATC disruptions which are entirely beyond our control.“The knock on effect of this and ATC staff shortages may cause further disruptions throughout the day, including delays and cancellations.” Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg","title":"great pyramid giza egypt electromagnetic energy radio chambers itmo university","story":"Created with Sketch.Revelation could have\u0026nbsptechnological applications such as creating effective solar cells, say researchersClick to followThe Independent OnlineGreat Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic energy through its hidden chambers, physicists revealThe Great Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic radiation into pockets of energy inside its network of internal chambers and underneath its base, a new study has suggested.Theoretical research by a team of Russian scientists aimed to understand how the pyramid would respond to radio waves directed at it, with the goal of recreating its shape at a nanoscale.But far from unveiling and harnessing some mystical property of the ancient structure, the scientists hope to use their findings in technological applications such as creating effective solar cells.Speculation about the supposed function of Egypt’s pyramids has been prevalent since at least the early 20th century, and the structures have been linked with everything from aliens to the apocalypse.As the oldest and largest of the Giza pyramids, the Great Pyramid constructed for Pharaoh Khufu thousands of years ago has\u0026nbspdrawn some of the wildest theories.In their paper, the scientists acknowledge that “these amazing structures excite the imagination of people engendering various fables and baseless assumptions”.This, they explain, is what makes it all the more important for scientists to use modern techniques to explore the real-life mysteries of the pyramids.They used mathematical models to understand how light would react with a hypothetical nanoparticle shaped like the ancient wonder of the world.“Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention,” said Dr Andrey Evlyukhin from ITMO University, one of the study’s authors.“We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.”\u0026nbspTheir research has been\u0026nbsppublished in the Journal of Applied Physics.Tombs of the pyramid builders discovered in Giza, EgyptImages courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)The scientists\u0026nbspfirst estimated that a so-called “resonant” state could be achieved in the pyramid using radio wave lengths ranging from 200m to 600m, meaning electromagnetic energy would be concentrated within and underneath the structure.“Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions,” said Dr Evlyukhin.“For example, we assumed that there are no unknown cavities inside, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid. With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications.”The team’s interest in the Great Pyramid was first roused while they were investigating the interaction between light and certain nanoparticles.Light can be controlled at a nanoscale by varying the size, shape and refractive index of the nanoparticles’ source materials.The Pyramids of Giza are near a Pizza Hut and more disappointmentsArchaeologists find 4,400-year-old tomb near pyramids outside CairoNow, the scientists want to find out if by creating nanoparticles shaped like the Great Pyramid, they can get them to interact with light in the same way it interacted with radio waves – concentrating its energy into specific areas.“Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,” said Dr Polina Kapitanova, another ITMO University physicist.This is not the first time the worlds of physics and pyramid research have collided.\u0026nbspIn a 2017 paper published in the journal Nature, scientists used particle physics techniques to discover a new chamber inside the Great Pyramid – the first to be revealed since the 19th century.\u0026nbspGreat Pyramid of GizaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/rtx9a5l.jpg  width= 2072  height= 1462  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/rtx9a5l.jpg","title":"skype wedding bride groom alexander and dyne biancardi uk france visa home office","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Guests have flown in from around the world for £20,000 ceremony where bride is likely to be missing after visa refusedClick to followThe Independent OnlineAlexander and Dyne Biancardi applied for her visa five months ago and now face being apart for their big dayA couple fear they will be forced to hold\u0026nbsptheir £20,000\u0026nbspwedding ceremony in separate countries after the bride was refused a visa to enter the UK and the Home Office\u0026nbspmissed the deadline to notify them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAlexander and Dyne\u0026nbspBiancardi\u0026nbspface having to marry 210 miles apart – he in England and she in\u0026nbspFrance\u0026nbsp– holding up iPads and using\u0026nbspSkype.\u0026nbspThe couple are expecting 90 guests at a lavish ceremony in Surrey this Sunday that has cost £20,000.

The border guards kept saying ‘how do we know you’re not lying?’“They then said the visa had been denied in May, which we didn’t know. It seemed there was nothing I could say to convince them even though we had a letter from my father-in-law confirming we wouldn’t be claiming welfare.”Mr\u0026nbspBiancardi, an adjunct professor of political science in California, added: The\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspofficers said they had concerns and made us wait 45 minutes. They then put my wife through a torturous process, taking her into an office on her own, while I had to wait outside for two hours.”His mother had put in an “insane” amount of work into the wedding preparations, including a cake, £11,000 of catering, a photographer and booking the venue, amounting to £20,000, he said.\u0026nbspThe family would not have spent that had the Home Office informed them of the visa refusal decision, he\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspThe 90 guests include 15 friends who have flown over from California for the event.US-trained Mrs Biancardi has already sat a law conversion exam, allowing her to practise in Britain\u0026nbspand her husband is due to begin a master’s degree in sociology at Bristol in September. Now they believe their plans might have to be overturned.“We’re desperate to have the wedding but my biggest priority is not to disappoint my family so I’m thinking of still going there for it, she said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been feeling incredibly depressed.\u0026nbspHer fiance added\u0026nbspthat if there\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspstill no way of her\u0026nbspentering Britain before Sunday’s ceremony, one option is for his father to hold up an iPad with a Skype link on it to France while the groom walks down the aisle.“When we found out the spouse’s visa had been rejected it only left a few days to apply for a visitor’s visa but what are the chances of getting that in time? We feel this has been very unjust,” he said.The Independent has asked the Home Office for a comment but it had not replied at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6341451  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg","title":"brexit key dates when uk leave eu transition period theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.All the main events ahead of Brexit Day on 29 March 2019Click to followIndy PoliticsBrexit key dates: When is the UK leaving the EU?As Britain prepares to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, much uncertainty hangs in the air.

There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”Last year, Mr McDonnell had told The Independent that Labour had set up a working group to investigate the feasibility of a basic income – led by one of his economic advisers, Guy Standing. During the height of the attempted coup against Mr Corbyn in 2016, the shadow chancellor also suggested he could “win the argument” on the idea within the Labour Party.In the\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent, Mr McDonnell continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”While the finer details of such a pilot are expected to be set out at a later date, a year long scheme involving 2,000 participants was launched in Finland in 2017 with each inidual receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.A poll last year by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath suggested that nearly half of all Britons (49 per cent) would back such a scheme and proponents include the prominent billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson.UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

I thought we had got to a position where we are able to move on – we’re not – we’ve got to resolve that by September.“The discussion is taking place I think that will enable that to happen.”\u0026nbspPressed for his thoughts on a demonstration earlier this year in Parliament Square, in which hundreds of Jewish people gathered to demand the Labour leader tackle antisemitism in the party, Mr McDonnell said it was “deeply, deeply upsetting”.“I can’t tell you how upsetting it was,” he added. “It really cut you to the core, it really did. You have work these things through.”He continued: “The issue for me is that it’s upsetting but partly because you think how have we got ourselves in this situation, we’ve got to get this sorted it out but also in the life experiences of members of the Jewish community, while we have these disputes going on in the media and elsewhere, there isn’t sufficient campaigning on the ground to tackle those.“You just want to get on with the job of tackling antisemitism – what we should be doing now and I hope we can do is working in inidual communities identifying where the peaks are in terms of the antisemitic incidents, working with the community about how we tackle those that includes working with the police.”On Brexit, he added that there will “almost certainly” be a debate on Brexit at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool this September after the issue had been raised at union conferences and Constituency Labour Party meetings across the country.“There will be a range of policy debates and Brexit is bound to be one of them,” he said. “There’s bound to be debate this year.When pressed on the prospect of a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal – something Labour has consistently refused to rule out – Mr McDonnell said that while the party is “always up for some form of democratic engagement” his preference would be for a general election.“My view is that they should just move over and let us start the negotiations. If they are not willing to do that – general election and let’s decide.”On Labour’s failure to explicitly rule out a fresh referendum, he explained: “Why not? It’s not our policy, it’s not our policy and the worry I have, if you look at the opinion polls, split down the middle still – absolutely split. There’s been movement either way. My worry is that if you go for another referendum we could have an equally spilt vote and ide the country all over again.”Mr McDonnell added that his greatest fear with a second vote would be the “rise of the xenophobic right”, adding: “We’ve already seen that on the Tommy Robinson marches, which has been on a scale that has shocked people and certainly surprised people.“I think there’s a real problem,” he said. “It could be really dangerous if you split the country again and allow that xenophobic right to exploit the issue again. That’s why I’d rather we had a general election and again – as I say – in a general election you’re debating all the issues but you’re also choosing the team who will then go and negotiate.”In the coming months Mr McDonnell said he will be doing what has been promised as an anti-austerity tour of the country in areas he believes the party should have won at the previous election and regions where the party could win next time round. And as part of the Labour’s preparations for the ultimate goal of holding office, he said a Queen’s Speech, linked to a first Budget, was also being planned.But when asked whether he thought the public viewed him as Chancellor-in-waiting, he replied: “You know, I don’t think the public know who I am. We’ve done some polling, as you do, and drilled down into the polling about who knows who. Philip Hammond and myself are hardly recognised – we’re on the same par.“For me, I’m not bothered about personal recognition, it’s whether they understand our policies.“I’m not bothered whether the general public recognise me – we’re not into personality politics. It’s the Tony Benn thing: policies rather personalities. What I am more interested in is making sure people understand our policies, support them, and also we can convince them we have the capability to deliver. In some ways that means being seen as a team overall.He said it’s “not about do I get recognised in the street”, but added: “I do a lot. What’s interesting is that people sit on the Tube opposite, looking at me thinking I know him from somewhere and thinking am I a family member – and it’s really funny.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1607  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg","title":"no deal brexit jeremy hunt france germany theresa may leave eu emmanuel macron angela merkel","story":"Created with Sketch.Appeal comes as Emmanuel Macron invites the prime minister to\u0026nbspurgent talks at his holiday retreatClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Hunt calls on France and Germany to stop no-deal Brexit, insisting Theresa May will not \u0027blink\u0027Jeremy Hunt has called on France and Germany to intervene to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal, insisting Theresa May will not “blink”.The foreign secretary appealed to the EU’s most powerful countries to force Brussels to offer the UK better terms, as he warned the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is “increasing by the day”.It came as Emmanuel Macron, the French president, invited Ms May to break off her holiday for urgent talks at his retreat in the south of France on Friday.Michel Barnier, the EU’s negotiator, and some senior EU politicians\u0026nbsphave ridiculed the notion of Berlin and Paris stepping in to end the deadlock and arrange a more favourable deal for the UK.But Mr Hunt said: “There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel, because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”In an article for the London Evening Standard, Mr Hunt wrote: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation.”Despite backing Remain – and once calling for a fresh referendum on the Brexit deal – he also insisted the UK would “thrive”, even with the massive disruption of no deal.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“I’ve always been someone who believed that, if we ended up with no deal, we would find a way to thrive economically because we are Britain, we are that sort of country. We have solved these kinds of problems,” the foreign secretary wrote.That verdict is strongly contradicted by the government’s own leaked Brexit impact assessment, which warned of an 8 per cent hit to national output without a trade agreement.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned the UK economy would suffer more than the EU’s – losing 4 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.5 per cent across the channel.And ministers have been forced to concede there are emergency plans to ensure food, medicines and blood would still be available after exit day next March.Mr Hunt’s appeal comes after Mr Barnier last week\u0026nbsprejected the UK’s proposals for customs after Brexit, appearing to kill off the prime minister’s Chequers plan.No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsImmigration fears will be ‘exploited’ again in Brexit run-up, MPs fearBrexit is bad for your health UK doctors warn as BMA backs Final SayMay denies army to deliver food and medicines after no-deal BrexitThe chief negotiator also urged the UK not to go behind his back, saying: “Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly.”No 10 confirmed the prime minister would fly to the south of France on Friday, cutting short her holiday in Switzerland and Italy by one day.In his article, Mr Hunt claimed there was a new unity in the cabinet after he replaced Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab replaced David Davis as Brexit secretary.“We have a united cabinet position, we are absolutely clear what we want, we know it’s not just the right thing for Britain, but it’s the right thing for Europe as well,” he said.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/11/India-assam-0.jpg","title":"india assam register citizens bangladesh voting rolls","story":"Created with Sketch.Government claims that hundreds of thousands of people illegally entered country from neighbouring Bangladesh since 1971Click to followThe Independent OnlineResidents queue to check their names on the final list of the National Register of Citizens India has effectively stripped 4\u0026nbspmillion people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.\u0026nbspThe state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.\u0026nbspIndia has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4\u0026nbspmillion people to prove their Indian nationality.Force India in administration but to see out rest of the F1 seasonMan accused of cow smuggling beaten to death by mob in IndiaIndia on brink of biggest gay rights victory since independence India tourism ministry launches campaign to highlight safety of women It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.\u0026nbspThe application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015.

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/997017_1.jpg","title":"nature news uk hen harrier grouse hunting DEFRA","story":"The majestic hen harrier (Image: Natural England)With claims of scores of legally protected birds disappearing mysteriously over the past 15 years, experts say the population of the harrier \u0026ndash known as the sky dancer because of its dramatic courtship display \u0026ndash should number as many as 340 pairs.The past two years has only witnessed three successful nesting attempts in England per season.Today the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced how 34 chicks had fledged from a total of nine nests in Lancashire, Cumbria, Northumberland and Derbyshire.This is the highest number of fledged birds for a decade with the success put down to a series of factors, including the high number of voles, good weather and greater partnerships efforts between conservation groups, shooting estates, gamekeepers and other organisations.                Shark tooth that is 115 MILLION years old found in wineryOne helpful strategy used this summer has been providing \u0026ldquoersionary feeding by land managers to supply young harriers with additional food, stopping their parents hunting gamebirds and other vulnerable ground-nesters.The government\u0026rsquos wildlife agency, Natural England, led the applause for the cooperation between grouse moors and conservationists.Natural England chairman Andrew Sells said: \u0026ldquoThe increase in hen harrier chicks this year is truly remarkable. These figures are a tribute to all those working hard for the survival of this breath-taking bird and show that responsible management of grouse moors must be part of the solution.\u0026ldquoReviving the fortunes of the hen harrier has been a cause close to my heart and I very much hope that we are now on the right path. But it will take more than one good breeding season to bring about a thriving population so it\u0026rsquos important that there is no let-up in the efforts to conserve this magnificent bird.Arguably the most persecuted of all birds of prey because of its liking for prized grouse (Image: )A roll call of organisations in efforts to bolster harrier numbers shows the wide array of interests.Staff from Natural England, RSPB, Forestry Commission, the Moorland Association, United Utilities, Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, the National Trust, Northumberland National Park and Northumberland Wildlife Trust, inidual estates and their keepers, farmers, and a large number of volunteer raptor enthusiasts are being recognised for working together to help harriers.Efforts to protect the harriers have included liaising with shooting estates to find and monitor nests, fitting satellite tags on the birds to track their movements and providing the additional feeding.The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust\u0026rsquos Dr Adam Smith paid tribute to the action plan established to improve the bird\u0026rsquos precarious hold in England.Their population is said to be down to 340 pairs (Image: )\u0026ldquoIt is very important that the hen harrier has bred more widely across England this year than it has for many years, he said. \u0026ldquoWe believe this is in large part because the multi-partner Hen Harrier Action Plan is now gaining traction.\u0026ldquoThat plan\u0026rsquos practical approach is helping confidence build in the land management sector that birds of prey can be part of our cherished sporting moorland landscapes.With the countdown to August\u0026rsquos Glorious Twelfth and the start of the grouse shooting season, Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, says the grouse moors have played a key role in the harrier\u0026rsquos success.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to see this year a substantial improvement in the breeding success of hen harriers across upland England with grouse moors playing a key role in delivering enhanced fledging rates, she said.Some of the world\u0026rsquos greatest wildlife photographers have come together to give a remarkably candid view of our most cherished and elusive birds and mammals at ease in their remote haunts                    Sam Hobson1 of 12The elusive wolverine has witnessed a sharp drop in numbers\u0026ldquoThe Hen Harrier Action Plan has provided a blueprint that should deliver a sustainable and well-dispersed hen harrier population and unlock the predator-prey conflict to the benefit of both species.The RSPB says it played a direct role in protecting seven out of the nine successful nests \u0026ndash there were a total of 14 nesting attempts across England \u0026ndash but warn the hen harrier is still on the edge.Gareth Cunningham, RSPB\u0026rsquos head of species policy, said: \u0026ldquoWhile we acknowledge progress, this species\u0026rsquo population is still at critically low levels and still vulnerable to illegal killing once birds disperse.\u0026ldquoWe know that our English upland landscapes can support many more breeding pairs, indeed this is an international conservation obligation.Coming weeks will see a series of Hen Harrier Day rallies around the country with conservationists highlighting the continuing plight of the bird, they describe as the \u0026ldquomost heavily persecuted in relation to population size in the UK."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/183x122/996253_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news Japan UK trade deal EU liam fox theresa may","story":"But Japanese minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Tokyo would spare no efforts to support the UK in joining CPTPP in a meeting with Dr Fox on his trip to Japan.Mr Motegi said: I\u0027d like to welcome your country\u0027s expression of interest in acceding to TPP11.Your expression of interest is indeed a great encouragement to our efforts to attach importance to the free-trade system based on rules, and to fight against protectionism.Japan will not spare any effort to support the UK, including providing relevant information, and acting as an intermediary to you in relation to other TPP member countries.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of it is common sense.It makes no sense that ferry or rail passengers don’t have to give the same basic info to the Authorities as plane arrivals do.It should go without saying that failed asylum seekers should be sent home quickly, without endless costly judicial reviews at taxpayers’ expense.And to avoid another Windrush scandal we must give official papers to those who have been here for years — especially Ugandan Asians, who came in the ’70s and are most likely to be without. Other recommendations require a bit more thought.But at least Policy Exchange are doing some thinking about Britain’s future. On the other hand, the Government is turning drift into an art form.  Even the much-ballyhoed, super-charged no deal plans that were supposed to be released one-by-one this summer are being quietly shuffled away until one day in late August.Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is right to be “alarmed and worried” .The PM’s Chequers fudge is a direct result of our lack of planning, and until we’re ready to go it alone, Brussels will force us to make more concessions.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

Britain is a NATO partner but not good enough for such a project?“Now that Davis and Johnson are gone in the UK, the EU should also replace Barnier and Verhofstadt to be able to reach an atmosphere of mutual trust.”Mr Henkel, who sits in the same European political grouping as the UK Conservatives, urged the bloc’s negotiators to accommodate Theresa May’s new plan for alignment on goods secured at Chequers.He said: “The new proposal is better than a hard Brexit or no deal. However, a real customs union would be better and so would be uninterrupted access for financial service institutions.“It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.”And the top German MEP also invited top eurocrat Donald Tusk to intervene in the talks and steer Britain away from the exit door.He said the EU Council chief should offer the UK a “new deal” with constraints on free movement to persuade it to stay inside the bloc.He said: “Still better would be for both, Britain and the EU, to call the whole thing off.“For that I ask President Tusk to offer Britain a New Deal, giving it what it always wanted - more autonomy, especially in controlling its immigration.

(Answers at the foot of the page).Big Narstie, who began his chat show run by announcing: “First things first, I just want to say ‘Channel 4, you f***ed up’.”And he really wasn’t kidding.WANT to know what it’s like to be a cocker spaniel, locked in a Nissan Micra for two hours on Southend ­seafront? Try watching BBC2’s Stewart Lee: Content Provider, which was recorded live at the town’sPalace Theatre, in April. You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well.

In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities?

I had no idea the water was that bad.If wed known I never would have let Erin go swimming there.Signs warn people against going into the water at Wildersmouth Beach - but Paulina believes far more could be done.The signs should be made bigger and more obvious.When I posted something to Facebook about this, most of the comments were from people who also didnt realise you werent supposed to swim there - so it cant be that obvious.Erin certainly wont be going back in there again and I think its important to let as many people as possible know about it.I would hate for anyone else to go through this, it has been petrifying.Katy Nicholls, public protection manager for North Devon Council, said: “North Devon Council does not have any record of being notified about this incident by the child’s mother, nor have we received formal notification from any health body confirming a diagnosis of cryptosporidium.“We currently consider this to be an isolated incident, and in light of Wildersmouth Beach being an undesignated bathing beach we do not intend to take any further action.In the event that we should we receive any further reports of this kind we may look to liaise with other appropriate bodies, such as the Environment Agency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000326974450.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emmanuel macron invites theresa may for surprise visit to his cote dazur holiday fortress in fresh bid to keep brexit deal on track","story":"The PM has ripped up her final two days at Italy’s Lake Garda for a swiftly arranged summit at the French President’s holiday retreat this Friday.The move came as it emerged last night that France is refusing to budge on its hardline over Brexit, despite becoming ever more isolated among other EU states.Firmly backed by Paris, the EU’s chief negotiator and veteran French politician Michel Barnier sparked fresh turmoil by last week throwing out Mrs May’s compromise plan to collect EU customs tariffs.In a bid to step up the pressure, the Foreign Secretary told French officials yesterday that the EU boss is badly misjudging Britain’s pluck over the spiralling stand off.Jeremy Hunt insisted that the UK will not be bullied into submission by eurocrats’ hardline stance.On a visit to Paris, Mr Hunt said that unless Brussels softens its objections to Mrs May’s new softer Brexit plan agreed at Chequers, “there is real chance of No Deal by accident”.He also told the Evening Standard: “The probability of No Deal is increasing by the day.“The European Commission have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation.”Mr Hunt added in a tweet: “We need to work together to avoid a “no deal Brexit by accident” - it takes two to tango”.Mrs May will hold afternoon talks and then have dinner with Mr Macron and their partners at Fort Bregancon, his spectacular retreat on the French Riviera near Toulon.The trip is part of her summer-long bid to go above Mr Barnier’s head to win round the 27 EU leaders to her plan.Other member states have become exasperated by Paris constantly vetoing any compromises based on the UK’s proposals, The Sun has learned.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “Not every member state has the same position on everything, especially Brexit.“There’s one country that’s very hard on the British and that’s France. France is a little bit isolated in its opinion.“They’re the toughest but I don’t know why because the French have much more interest in Brexit than others.”In another blow for Mrs May, it also emerged yesterday that the EU’s declaration on its future trade and security relationship with Britain after Brexit may only be five pages long.Brussels officials said there is no time left to thrash out a fuller agreement and there is also scepticism that Mrs May will stay on in No10 long enough to deliver it.Brexiteer Tory MPs’ patience is wearing thin with the government’s big summer push to talk the EU round.Senior backbencher Nigel Evans tweeted: “Tip for our new Foreign Secretary- stop talking to Merkel, stop talking to Macron and start listening to the 17.4 million leave voters.“If we stitch them up over Brexit they will stitch us up at the next election.

A ministry spokesman would only say: “We will use the opportunity of Brexit to take back control of our borders and strengthen border security. We are considering a range of options for the future immigration system and will set out more details later this year.”We will need plenty of visible signs that we have left the EU, and this is one.While we’re at it, let’s get those Brexit stamps printed up for next March. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The government has suggested the need for this disruption is not part of its Brexit plans, and the UK\u0027s departure from the EU was not mentioned in the written statement announcing the plan or the consultation document.This does not appear to be correct, however.Local businesses have been told it will take up to two weeks to activate the plan, unlike the few minutes Operation Stack requires following news of disruption in Calais.The only plausible use for such a system is in anticipation of a structural increase in customs and regulatory checks at the UK border following Brexit in March next year.Kent County Council also point out in its report that \"Brock\" stands for \"Brexit Operations Across Kent\". Local industry sources claim privately that the government did not want its plans for a potential \"no deal\" Brexit associated with the need to turn a large swathe of the main motorway link with the Continent into a lorry park.The Dover document is especially important because the council is the Port Health Authority responsible for food safety checks required post-Brexit at the Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel.The report questions whether it is \"fully understood\" by central government that the Port Health Authority will not have powers \"to physically stop vehicles\" that officials \"in the large are blind as to what is entering the port\" the layout of the port means there is \"nothing to stop vehicles leaving\" Dover there are \"inadequate facilities to inspect and store food\" and \"no facilities to park vehicles waiting for examination\".Such checks have not occurred since 1992 at these sites and there is a shortage of vets to provide them.   The government hopes its Chequers plan for Brexit, including a common rulebook for goods and agri-food, will avoid the need to instigate new border checks.But they will be difficult to avoid in a no deal scenario, and the EU has vowed to enforce them even if - as Sky News reported earlier this year - the government\u0027s secret plan is to waive almost all such checks on goods coming in to the UK.The Dover report expresses some uncertainty about even in which country such checks will be required.It says: \"Current systems are based on juxtaposed controls being conducted in France and England... once outside the EU such [juxtaposed] controls may cease\".\"We cannot begin to surmise... the substantial workforce required to provide a service at the juxtaposed positions,\" it adds.The government was due to report in detail on its contingencies for a no deal Brexit in the following weeks."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-raiders-lost-ark-star-wars_4376470.jpg?20180731151102 ","title":"calling all film fans iconic outfits up for grabs","story":"The Prop Store items will be on show at London\u0027s BFI Imax from 6 September ahead of the 20 September auction."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-facebook-data-scandal_4273972.jpg?20180405140008 ","title":"facebook uncovers co ordinated campaign to sway upcoming us midterm elections","story":"Facebook said those behind the campaign had been \"more careful to cover their tracks\", adding: \"We\u0027ve found evidence of some connections between these accounts and IRA accounts we disabled last year (...) but there are differences too.\"The company said more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages, with the earliest having been created in March 2017.The most followed were \"Aztlan Warriors,\" \"Black Elevation\", \"Mindful Being\" and \"Resisters\".The Resisters page enlisted support from real followers for an August protest in Washington against the far-right \"Unite the Right\" group.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis.And she\u0027s not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year\u0027s series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show.American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: \"@LoveIsland Jack \u0026 Dani are goals! 😍 #LoveIsland\". There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they\u0027re not real, but it doesn\u0027t matter.\"Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl\u0027s mates.\"It\u0027s on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch. We\u0027re not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that\u0027s a distraction from real life.\"Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island\u0027s launch night viewers were aged 16-34.Only Britain\u0027s Got Talent - shown on ITV\u0027s main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show\u0027s success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: \"I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It\u0027s such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible.\"It\u0027s also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen.If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-alphabet-zoo-bradford_4377080.jpg?20180801003851 ","title":"major incident as man storms childrens play centre in bradford","story":"\"He jumped onto a group of people including myself but landed on his back after he had taken us down, so he was seriously injured.\"\"He was apprehended by police and staff who calmed him down.\"A spokesman said he could not confirm if there were any casualties during the incident at the Cemetery Road centre.A Facebook post from Alphabet Zoo said: \"Due to major incident, the Alphabet Zoo is currently closed, but we will re-open as soon as we can."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-burst-pipe-water-leak_4376960.jpg?20180731193640 ","title":"michael gove water companies must raise the bar on tackling leaks","story":"\"I have asked the companies I spoke to today to raise the bar on tackling leaks and agree ambitious new targets when they submit their business plans to Ofwat in September,\" Mr Gove said.\"The Government, Ofwat and customers expect water companies to improve their performance.\" He also said that \"we all have to deal\" and \"adapt\" as the consequences of climate change pose a challenge to the industry.The meeting was called following low levels in some reservoirs and the introduction of a hosepipe ban from 5 August.\"We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third.\"He admitted that there is \"more to do\" in terms of leakage issues, adding that companies are currently finalising plans to cut leakage \"by at least 15%\"."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-rihanna-vogue_4376998.jpg?20180731210454 ","title":"rihanna honoured to be on cover of british vogues prestigious september issue","story":"She sports pencil-thin eyebrows and a floral headpiece for the colourful cover, titled \"The Big Fashion Issue\".It marks Enninful\u0027s first September issue - widely regarded as the most important edition of the year - since he was named Alexandra Shulman\u0027s replacement last year.

The grim plan would dump 2,000 trucks on the coastbound carriageway of the M20 if customs chaos causes delays at ports in Kent. When Tory ministers unveiled the so-called interim plan in May, they didn\u0027t even mention Brexit - instead claiming it was to handle Channel disruption. But today it emerged the project\u0027s codename, Operation Brock, is short for... \u0027Brexit Operations Across Kent\u0027. And council papers claim that despite being an interim plan, it will last until 2023 at the earliest - the soonest a permanent replacement could be found. A report by Kent County Council warned: This risks damaging the country’s economy, and is even more alarming considering the imminent exit of the UK from the EU.  There is now and even more urgent need for Highways England to move forward with a serious and permanent alternative to Operation Stack. A report by Dover District Council, first obtained by Sky News, added: Operation Brock needs to be delivered before any possible change to customs arrangements in March 2019. But a start date for necessary road works has not yet been announced, and there does not appear to be a Plan B. Dover\u0027s report warns the M20, between junction 8 for Maidstone and 9 for Ashford, will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park costing \u0026pound25million under the plan, which is a replacement for the current Operation Stack. While 2,000 lorries sit motionless on one side of the six-lane motorway, both directions of traffic will squeeze into a contraflow on the other side. It is likely that a permanent solution will not be in place for many years, Dover\u0027s report adds - before demanding urgent clarity from the government.

Ahead of talks with his opposite numbers in France and Austria on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Foreign Secretary insisted that if Brussels fails to strike a withdrawal agreement with the UK it would cause job losses on both sides of the Channel if Brexit goes wrong. Mr Hunt accused the European Commission of waiting for Britain to blink in Brexit talks as he urged Paris and Berlin to put pressure on Brussels to cut a deal.  He told the London Evening Standard: The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation. There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could. France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.

It did not go well. This story all started last night, when a representative of the British Sandwich Association went on Newsnight. Jim Winship, a representative of the industry body, said it probably wouldn’t mean sandwiches dying out altogether. “But, he said: “Certainly there would be serious problems in terms of the fresh ingredients we bring in from the European Union and also from overseas, particularly if we have problems at ports and we can’t get ingredients through. “Because they’re all fresh and don’t have a very long shelf life. And we’ve got no chance of stockpiling fresh ingredients.  “So I think the answer from the sandwich industry is that it’s going to limited the amount of choice consumers have if we crash out of Brexit in the way that’s being talked about.”  In response, Peter Whittle - a Ukip member of the London assembly and former leadership contender - took to Twitter.    Clearly incredulous about Mr Winship\u0027s warning, he wrote: I\u0027ve taken a picture of my lunch for posterity, because like the dodo, this will soon be extinct. According to the nice man on the BBC. He added a crying emoji and a picture of his sandwich, lest we forget. There was just one problem with Whittle\u0027s bread-based protest. This was not his sandwich.    No, eagle-eyed Twitter users soon realised he had not taken out his phone and snapped his actual lunch, but appropriated it from the internet. The sandwich, a quick Google image search reveals, is a hearty country ham and apple sandwich, prepared by the Kraft food company for their KraftRecipes website.

The raiders struck at the 30-room mansion of biotech multi-millionaire Sir Christopher Evans OBE, and made off with \u0026pound1million worth of gems belonging to Lady Anne Evans. CCTV shows the gang brazenly strolling back and forth across the grounds of the Evans\u0027 mansion in broad daylight, carrying several basket-loads of their loot. It is thought that the four suspects scaled a seven-foot wall to gain entry to the grounds, whilst Lady Anne took her dog Scooter for a walk. Amongst the high-value jewellery and antiques taken from the mansion were four George III silver candlesticks, a gold and amethyst choker, and a late 19th century gold, diamond and sapphire tiara. Distraught Lady Anne also lost an 18-ct white gold diamond ring, an 18-ct yellow gold brooch set with four pearls, and a platinum and white gold diamond line Cartier bracelet in the raid.   Swimmer\u0027s arm severed and another\u0027s leg amputated after they are hit by speedboat propeller in Majorca  And three Art Nouveau silver rose bowls were also taken, dating back to 1901, and with the embossed inscription Flowers are the playthings fair left by angels long ago. The jewellery and antiques had an estimated value in excess of one million pounds, and it is believed the offenders made off in a grey or silver Audi S5, headed in the direction of Cirencester. Gloucestershire Police are now investigating the theft, which took place on July 9 between 5pm and 8pm at Glebe House in the quiet village of Bibury, Glos. Sir Christopher, an internationally renowned life sciences entrepreneur who is worth \u0026pound158million, has spoken of the audacity of the burglars. He said: On behalf of my family I am offering a substantial reward for information that will lead to the conviction of these thieves. It is a sign of the times that people have the audacity to scale a perimeter wall in broad daylight and walk across open grounds to steal from someone\u0027s home. We\u0027ve lived in Bibury for many years and have never encountered anything like this before.   Man legally changes gender \u0027so he can get cheaper car insurance as woman\u0027  Of course, there is always a financial loss when something happens like this, but the real pain comes from what these stolen items mean and symbolise in our lives. The burglary has had a particularly devastating effect on my wife Anne as many of the pieces of jewellery, silver and ceramics have huge sentimental value for us both. For example, Anne\u0027s engagement ring, her late father\u0027s signet ring - the only thing she has left of him. Then there is an irreplaceable rose Ramsden and Carr rose bowl - dated London 1901 - and a diamond ring I bought my wife when our first child was born - which cost almost our entire savings at that point. There are many small value and large items that have been stolen but they all have the same emotional and sentimental impact. Detective Constable Faye Satchwell-Bennett, who is investigating the burglary, added: We are trying to identify the offenders and ask that members of the public watch the CCTV footage and think back to that day. Do you know who these people are? Did you see a silver or grey vehicle driving at speed through Bibury between these times or anything suspicious that may help with our investigation? As with any other burglary this has had a marked impact on the victims.

Carmie, who lives in Surrey and blogs under the name Touchdalight , then adds water and climbs in bit by bit, finishing by dunking his face in the liquid.  Some fans have said the video is fake, but people are saying it is still irresponsible to share it.  Many are concerned it will inspire other young people to copy his idea and some fear it might start the latest dangerous internet trend. The video, which has been viewed more than 1.8million times, was shared with the caption: This is the dumbest s*** I ever done. The video starts with him walking around a shop with a basket buying the bleach, before cutting to a bathroom where he fills the bath tub with five bottles of the liquid. He then adds water and puts his hand in to see what it\u0027s like.  When he pulls his hand out it looks bright red, with sections of skin peeling off. He then climbs into the tub and covers his body in the liquid, while continuing to speak to the camera and saying repeatedly how much it hurts. Finally, he gets on his knees and dips his face into the water and holds it for several seconds.

Husband Stewart Rawnsley told the hearing that his wife lay bleeding from every orifice in a hospital bed as his insurance company insisted she should not be moved to the mainland. Westminster Coroner\u0027s Court heard that Natalie, from Harpenden, Hertfordshire, rapidly deteriorated in just 36 hours after consuming the chicken at a hotel restaurant. She died after blood clots formed all over her body and blocked the vessels last August. Her devastated twin sister Michelle Martin, 38, posted a heartbreaking tribute to Natalie following her death, reports The Sun.   Sharing a picture on Facebook of the two of them smiling, she wrote: My baby, my soul Mate, best big sister, best godmother, best aunty, best daughter, best wife and above all the best mother to my beautiful nephews.  Natalie was just beginning the second week of her trip with husband Stewart and two young sons when tragedy struck. Stuart said his wife had complained that evening of feeling unwell, but had not said anything specific about how she felt ill. He was woken at 3am when Natalie started throwing up in the hotel bathroom. A doctor came the next day and diagnosed Natalie with gastroenteritis - he then told Stewart and the children to leave her bedside to prevent them from catching the illness.  Stewart was later told by text message that Natalie had been moved from the medical centre to Corfu hospital in the early evening. Stewart said: The hospital was on the other side of the island about 70km away from my memory. The A\u0026ampE department was empty. My wife was down the end of the room surrounded by about eight people. She was fully awake and aware, and happy to see me, but obviously distressed and concerned. There was pain in her legs and she had also had a number of red blotches all over her. The inquest heard that a nurse, who said she was the head of international medicine, said they wanted to fly Natalie to a hospital on the mainland, which had better facilities. However Natalie\u0027s condition quickly deteriorated as her family members, including her brother and niece, gathered by her bedside.

And all despite being just 5ft 1in with rheumatoid arthritis and a knee replacement.  Seven-stone former soldier Ede started the martial art five years ago after her grandson took her to a training session at his school. She took to it like a duck to water and she is close to becoming a black belt. Ede said: “I like karate because it proves to me that I’m capable of doing things that I didn’t think I would be able to do.  “It keeps you mentally alert, as you have to know when the next punch is coming.

Medical student Anna Stevens and biochemistry graduate Kathryn Coulson, both 21, were on top of Mount Rinjani when the 6.4 tremor struck on Sunday, killing at least 16 people on the island .  They were at the summit when the quake began and were told by tour guides to run to the centre of the volcano and shelter behind a rock as boulders flew past them. Miss Stevens, from Neasham, and Miss Coulson, from Middleton St George, near Darlington, Co Durham, were stuck on the volcano until Monday because many of the trails and bridges had been destroyed and they were among hundreds of tourists trapped there overnight.  Their families faced an anxious wait until the British Embassy traced the former Hurworth School pupils. The women eventually managed to get into an area for a mobile phone signal to call their loved ones. Miss Coulson’s aunt Victoria Toas said: “They actually believed the volcano was erupting until they spoke to us and we told them it was an earthquake. “They were absolutely terrified. There were boulders flying past them and then there were aftershocks.”  She said they had learned there had been looting in following the earthquake and there were concerns that the pair may not have passports to leave the island. But later, she added: “I have just spoken to Kathryn and they have located their passports and luggage and are heading to the port. So thankfully all is well.” The students saw an army truck heading up the mountain to collect bodies as they descended, so it was feared the official death toll may increase.  The earthquake early on Sunday killed 16 people, including an Indonesian student who was among the Mount Rinjani climbers. The shallow quake set off landslides on the rocky mountainside, blocking the normal pathways out. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency had said more than 680 people were stranded on Rinjani, based on figures from its entry gates where visitors are registered. Most are foreign - from 26 countries - including more than 330 from Thailand.  The Foreign office said last night that six Britons who registered to climb the mountain confirmed to officials that they had made their way safely to its base – but others may have gone unreported. More than 1,400 homes were damaged on the island after the tremors struck from a shallow depth, which tends to inflict greater devastation. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency has recorded more than 270 aftershocks. President Joko Widodo said the government would give each family whose home was destroyed 50 million rupiah (\u0026pound2,670) to rebuild.

A poll of 2,000 Brits saw nearly three in 10 select the Monty Python legend as the best export from the northern region. Second on the list was gruff actor Sean Bean, followed by Sir Patrick Stewart. Halifax-born Ed Sheeran came fourth with Jeremy Clarkson rounding out the top five.  Dame Judi Dench was chosen by almost half of respondents as the greatest ever Yorkshirewoman, followed by Jess Ennis-Hill and the Bront\u0026euml sisters. The study was conducted by the energy supplier npower to celebrate Yorkshire Day on August 1st. Commercial Director at npower and proud Yorkshireman, Andy Wiggans, said: “Yorkshire Day is a reason to celebrate everything brilliant about the UK’s biggest county, and there’s no shortage of legendary Yorkshire folk to pick from with a list like this. “We wanted to give the nation the chance to think about the region and how much it’s given the country – and the rest of the world. “After all, where would we be without Monty Python’s dead parrot sketch – inspired by Michael Palin’s disastrous trip to a mechanic, who refused to accept there was something wrong with his car?” When asked to think about Yorkshire, the first thing that springs to mind for Brits is Yorkshire pudding, with one in five saying the Sunday roast staple is the single best thing to have originated from the region.  A further 14 per cent believe the ‘catseye’ reflective road stud is Yorkshire’s greatest export while one in 10 selected the creation of the world’s first commercial steam locomotive, which was built in Holbeck by engineer Matthew Murray in 1812. It also emerged two thirds of the country have either visited Yorkshire or lived there are some point in their lives, with 34 per cent still to visit. And a tenth of respondents loved their time there so much they’d consider making the move permanently. This could be due to the lilting accent, which 45 per cent of Brits say they’re happy to hear. However, an incredible one in eight Brits admit they’d struggle to locate Yorkshire on a map of the UK.  Researchers also found Yorkshire’s reputation for being careful with money is well-founded, with a tenth of Brits believing people from the county are better at looking after the pennies than those from elsewhere. And twice as many people think those from Yorkshire are more likely to be careful when it comes to saving energy than anywhere else in the UK. Andy added: “Whether you’ve been once, twice or lived there for years, it’s great to see how much the area has contributed to society. “We’ve generated some of the most famous names throughout history – and it’s exciting to wonder who the next will be.”  THE TOP 10 BEST EVER YORKSHIREMEN  1.

Monday night\u0027s episode featured a recipe for carrot cake pakoras - a unique twist on an Indian dish.  The chef showed food fans how to make a batch of the deep fried spiced cakes, which are served with a cream cheese dip. A pakora is traditionally a savoury fritter, but Nadiya says she was inspired to combine it with cake as part of a crazy middle-of-the-night idea. She explained: People deep fry chocolate bars so why not deep fry cake batter? She added that it was a great way to use up any leftover carrots you have around the house.  People on Twitter went wild for her quirky creation, with people even going as far as to demand the Queen make her a dame for the invention. One person said: Carrot cake pakoras??? Nadiya is a GENIUS omg they looked delicious. Another wrote: I\u0027m not going to sleep tonight thinking of Nadiya\u0027s carrot cake pakoras.    Unladylike drooling here watching those amazing fried carrot cakes, added a third. Nadiya is making FRIED CAKES. Make her a dame now, your majesty, said a fourth. Nadiya revealed where her idea for the unique dish came from during the episode.

Researchers polling 1,000 kids aged six to 12 found many are clueless about where their fruit really comes from. So much so, half of kids don\u0027t know that blackcurrants grow on bushes and a further six in 10 were unaware grapes sprout on vines. Eight in 10 kids even believe bananas grow on trees rather than on plants.  In response to the findings, author and TV personality Katie Piper has teamed up with organic fruit drink Honest Kids to invite a group of children to spend a day on a real fruit farm.  Swapping their trainers for wellies for the very first time, the city kids got to grip with how apples, grapes and berries are grown.  Mother of two Katie Piper said: “I’m really excited to be working with Honest kids to encourage more families to get outdoors this summer, visit their local pick-your-own fruit farms and learn more about how fruit is grown. “A pick-your-own fruit picnic is a great summer activity to do together as a family and a fun way to re-engage with nature whilst also learning a little more about where our food comes from.” The study found four in 10 baffled little Brits think cherries originate from bushes, vines or plants, while 14 per cent think melons grow under the ground. More than nine in 10 kids have no idea how strawberries or cranberries are grown.  Just under half of those polled were confused about where plums came from, 53 per cent don’t know how apricots are grown and 88 per cent are baffled about the origin of pineapples. Researchers also found the average British child eats up to 10 pieces of fruit a week, with bananas the top choice (32 per cent), followed by grapes (28 per cent), apples (25 per cent), mangoes and pineapples (13 per cent). But despite a relatively healthy consumption of fruit, even by their teenage years, some children don’t have a clear understanding of where it grows. It also emerged three in 10 kids have never picked their own fruit before and three in four haven’t ever visited an orchard. However, four in 10 do want to visit a fruit farm this summer to learn more. Brand ambassador Katie Piper will be appearing with Honest Kids at the GO! Organic festival on the 8th September in Battersea Park, London. She added: “It’s really refreshing as a busy mother of two to find a product like Honest kids which is so simply made with just water and organic fruit juice – perfect for on-the-go refreshments during the hectic summer months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paddy dohertys nephew mikey connors","story":"Mikey Connors, in his 30s, was today remembered as a ÒloyalÓ family man after the fatal crash unfolded in southeast London on Saturday morning.\" content=\"https://i2-prod.mirror/incoming/article13010358.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/3_Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-160046.jpg\"/Mikey Connors died following a collision after a fatal crash on Saturday morningGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBig Fat Gypsy Wedding\u0027s Paddy Doherty is going through another tragic loss in his family after his nephew was killed in a horse and cart crash. Mikey Connors - described as a loyal family man - died following a collision on Eastern Way, Thamesmead on Saturday morning. The 30-year-old was horse racing when the incident happened.  When he did not cross the finishing line, concerned family and friends went back to look for him and made the tragic discovery. The death will come as a devastating blow to Mikey\u0027s uncle Paddy, who has lost several family members in just over a year. Doherty laid his mother to rest in April after revealing she died of a broken heart - following the death of her beloved husband.  Known as Queenie, Elizabeth Doherty suffered a massive heart attack just days after a headstone was placed on the grave of her much-loved spouse, Simon. Simon, known as Simey, died a year earlier after battling an illness and his funeral drew hundreds of mourners as he was remembered and celebrated as the father of all travellers. And in October 2017, the teenage nephew of the Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star tragically died in a car crash. Tom \u0027Tomboy\u0027 Doherty was only 17-years-old when he was killed following a collision in South Nutfield.  Since Mikey\u0027s death yesterday, Paddy\u0027s wife Roseanne paid tribute to him and said that everyone is in shock. Family and friends have since paid tribute to the dad on social media. Brother Simey Connors wrote: “I promised you (to) stay strong Mikey. “It’s getting harder already you don’t understand how much I miss you brother.”  Another friend added: Such a huge loss and all we can live for is memories and remember the smiles he gave everyone. Met Police have confirmed that they are investigating the tragedy and a 30-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving.

Martin Fitzgerald, of Manchester, Josh Ekim, 26, of London, and Daley Thompson, 27, of Cardiff faced prison sentences on their respective tripes in Thailand, Greece and Spain after getting into trouble from police abroad. Father-of-one Mr Thompson could have spent 15 years in a Greek prison after him and two of his friends were discovered with \u0026pound8,000 of cocaine in party island Malia, on the island of Crete, two years ago. After his first night on a stag do in Ibiza, Mr Fitzgerald was also arrested and falsely accused of assaulting a police officer after the group were involved in a fight with a group of revellers at the Spanish party hotspot.  Meanwhile Mr Ekim had to pay \u0026pound1,500 to Thai police in Phuket after crashing into another moped following an alcohol-fuelled night with his friends. Each of their experiences are told in a four-part 5Star series called Young, Dumb, and Banged Up in the Sun. This features young Britons who have been put behind bars abroad while on holiday or living as expats. Stories include a mix of those who are guilty as well as those who are innocent, including one who was falsely accused of murder. They include those who are guilty, and others imprisoned for crimes they didn’t commit - including one falsely accused of murder. Here, ahead of the first episode on Wednesday night, here are the stories of Martin Fitzgerald, Josh Ekim and Daley Thompson.  Daley Thompson, 26, Cardiff  Location: Malia, Greece Why he was arrested: Accused of possessing, smuggling and dealing cocaine  In the summer of 2016, Thompson along with his friends Kyle and Joel went on holiday to Malia in Crete. He said: We had a ball, we went out partying, we had a laugh dancing with the girls, the usual stuff. They had met a group of English men earlier on in their trip who had cocaine and offered to introduce them to their dealer an \u0027Albanian man down the strip\u0027. After meeting the dealers the following day, they purchased four-and-a-half ounces of the Class A drug but because it was more expensive in smaller amounts they bought it in bulk. While they did not intend to sell it themselves, Thompson and his friends began making double the street value, which in Malia is \u0026pound80 per gram. He said: They would rather buy from us rather than go to the Albanian guys. We were just having a laugh until the fifth day, everything went wrong.  After a drug-fuelled night police raided their flat and found more than \u0026pound8,000 of cocaine in the apartment fridge. The three were taken to Neapolis jail, where they got caught in the middle of a gang war between Greek and Albanian prisoners, before Thompson was transferred to the notorious Alikarnassos prison following an altercation in his cell. He kept to himself while he was surrounded by dangerous prisoners including Mexican drug cartels, Pakistani drug bosses, and the Chinese Mafia who were chopping people\u0027s body parts off. The group admitted possession but denied charges of supplying and smuggling. The minimum sentence for smuggling is 15 years. Following an eight month stint in prison, Thompson was found guilty of possession and selling the drug but not smuggling. They were all sentenced to four years in jail with a three-year suspended sentence but as they had already served nearly a year they were released straight away. Thompson said: I missed my son\u0027s birthday... I lost my girlfriend, I lost everything,\u0027 I know I was having fun for the first five days but look where I am. It was disgusting. It was like a hellhole in there.  Martin Fitzgerald, Manchester  Location: Ibiza, Spain Why he was arrested: Accused of assaulting a police officer  Along with ten of his friends, Mr Fitzgerald travelled to Ibiza for a stag do for the first wedding of all of their friends. Following hours of heavy drinking on the first night, the group headed to party hot spot of San Antonio but became involved in an altercation outside a nightclub two Spanish partygoers are said to have drawn a knife inside. After his friends moved onto the next bar, Fitzgerald stayed but was eventually identified by police as a suspect. He said: I went over to the police officers to put the story straight. As soon as I went over to introduce myself, they got a grip on my arm. After breaking free from the officer\u0027s grasp, he ran through the streets before being arrested in another bar. Mr Fitzgerald was then moved to San Antonio police station, where he was accused of assaulting the police officer who had chased him which could see him face a year in prison. He came before a judge three years later who offered him a deal in exchange for a guilty plea to the assault charge. His 12-month prison term was then reduced to a suspended sentence, and he was immediately released. Fitzgerald said:  I gave a big sigh of relief. I went to the British Consulate and they advised me to stay in the room and get the flight home the next day.

It came just weeks after the birth of Prince Louis on April 23 - prompting many royal fans to believe it was a \u0027push present\u0027 from Prince William .  And it wouldn\u0027t be something out of the ordinary, as the Duke of Cambridge had previously gifted Kate jewellery following the births of Charlotte and George as a token of his appreciation.  He reportedly gave Kate a pair of green tourmaline, green amethyst and diamond earrings, worth around \u0026pound3,000, when Princess Charlotte was born in May 2015.    And it is also thought William gave Kate a circular pendant inscribed with ‘George Alexander Louis’ following the birth of her first child, Prince George .   So many fans were delighted when they saw the citrine ring on Kate\u0027s right hand in May at the royal wedding. She also wore it while at this year\u0027s Wimbledon with a lemon-coloured dress .  However, if William did indeed give Kate a gift following the birth of Louis, it was not the citrine ring as it has now emerged she was seen wearing the same sparkler 10 years ago. Eagled-eyed fans have spotted that Kate wore the ring at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman in July 2008.  The Duchess of Cambridge was also photographed wearing the sparkler back in January 2008 when she celebrated her 26th birthday. She was snapped leaving Kitts club in Sloane Square with younger sister Pippa Middleton.  Meanwhile, push presents appear to be a tradition within the royal family , Prince Philip reportedly gave the Queen a large bottle of champagne and bouquet of red roses and carnations following the birth of Prince Charles in 1948.  But it was Princess Diana who is said to have been spoiled the most as she was lavished with a range of gifts, including a diamond and pearl necklace that featured a dazzling heart at the centre, a gold ‘W’ to add to her charm bracelet and a custom Mini Cooper.

Jennifer Ashwood gave birth to her one-in-500million twins Poppy and Piran House by c-section just months after discovering she had a rare \u0027heart shaped\u0027 uterus. The 31-year-old said her body has surprised her as there was no indication she had two wombs when she gave birth to her first child Millie, now eight. Doctors told her it was so rare to carry a baby in each one, they didn\u0027t quite know what was going to happen until they opened her up. Remarkably, she became pregnant with twins when one egg was released into each uterus - and they were both successfully fertilised at the same time.  Doctors told Jennifer and partner Andrew House the chances of having twins in this way was one-in-500 million. The family are now all home in Camborne, Cornwall, and getting to grips with their two new members. Jennifer, a care coordinator, said: To have the two uterus\u0027 is rare in itself, but to have an egg in both, then those to be fertilised, and then for both eggs to be in the right part, it\u0027s a bit of a miracle. It is ridiculously rare. The odds were stacked against us but it all worked out. You think that you know your body well, but it turns out you might not. I\u0027m 31. I\u0027ve had a baby before and it was really straight forward. But my body has surprised me this time.  It\u0027s two separate uterine cavities joined by one cervix. Everything else is the same, with two fallopian tubes, one each side, each with an ovary. It\u0027s caused by a mid-line abnormality from when I was in the womb. What happened was at the time of ovulation an egg was released from each tube, one into each uterus, and both were fertilised, and both remained in each uterus. It\u0027s crazy when you think about it. It\u0027s possible that the fertilisation could have occurred one or even two days apart, but it was from the same time. We found out at the 20 week scan and ever since people have been saying how rare it was.  Jennifer and Andrew, a firefighter, found out they were expecting twins in December 2017, at their dating scan, and he proposed on New Years\u0027 Eve. In January 2018 they found out she had a uterine abnormality, and doctors revealed in February she had a complete bicornuate uterus with a baby in each side. A bicornuate womb is heart-shaped and women have no extra difficulties with conception, but there is a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. In most cases women with the condition will only carry one baby in one uterus. Jennifer went into early labour at 28 weeks, but her contractions were stopped with medicine, and she had a c-section on May 6.  Piran was born first at 5lb 10oz, with Poppy born minutes later weighing 5lb 3oz. Doctors even took a photo of Jennifer\u0027s uterus\u0027 during surgery at her request, so she could see what it looked like. It clearly shows the two uterus\u0027 with one measuring much smaller than the other. They had their own uterus, their own amniotic sacks, and their own placentas, she said. They said it was realistically like having two single pregnancies at the same time. It\u0027s hard to compare this pregnancy to my last one. Definitely compared to my first pregnancy I was sick much, much more. Because it\u0027s so rare to carry a baby in each one, they didn\u0027t really quite know what was going to happen until they opened me up and took a look.

Claire Joanne Wright was found dead at Heron’s Lake Retreat in Caerwys, North Wales on July 16 at 12:50pm. The death of the cafe manager, from Bradford, remains unexplained as police wait for results from her post mortem. At the opening of her inquest at County Hall in Ruthin, coroner John Gittins said he could not give too much information about the 38-year-old’s death due to an ongoing police investigation.  “This death is the subject of an inquiry by North Wales Police,” he said. “Due to the circumstances, I’m not in a position to give a great deal of information regarding the circumstances in how Ms Wright was found deceased.” Mr Gittins opened the inquest but immediately adjourned it, pending the outcome of the police investigation, reports the Daily Post. He added: “I do have a responsibility in law to open my inquest as soon as possible and I’ve had adequate information regarding identification to facilitate that.  “So I now open that inquest but, because there are ongoing police investigations, it’s not clear whether any charges will arise in relation to the death of Ms Wright. “Therefore it’s not appropriate to give a final inquest date at this time. So for the time being, I’m opening and adjourning the inquest.” North Wales Police said they are awaiting the results of tests in regard to the post mortem, which could still take several weeks to come through. A spokesman said: “The results of a HM post mortem examination have proved inconclusive and further tests are being carried out.

When it comes to the big O, there\u0027s lots that still remains a mystery - scientists are still perplexed by aspects of the the female orgasm, for example. What we do know is that orgasms are seriously beneficial for our physical and mental wellbeing - but there\u0027s much more to them than that. Here\u0027s five mind-blowing orgasm facts that will pique your interest on National Orgasm Day.  1. The longest orgasm  When it comes to orgasm length, women\u0027s are on average longer than men\u0027s. Most say it lasts around 10 seconds, whereas for men it\u0027s more like eight . However, for a lucky minority of women, it\u0027s possible to orgasm up to 20 times in one steamy sesh.   In 2012, the longest ever recorded masturbatory session was recorded by porn star Sonny Nah who pleasured himself for 10 hours and 10 minutes before he ejaculated - according to AOL .   2. They can happen when you given birth We normally associate orgasms with sex, but they can actually happen without any sexual stimulation at all.  There are instances of people having orgasms riding horses, during workouts and even during childbirth - this is known as a birthgasm , which some women find is an excellent pain reliever once they\u0027ve gone in to labour.  3. People can suffer from constant orgasms  Persistent genital arousal syndrome is a rare condition where people feel like they are on the verge of orgasm almost constantly - and can have around a hundred per day .   It might sound like it would be fun, but it\u0027s exhausting and many sufferers struggle to alleviate symptoms which can include swelling and pain.

Bruce Beach, 83, began constructing the 10,000 sq ft Ark Two shelter in the early 1980s during the height of the Cold War. It\u0027s thought to be the largest nuclear fallout shelter in North America. But he keeps the mammoth shelter running with help from volunteers should the world erupt into nuclear war. The self-confessed \u0027survivalist\u0027 says he fully expects the world to descend into nuclear war and is surprised it hasn\u0027t happened in the decades he has been preparing his mega bunker.  Well, I\u0027ve thought for years this is it. he told the BBC .  They (world leaders) can\u0027t get any worse than this but they do. He has appeared on the 2012 Netflix documentary \u0027Doomsday Preppers\u0027 where he talks through his plans should the world end and how he has prepared for various catastrophic scenarios.  The heavily fortified network of buses, encased in concrete and buried 14 ft below the ground, can accommodate as many as 500 people for up to three weeks - enough time for nuclear fallout to decay to a safe level. According to Bruce, the layers of earth over the shelter complex should be enough to keep people safe from the effects of radiation. The bunker is powered by diesel generators, has two kitchens, full plumbing, a day room, space to store weapons, a decontamination tank, a chapel, a radio communications center and a 5,000 gallon water tank. According to reports Bruce has claimed the shelter could also work as an \u0027underground orphanage\u0027. He has previously reportedly said he would prefer to allow children into the bunker than adults as they are the future of civilisation. The kids quarters can sleep 96 children in two shifts.

Experts have named the mineral \u0027uakitite\u0027, saying it was formed in space. Boris Shustov, head of the Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Science said: This is a fairly common phenomenon due to the fact that a number of minerals, number of substances that can be formed and are formed under cosmic conditions, are not found on Earth. But also visa versa - not all the terrestrial substances are found in those meteorites.  The discovery was unveiled by researchers from the Ural Federal University, Novosibirsk State University and the Geological Institute at the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science.

As soon as my dad walked in, I just felt like I was going to burst into tears at any point.“I had to have a tissue in my hand when I got married just in case.“I am not usually emotional but that day I just kept on crying.”Waiting at West Park Hotel was Lewis with best man Ryan Bruce and ushers James Simpson, Gavin Smith and Euan McCafferty and Lisa’s nephews Ellis and Luis Mordente who were an usher and page boy respectively.By her dad’s side, Lisa was piped down the aisle to the tune of Highland Cathedral.It’s not unusual for Godfrey to be seen at weddings as he is a well-known Dundee photographer.Lisa said: “It was amazing having my dad walk me down the aisle and then he became the photographer for the day too.“Because my dad has been doing wedding photography for so long he knew a contact for every part of our big day so that made it a bit easier.“All of the suppliers were amazing and I can’t thank them enough for helping put our wedding together.”After, the pair, who live near Tannadice Park, said “I do” the evening reception got into full swing.Local band Pepper Pot got everyone up on the dance floor, which is exactly what the bride had dreamed of.“I didn’t want a boring wedding – I wanted everyone to get up and have a good time,” she said.“I first saw the band at my sixth year dance and always said I wanted them to play at my wedding as they were such good fun. Luckily, my dad knew them too.“They played our first dance song Somewhere Over the Rainbow on a ukelele, which was lovely.“Ever since, people have been telling us that it was the best wedding they have ever been to and I have to agree.“I wouldn’t change a thing about the day – it went absolutely perfectly.“I am so happy to be married and want to thank everyone for all they did to make our wedding the best day ever.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b5b4652e80e1.jpg ","title":"dundee people every dog has its dayat errol show","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPooches put their best paws forward at the Errol Dog Show, held in glorious sunshine.Breeds including Irish wolfhounds, greyhounds and rottweilers were strutting their stuff with their owners as part of the event.The animals proved that every dog does indeed have its day as they enjoyed an array of activities in the summer sun.Some of them glammed up to stand out from the crowd, with a plethora of extravagant accessories on show.Despite pets coming in all shapes and sizes, the event went off without a hitch, attracting people from Dundee, Perthshire and Fife.Pictured are an array of dogs who weren’t afraid of “puperazzi” attention.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Nottingham-British-Finals-2018-Gold-2-x-silver-and-a-Bronze.jpg ","title":"dundee people gymnasts take a successful tumble","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA number of local gymnasts enjoyed success at the NDP British Championships in Nottingham.Five members of Dundee Gymnastics Club 2K travelled to the championships which saw them tumbling down a 25-metre track giving a display of back flips, somersaults and other gravity-defying skills.Earlier last month saw seven of the clubs tumble squad head to Birmingham to represent Scotland in the NDP British semi-finals.Five of these gymnasts qualified, for of those returning with medals.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it.

He missed the penalty at Ross County and for this reason he talked to Adam and said ‘you take it’!“Nicky is a player sometimes you don’t see anything from for 90 minutes and then he’s there to score a goal, this is his strength.“His two goals definitely gives us hope for the league ahead.”That was Clark’s second and third goal in his first four games for the Tangerines.With 29 goals in 62 Championship games for previous club Dunfermline, United are hoping he can fire them to promotion this season.Another bright spot for the campaign ahead is youngster Declan Glass. The 18-year-old made his mark in the north, despite only replacing Clark for the final eight minutes.With the final move of the game, Glass jinked past his man on the edge of the area and smashed the goal beyond Kyle Gourlay, the Elgin goalkeeper on loan from Dundee.And Csaba says knocking in four goals sets his side up for next week’s league opener against the Pars.He added: “It was important we scored goals.“In the first half we tried but we had just two or three possibilities but we missed and I think the second half was OK, we used the possibilities to score.“It’s always the same against teams who are in a lower league, they defend very well and stay very deep.“I said in the dressing-room keep your patience, keep going, keep going and be more accurate in front of goal.“It was good, I am really satisfied.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures dundee united take on 100 young arabs at open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United players took on 100 young Arabs at Tannadice yesterday with many more fans getting a chance to meet the players.The Tangerines held their annual open day giving supporters the chance to meet the squad aiming to get their side back in to the Premiership."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"adorable-ferret-found-abandoned-in-box-in-motherwell","story":"                          THE Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after an adorable ferret was found in the middle of a road."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-left-trapped-in-their-homes-due-to-glasgow-2018-road-closures","story":"                          RESIDENTS claim they will left trapped in their homes as hundreds of major roads are closed for the upcoming European Championship Games."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-confirmed-as-partner-club-for-pes-2019","story":"                          A Celtic-themed limited edition of PES 2019 is set for release after the Scottish champions were confirmed as a partner club for the forthcoming video game.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"busy-city-centre-roads-to-close-for-patching-works","story":"                          BUSY city centre streets will be closed tonight for carriageway repairs."},{"url":null,"title":"durex-urgently-recalls-several-batches-of-condoms","story":"                          Condom manufacturer Durex has recalled certain batches of its Real Feel and latex-free condoms over fears they could split."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-apologises-to-glasgows-equal-pay-women-but-critics-want-action-not-words","story":"                          A SENIOR Labour official has apologised to Glasgow\u0027s ripped off equal pay women in a first during the 10-year fight."},{"url":null,"title":"major-retailer-to-move-into-glasgow-fort-next-month-creating-35-jobs","story":"                          DISCOUNT retailer B\u0026ampM will open a new store in a major shopping centre creating around 35 jobs."},{"url":null,"title":"former-casualty-actor-richard-winsor-to-play-lead-in-kings-theatre-production-of-saturday-night-fever","story":"                          A FORMER Casualty actor will take on the lead role in the King\u0027s Theatre production of Saturday Night Fever this November."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-european-championship-guests-to-live-like-locals-as-event-teams-up-with-airbnb","story":"                          Hundreds of visitors heading to Glasgow for the European Championships 2018 will be living like locals."},{"url":null,"title":"sponsored-content-sample-quality-dining-throughout-glasgow-and-the-west","story":"                          FINDING authentic meals that are not only delicious but also reasonably priced can often involve a good deal of trial and error.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete

keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate

That’s when I noticed there was a wire hanging out of the casing and I realised he must have had a bit of a shock.“He’s okay now – he was neutered last week and I thought a stitch had burst afterwards so I took him back to the vet, but he’s all right, just not himself.”Kerry, who works as a counter assistant in a fish and chip shop, reported the fault to the council on Tuesday.She said: “I walk my dogs three times a day mostly around Hayton Road, sometimes I go down to the Donside.“When I walked Jake the next day he went back to the same lamp-post and tried to do it again.“I had hoped it would be fixed sooner than it was.“The situation could have been a lot worse than it was – it could have even been a child injured if they grabbed hold of it.”Area councillor Ross Grant said: “I want to

north-east towns to make it easier for children to move around.East Garioch Councillor Glen Reid is looking for a route to be made from Blackburn and Kintore to Kemnay.The SNP politician argued it will give children more opportunity to move between the towns safely and without being driven by parents.His call comes after the recent opening of the Inverurie to Kintore cycle path linking the two towns.Plans are in place to link Blackburn to Kintore, but Mr Reid is hoping to create a wider cycle network, taking in more of Garioch.He has welcomed the opening of the Kintore to Inverurie route. He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"surgerys bid to get active","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen medical practice hopes to prescribe active lifestyles to its patients by becoming the first in the north-east to be named an official Parkrun practice.Danestone Medical Practice was awarded the title after practice manager Tracey Thom used the weekly 5km runs to lose more than five stone in weight.She is now hoping to promote the health benefits of Parkrun to the patients at Danestone and has applied to have the practice recognised by the Royal College of General Practitioners as NHS Grampian’s first official Parkrun practice.Tracey said: “Parkrun has changed my life for the better.“People may think that those who work in medical practices would be the best at staying fit and active but before I started taking part in the weekly runs along the beach every Saturday I was doing no exercise what so ever and my diet was shocking.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters week 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 16/06/18, 5:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe Now[Usual Science Matters logo]The battle for survival between native red and invasive grey squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

appropriately","story":"NewsAyrshire motorists urged to park appropriately at Ayr and Crosshouse HospitalsDrivers warned to keep grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staffShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:00, 29 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth bosses were this week urging motorists to park ‘appropriately’ after complaints about parking chaos at Ayr Hospital. NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"health inspectors found heavily contaminated","story":"NewsHealth inspectors have found “heavily contaminated” equipment in Ayrshire’s maternity theatreProbe uncovered suspected blood contamination at hospitalShare\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson07:00, 31 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth inspectors have found “heavily contaminated” equipment in Ayrshire’s maternity theatre. A probe also uncovered suspected blood contamination on the shoes of staff at Crosshouse Hospital. The shock investigation, carried out by Healthcare Improvement Scotland in May, included A and E, the maternity inpatient ward and theatre department, and the medical high dependency unit. Examiners said they “observed good compliance with hand hygiene”. “This included medical, nursing and domestic staff,” they added. But the report said that maternity theatre staff “appeared confused” about infection prevention and control audits, which was raised with senior managers. Concerns were also raised regarding suspected blood found on staff’s shoes and contaminated equipment in the maternity theatre and changing rooms. It comes just 12 months after a government-commissioned report into the “unnecessary” deaths of six babies at the hospital which criticised staff shortages. The latest hygiene report stated: “We were told it is the responsibility of each member of staff to clean these, however, it was recognised this had been difficult to implement with some staff groups. “In the maternity theatres, two positional pieces were heavily contaminated on the inside covers. “This equipment is used to provide support and stability to patients during their procedures. “We were told these were removed immediately and replacements were ordered.” Inspectors said they were aware of “good segregation of domestic and clinical waste”. But their report added: “In the maternity theatres, clinical waste was not stored locked awaiting uplift. “We also identified a similar issue in the wards. This could allow unauthorised access to clinical waste.” Alastair Delaney, from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: “A good standard of cleaning was found generally and it was noted that considerable improvements have been made to cleanliness of equipment in the emergency department since our last inspection. “However, to improve care, NHS Ayrshire and Arran should ensure theatre departments are maintained so they can be effectively cleaned to provide a safe environment for patients.” Hazel Borland, nurse director for the health board, said: “We fully accept these findings. “The HEI inspection was valuable in helping us identify areas where we need to improve and our staff found the visit to be informative and useful. “We are pleased the inspection team observed that there is a good standard of cleaning and cleanliness generally. “We have an action plan in place to ensure the requirements and recommendations highlighted are addressed and we will ensure we continue to provide high standards of care and hygiene throughout our healthcare settings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Lawyer Ian Gillies pleaded guilty on Cooper’s behalf to a break-in charge against her. He said he was unable to explain her absence from court. The charge admitted by the duo says they broke into the home of a man, then aged 66, in Prestwick’s Adamton Road South, on October 10 last year.  Graham admitted an additional charge of breaking into the home of a 93-old man in Ayr’s Elba Court, also on October 10 last year. This charge states that she stole around \u0026pound400 in cash from the man. The court heard that Graham, formerly of an address in Ayr’s Russell Drive, now lives in Prestwick. Coopers’ address was given as Murray Gardens in Maybole. The case was adjourned until August 16, when the pair are expected to appear together for sentence.

The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division. \nhttps://t.co/Fzwr1QFfG0\n\u0026mdash Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) \nJuly 31, 2018\nFacebook has ramped up spending on these and other measures, so much so that it finally spooked investors with a forecast of lower profitability last Wednesday.\nFacebook\u0026rsquos shares promptly dropped almost 20% and have not recovered.\nWhile the company would not say who is behind the efforts, Facebook said it uncovered links between the accounts it just deleted and those created by Russia\u0026rsquos Internet Research Agency in the 2016 influence effort.\nFor example, the Atlantic Council\u0026rsquos researchers noted \u0026ldquolanguage patterns that indicate non-native English and consistent mistranslation, as well as an overwhelming focus on polarising issues.\nThe accounts seemed focused on building up an online audience and moving it to offline events, such as protests.\nThe earliest page was created in March 2017.\nFacebook said more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages.\nThe most followed Facebook pages had names such as \u0026ldquoAztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, \u0026ldquoMindful Being, and \u0026ldquoResisters.\nFacebook did not provide detailed descriptions of those pages. But their names parallel those of 2016 groups established by Russian agents to manipulate Americans with particular ethnic, cultural or political identities. That effort targeted people with both liberal and conservative leanings.\nThis time, though, the pages Facebook found focused \u0026ldquoexclusively at engaging and influencing the left end of the American political spectrum, according to the Atlantic Council researchers.\nFacebook says the pages ran about 150 ads for 11,000 dollars on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in US and Canadian dollars. The first ad was created in April 2017 the last was created in June 2018.\nOn a Tuesday conference call, Facebook executives declined to say much more, including whether the pages spanned a range of political opinion and whether the accounts mentioned specific candidates or politicians.\nIt\u0026rsquos clear much more work needs to be done before the midterms to harden our defenses, because foreign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016 \u0026mdash dividing us along political and ideological lines.    \nAs Dan Coats said, the warning lights are blinking red. \nhttps://t.co/ifev077BHe\n\u0026mdash Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) \nJuly 31, 2018\nCalifornia Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said more work needs to be done before the midterm elections.\n\u0026ldquoForeign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016, he said.

But he said that Democrats, not his fellow Republicans, would be the ones supported by Russia.\nOn Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that Mr Trump \u0026ldquohas made it clear his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral process from any nation state or other malicious actors.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Associated Press Reporters\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027dc3dfa79-304a-49eb-be97-3fbee4a3905a\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Facebook finds \\u2018sophisticated\\u2019 efforts to disrupt elections\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"american-bishop-who-preached-at-royal-wedding-has-surgery","story":"The American clergyman who preached about the power of love at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has undergone surgery for prostate cancer.\nAn Episcopal Church spokeswoman said the surgery was performed on Tuesday on the Most Rev Michael Curry.\nThe 65-year-old announced his cancer diagnosis last week and said he planned to have surgery to remove the prostate gland.\nRev Curry said he expected to spend four to six weeks recuperating.

I\u0026rsquod say that\u0026rsquos more than enough to be worth celebrating.\nThe event was first celebrated in 1975 by the Yorkshire Ridings Society, formed a year earlier to protest against the local government reorganisation of the county\u0026rsquos traditional borders.\nIt is always held on August 1, a date that alludes to the Battle of Minden in Germany in 1759, which saw the Army allow soldiers to wear roses in their caps.\nAmong the annual festivities is the reading of the Yorkshire Declaration of Integrity in York, in all the languages used in Yorkshire since its earliest known reference in Anglo-Saxon times, including Old English, Latin, Old Norse and modern English.\n#YorkshireDay\n#Yorkshire\n#Amazing\n#York\n@BenandRoxyFM\n@minsterfm\n@RadioHumberside\n@BBCYork\n@VisitYork\n@yorkpress\n#AllDay\n#onlyinyork\npic.twitter/Vhdyy5TzFA\n\u0026mdash York Maze (@Yorkmaze) \nJuly 29, 2018\nOn Wednesday, the York Maze will play host to its annual Yorkshire pudding tossing competition, while the Yorkshire Open Hat Throwing Championships will be contested at Leeds Industrial Museum.\nAt Kirkgate Market in Leeds, organisers are hoping to break the world record for the most people wearing flat caps at a single event.\nLotherton Hall, a country estate east of Leeds, will be the setting for the revival of the Josh wedding tradition, which sees two miners dressed as a bride and groom take part in a music hall-style marriage to raise money for injured colleagues.\nOtley\u0026rsquos 21 pubs will be temporarily renamed to celebrate some of the county\u0026rsquos most famous faces, allowing drinkers to enjoy a pint at The Dame Judi Dench, The Alan Bennett and The Hannah Cockroft, among others.\n1 lap of Yorkshire    \n472 miles    \nOver 41,000\u0027 of Elivation    \nI have one hell of an adventure in front of me.\n#ukrunchat\n@UKRunChat\n@BreatheUnityPR\n@upandrunninguk\n@Welcome2Yorks\n@saucony\n@SauconyUK\n@MONTANEuk\n@Catererdotcom\n#RUNNINGYORKSHIRE\npic.twitter/w9CWCjVsza\n\u0026mdash Ben Dave (@iambendave) \nJuly 27, 2018\nThe day coincides with the start of fundraiser Ben Davis\u0026rsquos mission to run the perimeter of Yorkshire in a bid to raise \u0026pound15,000 for the Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm) charity.\nHe will run more than 450 miles and take in 41,000ft of elevation, and hopes to complete it in 18 days.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Henry Clare, Press Association\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027734abf12-fe11-496c-b82c-ba4584acc229\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Mayor calls on locals to embrace annual Yorkshire Day celebrations\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"letter campbeltowns best and worst","story":"Campbeltown has been looking great in the spell of good weather we\u0026#8217ve been enjoying of late.Argyll and Bute Council and its staff are to be congratulated on the wonderful displays of flowers and shrubs around the Cross and along Hall Street.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

As the Courier went to press the final figure, including last Friday and Saturday was not available.The Mairi Semple Fund raises funds to help the people of Kintyre who have cancer, and need financial aid to cover the extra expenses.The fund has been in existence for over 40 years and was started by friends and family of Mairi, who had cancer and died when she was only 20.Referral by the Macmillan nurse results in financial aid being given monthly for an initial period of six months, although this can be for longer.Receiving money is a confidential transaction between the fund\u0026#8217s treasurer and the patient.Last year £15,750 was dispensed locally, and this year the Royal Hospital for Children, has been given £2000 and the Beatson, CHAS, Oban and Mid-Argyll Cancer Centres, have all received £1000 each.The fund also provide additional funds if specialist equipment is needed to aid quality of life.There are further flower festival pictures on pages 35 and 36.Relaxing in the garden by Ella Young. 25_c30flowersms01Sport by Judith Marsden. 25_c30flowersms03Music by Eilidh McLellan and Allana Brough. 25_c30flowersms04Freedom by Cathy Irvine. 25_c30flowersms06A picnic by Barbara Rubin. 25_c30flowersms07A good read by Liz Young. 25_c30flowersms08Sailing on a suny afternoon by Margaret Taylor. 25_c30flowersms09The seashore by Anne Clark. 25_c30flowersms10Japanese flower arranging by Pauline and Peter Simson. 25_c30flowersms11Enjoy Kintyre gin by Mary McKinnon and Anne Crossan. 25_c30flowersms12A view from the A\u0026#8217Chleit balcony. 25_c30flowersms13Dog Walking by Pauline and Peter Simson. 25_c30flowersms14Plastic items collected on the beach between A\u0026#8217Chleit and Clachaig Burn in a six hour period. 25_c30flowersms15Being in the garden by Jane Griffiths. 25_c30flowersms16A wee cuppa tea by Marion Warnock. 25_c30flowersms17Dance camp Wales by Lori Silvan. 25_c30flowersms18Simplicity by Jane Miller. 25_c30flowersms19Candles by Morag Johnston. 25_c30flowersms20Tea in the garden by Colleen MacCallum. 25_c30flowersms21Afternoon tea by Margo Pickup. 25_c30flowersms22Gardening by Julie Griffiths. 25_c30flowersms23We\u0026#8217re just pollen your leg and having a laugh honey! by the Beegees Mike and Rachel Stanesby. 25_c30flowersms24These are the things I enjoy by Anne Parkhouse. 25_c30flowersms25A nice cup of tea by Sheena MacFarlane. 25_c30flowersms26Painting by Gustie MacAlister. 25_c30flowersms27Sailing by Karen Kendrick. 25_c30flowersms28Sunshine by Catherine Ralston. 25_c30flowersms29\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pairs paddled hard in doon the watter bowls","story":"The final of the T A Blair sponsored competition, last Friday night, between Archie Johnston and Shona Anderson and Jimmy Anderson and Brian Dewar hinged on a six shot lift by Archie in the second end.This was too much for the Anderson/Dewar duo to claw back despite their best efforts.The closely fought match saw Archie having to ditch the jack in the final end to secure the win.On Saturday Jimmy was in action again at the Argyll and Bute County Finals on the Dunoon Argyll green.Jimmy was accompanied by the four of Gavin McLachlan, Steven Dickson, Robert Todd and Ryan McLachlan and the senior four of John Scott, Neil Maguire, John Mason and Robert MacCallum.Jimmy and Gavin’s foursome returned to Stronvaar as county champions but the senior four lost to Innellan.The action continued on Sunday when the Mac’s Taxis sponsored two bowl pairs was contested.It resulted in a fourth win for Steven Dickson and John McCormick in the final against Bobby Dalziel and Susan Gilchrist.\u0026#8216Doon the Watter\u0026#8217 from left:  President Duncan MacInnes, Shona Anderson, Archie Johnston, Kenneth Blair (sponsor), Jimmy Anderson and Brian Dewar.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

I have got 37 European dates and 15 in the UK, so it is hectic at the moment. We are recording in July and August and then out in September with new material.  A first gig in Edinburgh for several years \u0026ndash at the Queen\u0026rsquos Hall on September 22 \u0026ndash is immediately followed by performances in Liverpool and Royal Leamington Spa.  Then it is across to mainland Europe with Luxembourg, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium all visited.  Fish said he was looking forward to the tour but added: \u0026ldquoIt is daunting \u0026ndash every tour is daunting.  \u0026ldquoBut we have got a super-duper German tour bus this time. I have pulled rank and it is a German bus and you can configure them yourself. I have got a double bed on the upper front lounge.  \u0026ldquoNormally, I sleep in a bunk but it is like a coffin. A tour this long means you need the rest and I have got a six-foot-four frame and need a bed, not a coffin.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to all the places. We have some really big gigs in Holland, the most we have played there in a while, and Germany and Poland have been really good to us.  The album will be recorded at Fish\u0026rsquos home, just outside Haddington. The musician admitted that brought its own challenges and said: \u0026ldquoYou are more easily distracted. In all honesty you can be working in the studio and then you go into the garden and do some weeding for an hour.  \u0026ldquoI enjoy it and like it.  \u0026ldquoI was doing a documentary for Sky Arts and we went to studios in Berlin and it was the first time I have been in another recording studio for a long time.  \u0026ldquoNowadays we have what we need here.  Beyond this year, plans are being drawn up for further tours stretching into 2020, when Fish plans to perform his farewell tour.  Fish, who is no stranger to television and film having appeared in Rebus, Taggart and The Young Person\u0026rsquos Guide to Becoming a Rock Star, is planning to put his writing skills to good use with thoughts turning to screenplays and possibly an autobiography."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8093106.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"belhaven-residents-fed-up-with-intimidating-hot-hatch-speedsters","story":"  Complaints about speeding vehicles and anti-social behaviour on Belhaven\u0026rsquos North Street, Duke Street, Back Road and Shore Road have been passed to East Lothian\u0026rsquos MSP Iain Gray and MP Martin Whitfield.

The group\u0026rsquos spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoWe are just fed up with it.  \u0026ldquoThen there are the young people who go down the front and who throw their rubbish out.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had words with them but it is very intimidating.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom in my early 60s and my husband tends to walk the dogs there now because he is worried about my safety.  The letter sent to the politicians is calling for speed bumps to be introduced on Shore Road and also wants Belhaven included in any plans for a widespread 20mph speed limit in Dunbar.  A suggestion was also made to see a footpath introduced along the length of Back Road to improve safety for pedestrians.  Community warden James Wilson joined Police Constable Gavin Ross in the area last week to try to identify any problems.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThey followed up on complaints of alleged speeding on Shore Road, Duke Street and Back Road and 15 vehicles had their speed checked.  \u0026ldquoSpeed of vehicles (all cars) ranged from 11mph to 22mph.  \u0026ldquoThey also inspected vehicles and spoke to drivers at a nearby car park but there were no issues and no litter. Further spot checks may be carried out.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

Its findings were limited to 32 apparently fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram, which the company removed because they were involved in \u0026ldquocoordinated and \u0026ldquoinauthentic political behaviour.  But official Washington went ballistic anyway, not least because the reported activity so closely mirrored Russian influence efforts during the 2016 presidential election.  Nearly 300,000 people followed at least one of the newly banned accounts and thousands expressed interest in events they promoted.          Sharing an update on our work to remove bad actors on Facebookhttps://t.co/yAn3zF21j4          \u0026mdash Facebook (@facebook) July 31, 2018  \u0026ldquoThis is an absolute attack on our democracy, said Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee and one of several politicians Facebook had briefed in advance.  He expressed \u0026ldquopretty high confidence that Russia was behind the assault.  A spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Facebook had informed his office that \u0026ldquothat a limited group of Russian actors has attempted to spread disinformation using its platform and that the affected groups are affiliated with the political left.  The identified accounts sought to \u0026ldquopromote divisions and set Americans against one another, wrote Ben Nimmo and Graham Brookie of the Atlantic Council\u0026rsquos Digital Forensic Research Lab in a blog post Tuesday.  The non-profit is working with Facebook to find and analyse abuse on its service.  The perpetrators, Facebook noted, have been \u0026ldquomore careful to cover their tracks than in 2016, in part because of steps Facebook has taken to prevent abuse over the past year.  For example, they used virtual private networks and internet phone services to mask their locations, and paid third parties to run ads on their behalf.  After it became clear that Russia-linked actors used social media to try to influence the 2016 US election, Facebook has escalated countermeasures intended to prevent a repeat.  It has cracked down on fake accounts and tried to slow the spread of fake news and misinformation through outside fact-checkers.  The company has also announced new guidelines around political advertisements, requiring disclosure of who paid for them and keeping a database.          I am glad to see that Facebook is taking a much-needed step toward limiting the use of their platform by foreign influence campaigns. The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division. https://t.co/Fzwr1QFfG0          \u0026mdash Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) July 31, 2018  Facebook has ramped up spending on these and other measures, so much so that it finally spooked investors with a forecast of lower profitability last Wednesday.  Facebook\u0026rsquos shares promptly dropped almost 20% and have not recovered.  While the company would not say who is behind the efforts, Facebook said it uncovered links between the accounts it just deleted and those created by Russia\u0026rsquos Internet Research Agency in the 2016 influence effort.  For example, the Atlantic Council\u0026rsquos researchers noted \u0026ldquolanguage patterns that indicate non-native English and consistent mistranslation, as well as an overwhelming focus on polarising issues.  The accounts seemed focused on building up an online audience and moving it to offline events, such as protests.  The earliest page was created in March 2017.  Facebook said more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages.  The most followed Facebook pages had names such as \u0026ldquoAztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, \u0026ldquoMindful Being, and \u0026ldquoResisters.  Facebook did not provide detailed descriptions of those pages. But their names parallel those of 2016 groups established by Russian agents to manipulate Americans with particular ethnic, cultural or political identities. That effort targeted people with both liberal and conservative leanings.  This time, though, the pages Facebook found focused \u0026ldquoexclusively at engaging and influencing the left end of the American political spectrum, according to the Atlantic Council researchers.  Facebook says the pages ran about 150 ads for 11,000 dollars on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in US and Canadian dollars. The first ad was created in April 2017 the last was created in June 2018.  On a Tuesday conference call, Facebook executives declined to say much more, including whether the pages spanned a range of political opinion and whether the accounts mentioned specific candidates or politicians.          It\u0026rsquos clear much more work needs to be done before the midterms to harden our defenses, because foreign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016 \u0026mdash dividing us along political and ideological lines.          As Dan Coats said, the warning lights are blinking red. https://t.co/ifev077BHe          \u0026mdash Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) July 31, 2018  California Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said more work needs to be done before the midterm elections.  \u0026ldquoForeign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016, he said. They are \u0026ldquodividing us along political and ideological lines, to the detriment of our cherished democratic system.  The intelligence panel is planning to hold a hearing in early September with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and an executive from Google.  President Donald Trump has offered mixed messages on Russian interference, at times even calling it a \u0026ldquohoax.

Whilst in Kandy, Buchan Hepburn met Mountbatten and offered his estate as a humble retreat if needed.  Their friendship began to blossom, they would spend time relaxing whilst Buchan Hepburn\u0026rsquos children were at school, discussing the history of India and Ceylon.  On Mountbatten\u0026rsquos final stay at the Estate, he gifted Buchan Hepburn his own union flag as a generous thank you and farewell.

He was a member of one of Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest military families with a pedigree reaching back to the early 17th century.  Like many well-heeled young Scots of the era, the 18-year-old was keen to join the fight against the Kaiser.  He immediately helped to raise a regiment of plantation workers and the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps was duly formed. Buchan-Hepburn was delighted to accept a commission.  With fronts opening up in the Mediterranean area, the regiment was seconded to the Australian army. After training in Egypt, the Ceylon Rifles were despatched to fight the Turks in the Dardanelles, along with other Anzac regiments.  In 1916, the Rifles were part of the unsuccessful Anzac force which went ashore at Gallipoli but were forced to retreat after a bitter campaign by a well-armed, well-drilled Turkish army.  After sustaining heavy losses, the Anzacs withdrew aboard a fleet of troop transporters.  But as the boats pulled away from the beach, a senior officer noticed that the two Union Jacks had been left flying in a forward trench headquarters position.  Shrugging the wound off, however, he wrapped and tied both flags around his body before setting off back down the beach. He reached the waterline without further injury but was shot again as he swam out to sea.

But his ordeal was far from as he was transferred to a hospital ship because of his injuries still clutching the Union Jacks.  On arrival, he was asked if he would like to be bedded down on the top deck or down below because the vessel was very crowded.  While he was settling down on the top deck, the ship was passing out of the Straits of Dardanelle into the Mediterranean Sea, bound for Malta.  Before long it was torpedoed by a German submarine. With the ship sinking and listing on his side of the deck, Buchan-Hepburn, wrapped once again in the two flags, chose his precise moment to jump into the sea.  He swam out to a piece of wreckage and clung on until picked up by a British destroyer which had answered emergency calls. With other Australian wounded he was taken on to Malta.  As he recovered, two generals paid a visit to the ranks of wounded men.  Buchan-Hepburn later went on to serve in some of the harshest battles of the war at the Somme and at Ypres, where he was badly gassed.  At the end of the war he returned to Scotland bringing the precious flags with him to the family home in St Andrews.

Mitch Hunter-Scullion, 23, is seeking \u0026pound2.3 million to build a satellite capable of identifying platinum metal deposits on near-Earth asteroids.  And although it may seem like the science of the future, asteroid mining is expected to become big business as the celestial bodies are believed to be full of precious metals and minerals.  Nasa estimates the total value of resources locked in asteroids is equivalent to $100 billion (\u0026pound75 billion) for each person on Earth.  The Asteroid Mining Corporation headed by Mr\u0026nbspHunter-Scullion has become the first company in the country to join the industry of the future.    He has a plan of action that could see mining start in ten years time.  But first space entrepreneur\u0026nbsphas to launch the UK\u0027s first asteroid mining mission and is seeking \u0026pound2.3m to build a satellite capable of identifying platinum-group metal deposits on near-Earth asteroids.  The Liverpool Hope University student hopes to launch the Asteroid Prospecting Satellite One (APS1) in 2020 from India to conduct a spectral scan and determine if there are \"viable candidates\" for mining.  He calculates that a single metallic asteroid of 25 metres in diameter, contains approximately 29 tonnes of platinum worth around \u0026pound725m.  \"Yes, I think it feasible,\" he said. \u0026ldquoOur goal is to develop ground breaking technology that will eventually enable the extraction, processing and use of materials derived from the many millions of asteroids known to exist near Earth.    \"The APS1 will be our first step to achieving this success. The APS1 will be a spectroscope space telescope which will gather data on target asteroids and will act as a test for some of our technologies which we will scale up later for actual mining missions.  \"Our crowdfunding campaign to help us finance the cost of the APS1 is now up and running and we\u0026rsquore confident we can attract sufficient investment.\"  Mr Hunter-Scullion who set up AMC after completing my dissertation at Liverpool Hope University on asteroid mining added: \"Whilst researching for it I realised that there were few companies that have been set up with the intentions of mining an asteroid, with none being in the UK.    \"It was a topic that fascinated me and when I finished university I decided to set up AMC and begin working on developing technology which will open up the possibilities of an off-Earth commercial market.  With no previous business experience, Mr Hunter-Scullion received support from Business Gateway Glasgow and is now working working to allow the mining to be done legally, He is working with the International Institute of Air and Space Law at Leiden University in the Netherlands to draft a proposal for a UK Space Resources Activities Bill.  The company believe this legislation is vital to the development of the space mining industry within the UK as it allows British based companies the rights to prospect for and extract mineral resources from asteroids, the moon and other celestial bodies.  Mr Hunter Scullion is not alone in recognising the potential of asteroids.  The first asteroid company, Planetary Resources, was founded in 2012 by Diamandis, Chris Lewicki and others in Washington, USA. Within a year the US company Deep Space Industries was set up by Rick Tumlinson, Stephen Cover and a host of others.  Bankers from Goldman Sachs also hope to build an \u0027asteroid-grabbing spacecraft\u0027 to make billions from mining space metals.  A 98-page report from the banking investment company claimed last year that mining asteroids for precious metals in the near future is a \u0027realistic\u0027 goal.  \"Prospecting probes can likely be built for tens of millions of dollars each and Caltech [California Institute of Technology] has suggested an asteroid-grabbing spacecraft could cost $2.6bn,\" the report said.  No asteroid has yet been directly sampled, but Nasa aims to change that with its plans to send a probe to the mineral-rich asteroid 16 Psyche.  16 Psyche is located in the large asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is one of the most mysterious objects in the solar system, and could be worth a small fortune.  It is seen as a 130 mile-wide lump of metal, made up of iron, nickel and rare metals, including gold, platinum and copper.  Nasa announced in January 2017 that it intended to send a probe to the asteroid to sample its chemical make-up in 2022.  It was calculated that the iron in 16 Psyche alone, would be worth \u0026pound8,072 quadrillion."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-asylum-seekers-facing-deportation-tell-of-flight-from-afghanistan","story":"  Bilal Quereshi, 25, feared for his life until he was packed into a lorry by his uncle and spirited across the border into Iran at the dead of night.

A private firm housing thousands of refugees in Glasgow says it will start evicting up to 300 people who have been told they cannot stay in Britain.  Serco have issued a first six \u0026ldquolock change notices yesterday giving residents a week to get out with nowhere else to go.  Mr Quereshi says the stress of being threatened with being sent back to Afghanistan has caused severe mental health issues as he faces Taliban retribution on his return.  He said: \"I came here because I thought I would be safe. I was tortured by the Taliban and it was only thanks to my uncle that I got out.  \"I had to travel through Iran and Turkey before I paid to cross the Med but the man in charge of the boat threw my bag over the side with all my documents in it.  \"It was a terrible journey and I thought I would be safe when I got here. I love Glasgow and want to study here but instead I face going back.  \"I need it to be sorted out very quickly but it has dragged on for so long. I am currently homeless and I haven\u0027t eaten properly for weeks. It\u0027s a desperate situation\".  His predicament is shared by his fellow Afghan asylum seekers in Glasgow as Serco issue notices to the elderly and young families.  One such family is Hameeda Mohammed, 65, who arrived in the city 10 years ago with her husband and young son after fleeing the Taliban.  She was a teacher at a girls school but was regularly targeted by the ultra-conservative group as they do not approve of females teaching or girls receiving education.  To get past the group to carry on teaching she donned a burkha every day to hide her face and changed its colours every few days to make it look like she was a different person.  Eventually she fled with her husband and son and flew to the UK and they settled in Springburn where she teaches Afghan children English.  But she breaks down when she considers receiving one of the letters that will send them back to Afghanistan.  She said: \"My husband has heart problems and cannot fly. We have various doctors letters confirming this but still they might want to send us back.  \"We came here to feel safe and enjoy the last years of our lives but instead we face this. My husband hasn\u0027t eaten since we heard about the letters and he is already in bad health.  \"My son wants to study at university and he is a straight A\u0027s student but he cannot study here. It is awful, this city is our home and we feel very welcome here.\"  It is a similar situation facing Shafiqi Mohammadi who arrived in the UK last year to escape the daily bombardment of her neighbourhood in Kapisa Province, north of the Afghan capital Kabul.  Her father was killed by the Taliban so she fled with her three young sons hoping for a better, quieter life in the west.  They settled first in Austria but arrived in Glasgow last year and her sons attend Drumchapel High School.  Eldest son Mohammad, 16, wants to be a mechanical engineer, his brother Hamid, 15, wants to be an aeronautical engineer and the youngest, 13-year-old Hamid wants to be a banker.  But instead they might not even return to school next term after the holidays are finished as they face the same Serco sanctions.  She said: \"I am happy In Glasgow and my boys are doing well at school. After what happened before we left Afghanistan, we can\u0027t go back there.  \"Every day was constant shelling and we could not leave the house and my sons could not go to school.  \"We feel happy and safe here and I do not understand why they want to lock us out of our homes. We are supposed to be safe here.\"  Her eldest son Mohammed added: \"I remember how bad it was back home. We had to get out for our safety. We can\u0027t go back there and go through that again every day\".  With that thought he shivers, and stares away, recoiling at the situation he would be thrown back into."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-time-to-look-at-abolishing-scotland-office","story":"  The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee today delivers a damning verdict on how Whitehall approaches devolution in general and how it dealt with the Scottish Government on Brexit in particular.  The report says devolution has \u0026ldquoarguably qualified Westminster\u0026rsquos sovereignty and changed the balance of powers across the UK.  But it notes: \u0026ldquoWhitehall still operates extensively on the basis of a structure and culture which take little account of the realities of devolution in the UK. This is inimical to the principles of devolution and good governance in the UK.  It says it was \u0026ldquohighly regrettable that there was little consultation with the devolved governments over the EU Withdrawal Bill as more liaison could have avoided much of the acrimony that was generated.  In future, the committee suggests, draft legislation should be shared with the devolved governments to identify and work through issues in advance.  In recognition of the significance of devolution to the UK\u0026rsquos constitutional arrangements, MPs call on the UK Government to establish a \u0026ldquoDevolution Policy for the Union, including giving more consideration to England.  In a key section, the report says it is important Theresa May and her colleagues recognise the reserved powers model of devolution means \u0026ldquopowers are devolved by default and not conferred by the UK Parliament, suggesting that it agrees powers held by the EU should go straight to Holyrood post-Brexit.  Yet it also \u0026ldquoacknowledges the practical difficulties that arise from Brexit and the Government\u0026rsquos need to find practical solutions to address them.  The report goes on to say there is \u0026ldquoconsiderable ambiguity surrounding the Sewel convention and that the UK Government chose to interpret it in such a way that legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament was deemed unnecessary.  It recommends in future clear statements of circumstances under which legislative consent is not required by the convention should be clearly set out.  The MPs also:  *say England should be better represented in the constitution, warning a failure to do so \u0026ldquorisks a sense of increasing disconnection of the English people from the political system  *express concern about the Government\u0026rsquos attitude towards the post-Brexit UK common frameworks, calling on it to publish a coherent policy  *say current inter-governmental relationship mechanisms are \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose and recommend a fresh structure be established along with a new system for inter-parliamentary scrutiny to hold the governments of the UK to account.  The report calls for a devolution review in the year following Brexit, covering how Whitehall is structured and how it relates to the devolved administrations.  \u0026ldquoThis review, it says, \u0026ldquoshould also consider whether the role of the territorial offices in Whitehall and corresponding Secretaries of State are still necessary and, if they are, whether they might be reformed to promote better relations across Whitehall with the devolved administrations.  Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU will change the UK\u0026rsquos constitutional arrangements, so it needs a rethink.  \u0026ldquoWe recommend the Government sets out a clear devolution policy for the Union as we leave the EU failure to do this just prolongs misunderstandings, which are the basis for more conflict.  Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe EU Withdrawal Act is a power-grab on the Scottish Parliament and this report demonstrates that fundamental change is required within the UK Government to ensure devolution is respected.  He suggested it was astonishing how 20 years on from the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the committee highlighted how training in Whitehall about how devolution worked was still required.  \u0026ldquoBut more than training is needed, he declared. \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has already said there needs to be a requirement in law for the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos consent before Westminster legislates on devolved issues.  Mr Russell added: \u0026ldquoThere has been little meaningful engagement throughout this process and it is time the UK Government respected the views of the Scottish Parliament and abandoned its pursuit of a hard Brexit.  His SNP colleague, Ronnie Cowan, who sits on the committee, said: \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoWhat we are witnessing is a blatant Westminster power-grab after twenty years of devolution.  \u0026ldquoIt is the arrogance of the Tories who think they can rip up the devolution settlement and transfer powers to Westminster. The fact that the committee is now questioning whether the Scotland Office and the office of Secretary of State are necessary is a humiliation for David Mundell who has clearly failed to justify his job.  Willie Rennie for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the report was a \u0026ldquopowerful rebuke to those who think the only way is separation and division.  Saying it was urgent for the committee\u0027s recommendations to be enacted to allow all the governments to work together, he added: \u0026ldquoThe prize will be a UK which has decentralised and devolved power but which can still work as a whole when the issues affect everyone across these islands.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire United Kingdom and have been absolutely clear that when devolved powers are returned from Brussels, the vast majority will go straight to the devolved administrations.  \"For the past year, we have been focused on constructively engaging with the devolved administrations and continue to have regular meetings with them, held at all levels, including the Joint Ministerial Committees and Ministerial Forums.  \"All sides have committed to continuing to work together, including building common frameworks so that UK businesses won\u0027t face a cliff edge on the day we leave the EU.\""},{"url":null,"title":"birds-of-a-feather-artist-accuses-fringe-of-copying-his-festival-pigeon-idea","story":"  Frank Fancier last year worked with arts company Artobotic to create a series of model pigeons, which were \"released\" throughout the Fringe.  Mr Fancier\u0027s project urged people pick up the models, take a photo and then share the image on social media.  Last year the comedian and presenter Phill Jupitus was pictured with one of the avian artworks, which have travelled as far as the Antarctic and Hong Kong.  This year, as part of its marketing drive, the Fringe has launched #catchthepigeon, in which a small flock of gold pigeon models have been hidden in Edinburgh: the public are being urged to pick up the models, take a photo and share on social media.  Mr Fancier believes the Fringe have copied his idea, and would like to have some acknowledgement for the idea.  He said: \"I have never seen anyone else who has had this idea.  \"It does seem like my idea has been copied - apart from some black marks on the face of the pigeon, it is the same.  \"I am just looking for some credit for the idea.\"  He: \"This may just be a very large coincidence, but it does seem strange that exactly one year after I released metallic pigeons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the marketing team of the same name are now releasing metallic pigeons at the Fringe.  \"Pigeons are a perfect representation of an underclass that gets easily overlooked.

Mr Kerevan, SNP MP for East Lothian from 2015 to 2017, gives a behind-the-scenes account of the start of the Commission in the new Scottish Left Review.  The Commission\u0027s report, largely written by corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson, advocates keeping the pound for at least a decade after a Yes vote in an informal currency union.  The report also says public spending should growth very slowly in order to halve the deficit.  The plan has infuriated many on the left of the SNP, and been described by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies as a continuation of current austerity measures.  Mr Kerevan revealed that after Nicola Sturgeon announced the Commission in late 2016, he and two other SNP MPs with backgrounds in economics met Mr Wilson to discuss it.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoAndrew explained that the primary task of the Commission - given the imminent likelihood of a second referendum - was to provide a fresh and robust set of economic arguments supporting independence.  \u0026ldquoIn particular, we had to replace the notion of a sterling union with the rest of Britain - a position which was seen as having been a major reason we lost the 2014 referendum.  \u0026ldquoAs I remember, it was taken for granted that the Commission was there to justify a switch to a separate Scottish currency and a break with sterling.  However, the Commission \u0026ldquochanged tack after the 2017 general election, and when it was published in May, Mr Kerevan said that \u0026ldquosurprisingly (given earlier discussions), the report proposes that an independent Scotland keep sterling unilaterally for at least a decade.  He said that was technically feasible but would \u0026ldquoleave the SNP back where it started in 2014, with interest rates, mortgage rates, and the external exchange rate determined by the Bank of England, tying the Scottish economy to the UK\u0026rsquos.  An SNP source said Mr Kerevan may have \u0026ldquomisunderstood the Commission\u0026rsquos remit, which was to \u0026ldquoconsider the most appropriate monetary policy arrangements to underpin a programme for sustainable growth in an independent Scotland.  It was therefore not fixed on a new currency, but explored a range of options, and concluded that a new currency could not be achieved overnight."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-set-for-special-question-time-with-children-and-young-people","story":"  The SNP leader is regularly questioned by opposition leaders at the Scottish Parliament and backbenchers at First Minister\u0027s Questions.

All Sulwaths ales are made and put into casks or bottled on the premises, with visitors able to sample the beers in the brewery reception and bar area.  Fully licensed, the visitor centre is open Monday to Saturday, with tours available on Mondays and Fridays.

Andrew Chapman, Director of Sales \u0026amp Marketing at Keith Brewery Ltd, said \u0026ldquoWith the two breweries only five miles apart, the merger seems an obvious solution to reduce the duplication of costs across various departments in both businesses.  \"There were a lot of synergies across both companies and it is hoped that both breweries can provide missing pieces of the puzzle to each other, such as staffing, bottling and\u0026nbspkegging facilities, storage and logistics.  David MacDonald, Founder of Spey Valley Brewery, added \u0026ldquoThere has been a great relationship between the two breweries for many years and this move formalises that. It allows both to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our existing customers and gives us time to work on developing new business that would have been difficult to achieve working independently.  It will also allow the brewers at both premises to share knowledge, information and best practise techniques, which is essential when producing the best beer possible.    The merger follows on from the success of both breweries in 2017, with Keith Brewery Ltd\u0026rsquos coffee stout (Stout Keith, 5% ABV) becoming the only Scottish beer to receive the maximum 3* from The Great Taste Guide and Spey Valley\u0026rsquos bitter ale (David\u0026rsquos Not So Bitter, 4.4% ABV) winning Best British Style Beer at the Scottish Beer Awards.

This prompted a joke, suggesting that the only remedy would be to set up a brewery. This must be the solution, right?  Three years later, in 1995, we brewed our first ales \u0026ndash Red Cuillin and Black Cuillin. We always knew that these were to be our first two ales - named after the two mountain ranges on the island. They were such a success, we still brew them to the same recipes today. The only difference? The names have changed \u0026ndash we now call them Skye Red and Skye Black.    The choice of names behind our beers are laden with meanings. For instance, the name of our Young Pretender beer was decided upon for its historic associations. Firstly, and most obviously, it was first brewed in 1995, which was the 250th anniversary of the 1745 rebellion. This was the rebellion in which Bonnie Prince Charlie (known as The Young Pretender) attempted to gain the British crown. It was Bonnie Prince Charlie\u0026rsquos historic association with Skye which led us to create our Young Pretender beer.    Our Young Pretender ale has went on to win numerous awards \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoChampion Bitter of Scotland 2016\u0026rsquo and finalist at Great British Beer Festival 2017. However, don\u0026rsquot be fooled, it\u0026rsquos not just Young Pretender winning all the awards. In 1997, way back when, we won the CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) Champion Beer of Scotland and we were shortlisted for the UK championship too. To date, we\u0026rsquove picked up over 60 awards\u0026hellipand counting. Not bad for what started as a joke over a few pints.

Mr Hunt noted: \"France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the Commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.\"  The Secretary of State said a no-deal scenario would have \u0026ldquoprofound economic consequences for the rest of Europe and make it harder for European businesses to access finance via the City.  \"Probably the City, as the financier of European business, is the central point to make here. If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial, declared Mr Hunt.  \"The City itself would find a way to thrive, whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. If it became a low-tax, low-regulation, offshoot fully outside the EU, it would find a way to thrive in those circumstances. But for European businesses the impact would be profound,\" he insisted.

The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 3:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me. You don\u0026rsquot know the last time they talk to someone. That\u0026rsquos the nitty gritty of it.\"Smile and say hello, and help them if they need it.

I don\u0026rsquot get benefits, this is my only source of income, and I travel up on the bus here from Inverness every day to do it. I\u0026rsquom always on my pitch.

I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 3:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

Is Edinburgh in danger of killing the golden goose by pricing artists out of appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe? £500 for an overnight hotel stay is an eye-watering sum. But prices are high right across Scotland. Even in June a popular booking site had no hotel or bed and breakfast availability in the Oban and Lorn area for the entire week. A trip to Eigg earlier this month found only a couple of B\u0026ampBs for £70-£100 in the Mallaig-Arisaig area and “No vacancy” signs outside every camp/caravan site. Luckily, I stayed with friends whose summer months are now busy and sociable with cost-cutting visits from friends and family. When they travel elsewhere in Scotland, they do the same. It’s a great way to live and travel – if you have a wheen of like-minded, far-flung acquaintances with plenty of space. But if you don’t, the novel combination of brilliant summer weather and high staycationing demand from the rest of Britain creates a problem. Put simply, Scotland is fast becoming an impossibly expensive holiday location for folk actually living here.            The collapse in sterling since Brexit means a £100 bed and breakfast is less daunting for Europeans who also plan ahead. But Scots, prompted to explore their own country at the last minute by prolonged good weather and the relatively higher costs of foreign travel, are finding day trips or wild camping are the only “holidays” they can afford.            It doesn’t have to be like this.Across northern Europe and the world’s wooded latitudes, wooden weekend huts have traditionally come to the rescue, removing locals from the commercial holiday market and offering the possibility of long, leisurely stays during the summer, extended family reunions at Easter and sanity-restoring breaks every weekend throughout the year. Norway has the world’s highest GDP and the highest rate of hut ownership, with one basic wooden hut for every ten Norwegians. In 2006, there were 429,093 holiday homes in Norway, of which the vast majority (398,884) were huts rather than converted farmhouses (30,209) in a population of 4.6 million. A further 55,000 holiday homes were owned by Norwegians abroad. That’s one hytte (hut) per 11 Norwegians (roughly one per extended family) for year-round relaxation, connection with nature, exercise, escape from city pressures and strengthening family ties. Few huts have running water (thanks to freezing winters) although some have electricity and most are custom-built with wood-burning stoves. They are close enough to reach every weekend (usually within 25 miles and one hour’s drive) and the hytte habit is a marker of wealth, not poverty. Norway is one of the world’s most equal societies, and since second homes are generally modest purpose-built huts, not family homes from the local housing stock, ownership isn’t regarded as elitist, greedy or wasteful. A smart system called boplikt has created two separate housing markets by designating huts as temporary and family homes as permanent dwellings. Houses in each category cannot have a change of use. Thus family houses in remote areas cannot be bought or used as second homes. In 1991 there was also one cabin per 12 Swedes, one per 18 Finns and one per 33 Danes, along with widespread cabin ownership in Russia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain plus America, Canada and New Zealand.Scotland has the lowest rate of hut ownership in northern Europe. In 2000 only 630 huts remained in Scotland – most without rights of tenancy or improvement. Since then hundreds have been evicted, although Carbeth hutters raised almost £2 million to achieve a land buyout in 2013.            Of course, not everyone wants a basic, back-to-nature, wooden hut. But thousands do. And unless working families find the land and encouragement to take up hutting, holidays here will continue to be a greater luxury than a package holiday abroad and unemployed Scots will remain walled up in city estates without hope of escape. Maybe that’s a bigger social problem than the prices facing artists at the Edinburgh Fringe?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776226.1533041292!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland office could be abolished mps suggest in new report","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        A Commons report has criticised Whitehalls\u0026#8217s approach to devolution and suggested that the role of the Scottish secretary in the UK cabinet could be abolished.                The devolution settlements were set up 20 years ago in the context of EU membership, said Sir Bernard, who is chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee.            A committee of MPs concluded in a report that Whitehall officials are not properly trained to understand devolution and mechanisms for the UK’s governments to discuss vital issues such as Brexit are “not fit for purpose.”            The report said devolution has “arguably qualified” Westminster’s sovereignty and changed the balance of powers across the UK.READ MORE: Whitehall officials ‘do not understand’ Scottish devolutionIt also notes: “Whitehall still operates extensively on the basis of a structure and culture which take little account of the realities of devolution in the UK. This is inimical to the principles of devolution and good governance in the UK.”MPs on the committee said it was “highly regrettable that there was little consultation with devolved governments in advance of the publication of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, as earlier consultation could have possibly avoided much of the acrimony that was created between the UK government and the devolved governments”.The report calls for a devolution review in the year following Brexit, covering how Whitehall is structured and how it relates to the devolved administrations.            “This review,” it says, “should also consider whether the role of the territorial offices in Whitehall and corresponding Secretaries of State are still necessary and, if they are, whether they might be reformed to promote better relations across Whitehall with the devolved administrations.”READ MORE: Doctors warn Brexit is ‘bad for health’ as calls grow for new EU vote"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775976.1532978152!/image/image.jpg","title":"public to have a say on naming inverness airport after loch ness","story":"        The public is to be consulted on plans to rebrand Inverness Airport as \u0026#8220Loch Ness Airport\u0026#8221.                Bosses there have launched a Twitter consultation to gauge support for the proposal. They are asking: “Should we change our name to Inverness Loch Ness Airport?”             As of yesterday evening, around 400 votes had been cast with a large majority against the move.             The controversial name change suggestion has previously been mooted by \u2028local business and tourism chiefs. Willie Cameron, business development director for Cobbs Group, said he is “100 per cent behind” the name change and believes now is the right time for it, particularly given the growing market for travel in Scotland from the Far East. He said most bookings are done through smartphone and tablet devices and tourists will have a greater appreciation of the Loch Ness name, with a rebranding working better for search engine optimisation. Mr Cameron said: “I think the team at Inverness Airport is doing a great job by working hard to get more flights in there. They are also going to get the new train station coming in there as part of the future plans. “I would say expand the airport and runway.             “If it turns out that the public want them to change the name, it will enhance the number of international carriers coming into the airport.” He added that the Inverness name change was just as plausible as Liverpool changing its name to John Lennon Airport, which is iconic for that area. Stewart Nicol, Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive, said that his team have promoted the idea in the past, adding: “A name change immediately identifies the airport with one of the biggest draws to the region for tourism. Loch Ness is iconic across the globe.” A Highlands and Islands Airport Ltd spokesman said: “The idea of including Loch Ness in the name of Inverness Airport has been raised in the past and we thought it would be interesting to gauge the response from the public.             “As yet there are no plans to take the idea further.” It is understood that the idea would only be taken further through major backing from several tourism agencies, including the likes of VisitScotland.

It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session.

The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 1 Aug 2018 3:44 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

They need to be clear as to whether they are prepared to defend a lack of integrity in public office,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27426  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nJoint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met today in London today for the first time in ten years. \nThe body involves ministers from both the British and Irish governments meeting to discuss a range of issues was created by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \nThe conference has not met since 2007, shortly before the return of the political institutions in the north when Sinn Féin and the DUP agreed to share power. \nSinn Féin have been calling for a meeting of the conference to be convened ever since the DUP collapsed talks designed to reestablish an Executive in February. \nSinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill welcomed today\u0027s meeting, describing it as an \"important step\" towards power sharing. \n“Today’s conference of both the Irish and British Governments is an important step to help remove the obstacles to genuine power-sharing and for London and Dublin to fulfil their own obligations in respect to the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and other outstanding matters relating to citizens\u0027 rights, legacy matters and All-Ireland co-operation.\n“In the absence of the Assembly and Executive at this time, the choice is between the protection of the Good Friday Agreement which is under constant attack, by the hard Brexiteers within the DUP and Tory party, or its abandonment.\n“We have made clear that for Irish nationalism any return to British direct rule would represent its abandonment and is therefore unacceptable.\nMichelle O\u0027Neill said both the British and Irish governments have a responsibility to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. \n“Together both governments have a clear duty under the Good Friday Agreement to make determined efforts to support the re-establishment of the institutions.\n“Joint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.\n“The conference allows both governments to co-operate at all levels on all matters and despite the fact they allowed it to lapse, having not met since 2007, we welcome today’s meeting and the fact the Governments themselves are getting back on board with this process,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27427  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language - Declan Kearney\nAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough council is overwhelmingly unionist.\nThe Borough makes up the larger part of my South Antrim constituency.\nOn the 26th February last the council rejected a petition to support the provision of bilingual (English and Irish) streets/roads signage in the area.\nUnionist councillors then decided to go a step further and passed a motion committing Antrim and Newtownabbey council to an ‘English only’ policy.\n\nThat was a ridiculous and stupid stance to adopt.\nIt is also unlawful.\nThis new council policy is in breach of Article 11 of the Local Government Order 1995, and it violates the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.\nBut it is also an affront to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).\nThe decision taken was a deeply insulting message aimed directly at those who live and pay rates within Antrim and Newtownabbey who identify as Irish citizens, who cherish the Irish language, and Gaelic cultural traditions.\nIt does not matter in the narrow, blinkered world of those who control political unionism in Antrim and Newtownabbey council that the Irish language and cultural identity actually matters to a significant section of rate payers in the borough.\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association runs deep in this part of County Antrim. It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

sale after the club rejected a bid from Irish League champions Crusaders.\nIt is understood the offer would have smashed the Irish League transfer fee record which remains the �50,000 Linfield paid for striker Glenn Ferguson in 1998.\nMcGonigle (22) has been the Stripes\u0027 top scorer in each of the last two seasons and notched 20 goals in the 2017/18 season.\nThe Dungiven man\u0027s eye-catching performances saw him nominated for the Ulster Footballer of the Year Award while he was named in the NI Football Writers\u0027 Team of the Year.\nThe bid being rejected is absolutely the stance that we have taken, Bannsiders\u0027 boss Kearney told The Chronicle.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36707179.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/012-_Read-Only_%202.jpg","title":"revealed gcse league table for northern ireland 2018 where did your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils.

Former North Belfast MLA Alban Maginness has in the past said he \"disagreed with same-sex marriage\" after missing a vote in the Assembly.\n\nAfter rejecting his claims, Ms Hanna then called Mr Gray Sloan a \"d**k,\" prompting one Twitter user to say \"don\u0027t hold back Claire\", to which she replied: \"The wee lad needs some help. Probably all bent out of shape that hostility issues like is [sic] are the biggest driver away from Irish unity and the DUP are the biggest driver for it.  Hardly blame him for being upset.\"\n\nMr Gray Sloan said he was challenging the SDLP\u0027s record on LGBT rights.\n\n\"Her response is beneath the office of MLA,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe tweet sparked a huge reaction on Twitter. Sinn Fein\u0027s Michelle O\u0027Neill called for the South Belfast representative to withdraw the remarks.\n\n\"Claire Hanna should withdraw her needlessly crude comments made on Twitter this evening.

He admitted uncertainty around Brexit was playing a role.\n\n\"We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together,\" Mr Varadkar said.\n\n\"I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running.\"\n\nTalks over the past 18 months have failed to broker agreement between the two main parties.\n\nIn February Sinn Fein published parts of what it claimed was a draft agreement which would have restored government. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster said there was never any agreement she could put to her party.\n\nIn the intervening months Secretary of State Karen Bradley has resisted bringing in full direct rule although she has had to introduce legislation from Westminster to ensure government operations can continue.

We have worked hard to reach agreement since Martin McGuinness resigned.”\n\nShe criticised the DUP for allegedly walking away from a previous attempt to reach agreement and the unionist party’s “negative” pact with the Conservatives.\n\n“It is not acceptable that the people of the North have had their rights denied and their agreements left unimplemented.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"childrens play centre closed after major incident","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I’d say that’s more than enough to be worth celebrating.”\n\nThe event was first celebrated in 1975 by the Yorkshire Ridings Society, formed a year earlier to protest against the local government reorganisation of the county’s traditional borders.\n\nIt is always held on August 1, a date that alludes to the Battle of Minden in Germany in 1759, which saw the Army allow soldiers to wear roses in their caps.\n\nAmong the annual festivities is the reading of the Yorkshire Declaration of Integrity in York, in all the languages used in Yorkshire since its earliest known reference in Anglo-Saxon times, including Old English, Latin, Old Norse and modern English.\n\n\n\n#YorkshireDay\n \n#Yorkshire\n \n#Amazing\n \n#York\n \n@BenandRoxyFM\n \n@minsterfm\n \n@RadioHumberside\n \n@BBCYork\n

Yorkshire pudding tossing competition, while the Yorkshire Open Hat Throwing Championships will be contested at Leeds Industrial Museum.\n\nAt Kirkgate Market in Leeds, organisers are hoping to break the world record for the most people wearing flat caps at a single event.\n\nLotherton Hall, a country estate east of Leeds, will be the setting for the revival of the Josh wedding tradition, which sees two miners dressed as a bride and groom take part in a music hall-style marriage to raise money for injured colleagues.\n\nOtley’s 21 pubs will be temporarily renamed to celebrate some of the county’s most famous faces, allowing drinkers to enjoy a pint at The Dame Judi Dench, The Alan Bennett and The Hannah Cockroft, among others.\n\n\n1 lap of Yorkshire\n\n472 miles\n\nOver 41,000\u0027

I wasn’t going to wait for her to wean to start taking care of myself,” Yuri, from Texas, told the Press Association. \n\nThe little girl, who Yuri has chosen not to name in the media, tends to play as Yuri works out but often wants to breastfeed midway through the exercises. For that reason, Yuri prefers to workout as her daughter sleeps.\n\n“She mostly wants to eat when I’m laying on my back doing crunches or some other workout where I’m laying on the floor.”\n\nYuri breastfed her firstborn for 18 months. Her second child was formula fed and she struggled to breastfeed her third after a complicated start and her return to work, but her youngest, seen in the pictures, has “breastfed like a champ since day one”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Yuri Rydel)\n\n\n\n\nShe wanted to tell other breastfeeding mums that taking care of yourself didn’t have to mean an end to breastfeeding.\n\n“We don’t have to wait to stop breastfeeding, we don’t have to stop breastfeeding early just to get healthy – we can do both. \n\n“I realise that there will always be people who want to be negative about this topic. Hopefully, one day, when my daughters start a family they can freely breastfeed without fear of being bashed by a stranger.”\n\nOnline she wrote: “I’m not the only mom who is finally making time to care for themselves while taking care of their little ones.”\n\nYuri’s final pregnancy took her above 200lbs (14 stone 2lbs).\n\n“I said, ‘Oh well, I’ll never be at healthy weight again’. It wasn’t until I hit 221lbs that I decided I had to do this, for myself and my kids.”\n\nSo far Yuri, who married in 2015, has dropped 43lbs (3 stone), and wants to lose another 40lbs (2 stone 8lbs).\n"},{"url":null,"title":"people are upset that these futuristic things havent arrived in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The goal of these operations is to sow discord, distrust, and division. \nhttps://t.co/Fzwr1QFfG0\n\n— Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) \nJuly 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\nFacebook has ramped up spending on these and other measures, so much so that it finally spooked investors with a forecast of lower profitability last Wednesday. \n\nFacebook’s shares promptly dropped almost 20% and have not recovered.\n\nWhile the company would not say who is behind the efforts, Facebook said it uncovered links between the accounts it just deleted and those created by Russia’s Internet Research Agency in the 2016 influence effort.\n\nFor example, the Atlantic Council’s researchers noted “language patterns that indicate non-native English and consistent mistranslation, as well as an overwhelming focus on polarising issues”. \n\nThe accounts seemed focused on building up an online audience and moving it to offline events, such as protests.\n\nThe earliest page was created in March 2017. \n\nFacebook said more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages. \n\nThe most followed Facebook pages had names such as “Aztlan Warriors,” Black Elevation”, “Mindful Being”, and “Resisters”.\n\nFacebook did not provide detailed descriptions of those pages. But their names parallel those of 2016 groups established by Russian agents to manipulate Americans with particular ethnic, cultural or political identities. That effort targeted people with both liberal and conservative leanings.\n\nThis time, though, the pages Facebook found focused “exclusively at engaging and influencing the left end of the American political spectrum,” according to the Atlantic Council researchers.\n\nFacebook says the pages ran about 150 ads for 11,000 dollars on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in US and Canadian dollars. The first ad was created in April 2017 the last was created in June 2018.\n\nOn a Tuesday conference call, Facebook executives declined to say much more, including whether the pages spanned a range of political opinion and whether the accounts mentioned specific candidates or politicians.\n\n\nIt’s clear much more work needs to be done before the midterms to harden our defenses, because foreign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016 — dividing us along political and ideological lines. \n\nAs Dan Coats said, the warning lights are blinking red. \nhttps://t.co/ifev077BHe\n\n— Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) \nJuly 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said more work needs to be done before the midterm elections.\n\n“Foreign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016,” he said. They are “dividing us along political and ideological lines, to the detriment of our cherished democratic system.”\n\nThe intelligence panel is planning to hold a hearing in early September with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and an executive from Google.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has offered mixed messages on Russian interference, at times even calling it a “hoax”.\n\nAfter appearing to question whether the Russians would try again to interfere earlier this month, he acknowledged last week in a tweet that the midterms were a likely target. But he said that Democrats, not his fellow Republicans, would be the ones supported by Russia.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that Mr Trump “has made it clear his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral process from any nation state or other malicious actors”.\n"}]
