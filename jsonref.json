Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

But there’s a positivity, and members are picking up on that.”Ian Marshall, the former independent unionist senator and now member of the UUP, has detected a change. There is a “feeling of positivity and of hope”, he said in Beattie, there is a leader who is “proud to say I’m British, I’m Irish, I’m working for everybody in Northern Ireland”.The most recent LucidTalk opinion poll, published in August, would appear to endorse both Beattie and his party he is second only to his party colleague, Stormont Minister for Health Robin Swann, in the approval ratings, and the UUP, on 16 per cent, is ahead of both the DUP and the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).Yet, as every politician knows, the only numbers that count are those tallied on election day last time around, in admittedly very different circumstances in 2017, the UUP polled 13 per cent to the DUP’s 28.In 2015, taking two seats in the Westminster elections made for a confident party conference, but brought no boost to UUP numbers when it came to the Assembly vote in 2016.Beattie and the UUP has set out its stall it remains to be seen whether enough voters will buy what they are selling."},{"url":null,"title":"austrian leader resigning over inquiry into suspected corruption","story":" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announces his resignation  at the Chancellery in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday.

But the left-wing party has said the investigation makes Mr Kurz unfit to serve as Chancellor and called on his party to name a successor who was “beyond reproach”.The Greens began talks on Friday with Austria’s three opposition parties, which have all demanded that Mr Kurz resign and plan to submit one or more no-confidence motions against him at a special session of parliament on Tuesday.

Photograph: AFPGettyCzech voters today evicted the communists from parliament for the first time since the end of the second World War, voting out a party whose forebears had ruled the central European nation from 1948 until the Velvet Revolution of 1989 that ushered in democracy.The communists jailed tens of thousands in forced labour camps in the 1950s and brutally repressed dissidents such as playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel, but remained in parliament following the revolution in the then Czechoslovakia.In this week’s election, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia took 3.62 per cent of the votes with nearly all precincts reporting, less than the 5 per cent needed to enter parliament. This potentially marks a final chapter for a party that has gradually shrunk as its ageing membership has dwindled.“It pleases me, it pleases me a lot,” Jiri Gruntorad (69), a former dissident who signed the dissident Charter 77 statement and was jailed for subversion from 1981 to 1985 by the communist authorities, told Reuters. “But it’s coming too late.“It was one of the last communist parties in the world apart from the Chinese and Cuban ones that held on to its name. The others have at least renamed themselves and started behaving a little differently.”Surprise resultVoters also handed a defeat to prime minister Andrej Babis’s ANO party, giving their backing to centre-right opposition group Together in a surprise result.After 1989, the communists sought to appeal to senior citizens and working class Czechs, but they never resonated with younger voters and failed to shake off the party’s history as totalitarian rulers who had stifled freedom.“I am very disappointed because it is a really big failure,” said Communist Party leader Vojtech Filip, who also resigned.Mr Havel opposed banning the party – which had resisted the country’s European Union and Nato membership and kept warm ties with Russia and China – despite calls from the public to do so.The communists lingered mostly in isolation after 1989, though they co-operated with other parties seeking votes to pass legislation in parliament. They were also close to current President Milos Zeman.The party regained influence in 2018 when Mr Babis – a former Communist Party member – leaned on them to support his minority government with the Social Democrats.It was the closest the party came to power since 1989, but appears also to represent their final act as a political force in the former Soviet-bloc nation.“I am overjoyed that this era is now over – not only for those of us still living, but also for those who have passed away and who were persecuted by the regime,” said Hana Palcova (74), who left the country under threat from the secret police. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"airlines could grounded pilot shortage hundreds retire change","story":"Britain faces a shortage of pilots when full flight schedules resume after hundreds of airline crew retired or switched careers during the Covid pandemic, with many others requiring retraining.Ministers fear a potential shortfall in pilot numbers could hamper the return to pre-pandemic numbers of flights following a devastating 19 months for aviation. Experts have suggested the industry faces a global shortage of some 34,000 pilots by 2025.Aviation sources said the number of pilots who retired during the pandemic was believed to be at least double the usual levels after many were furloughed or offered redundancy packages.The disclosure comes after ministers slashed the number of destinations on the Government\u0027s red list in one of the biggest reopenings of foreign travel since the start of the pandemic.The  revealed the move last week, before the list was scaled back to just seven destinations on Thursday.But it is understood that senior ministers have discussed concerns that the aviation industry may find itself with insufficient pilots to meet demand as restrictions continue to lift over the coming months, and as airlines seek to introduce summer schedules from next Easter onwards.Martin Chalk, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u0027 Association (Balpa), confirmed that the aviation industry also feared a shortage of pilots.One problem was that many have had insufficient time flying commercial planes since the start of the pandemic to keep up with legal requirements and be sufficiently resilient to resume their jobs without retraining.Separately, hundreds are believed to have taken early retirement, with many others switching careers due to a lack of work during the virus crisis. Others have switched to part-time work in what could become a permanent move for many.Mr Chalk, who was a pilot for 27 years, said: I have only reached my mid-50s, but I took early retirement last summer because a voluntary redundancy package was being offered.There will be other people who have either been furloughed or made redundant and will have gone back to a previous career or picked up a new career – so an unknown number of us will not fly again.We have a large number of pilots out of work but, as things speed up and airlines seek to recruit, there is a concern that we might go from a position where we had over-supply of pilots to one where actually sufficient have left the profession that we end up with a shortfall. There is a feeling that, next summer, there may be a shortage of pilots.Addressing the number of pilots who will require additional training and flying time before they can transport commercial passengers again, Mr Chalk said: We are calling on the Government to help airlines re-skill and reinvest in resilience so that particularly next spring, as the work ramps up as we hope it will, there are actually the crew there to fly.Balpa is requesting government funding for resilience training for pilots grounded during the pandemic, on the basis that airlines\u0027 finances have already been devastated by the pandemic.Separately, ministers are funding skills bootcamps for people seeing to become HGV drivers amid a shortage of trained workers in the haulage industry.An analysis by consultancy firm Oliver Wyman, drawn up earlier this year, said: The most important question is not whether a pilot shortage will re-emerge, but when it will occur and how large the gap will be between supply and demand.Based on a modest recovery scenario, we believe a global pilot shortage will emerge in certain regions no later than 2023 and most probably before.

It’s the right thing to do. Those he saved and their relatives want to leave this world knowing that the person who rescued them will be honoured forever.”Among those Col Kendrick helped escape the Nazis include people who became household names in Britain after the war, such as the publisher, Lord George Weidenfeld, pianist Peter Stadlen, lawyer Hans Schick and psychologist and activist Trude Holmes. He is also believed to have helped Sigmund Freud, the Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis, escape the country.Fresh documentary evidence about how Col Kendrick helped 2,000 Jews flee to Rhodesia and Kenya has also been sent to Yad Vashem.However, Dr Fry believes she has also unveiled a royal link to the spy “that can now be placed on record”. She discovered that Countess Marianne Szapary - the mother of HRH Princess Michael of Kent who lived in Czechoslovakia - was actually working on the side of the British for Col Kendrick and MI6.Controversy has surrounded HRH’s Princess Michael’s father, Günther von Reibnitz, who was an SS officer, causing great difficulty for the family.Yet she claims that it can now be revealed - via “a source who cannot be named, but it has been verified as true” - that Princess Michael’s mother was in fact working for MI6 in the 1930s and 1940s.“It is now felt behind the scenes that HRH and her brother and family, and the public, should now know that their mother worked on the side of the British,” Dr Fry said.Col Kendrick was posted to Vienna in 1925 as an SIS station chief and ran a sophisticated spy network across Europe, feeding intelligence back to the Foreign Office under the cover of being the passport control officer at the British Consulate in Vienna.However, in 1938, when the Third Reich annexed Austria, the country’s 200,000 Jews were no longer safe.“Kendrick faced a human catastrophe of immeasurable proportions,” the book says. “Many of his Jewish friends were now at risk. The massive volume of applications from Jews seeking to emigrate was something for which the passport office was ill prepared.In the coming weeks and months he and his staff would be pushed to breaking point. Kendrick embarked on the path of a rescuer becoming the Oskar Schindler of Vienna.”He helped to process up to 175 passport applications a day, and, when that was not enough, he issued fake passports and permits to help Jews flee the country.Eventually, Col Kendrick and his wife were forced to flee Vienna for Britain after being betrayed to the Gestapo by a double agent.The spy never spoke about what he had done after the war.More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannot afford overlook energy doorstep","story":"If only we had some gas reserves of our own. Perhaps then we wouldn’t rely quite so heavily on pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands, or on refrigerated ships bringing liquified natural gas from Qatar. Perhaps then millions of households wouldn’t be facing a chilly winter as wholesale gas prices surge, inflating domestic bills by up to 30 per cent. Oh, hang on a minute.Our energy debate has become so fixated on renewables that we have almost forgotten the North Sea, and the vast quantities of untapped shale gas lying below our shores. Not that much will be available to save UK households from soaring bills this winter. As global gas prices spiked to record levels last week, few noticed that the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning – a Department for Business quango that grants licenses for extraction in the North Sea – rejected an application from Shell to exploit its Jackdaw field, 150 miles off Aberdeen.Shell’s management has expressed surprise, but is it really any wonder? There’s a clue in the quango’s name, which says nothing about promoting energy security - merely scrapping existing infrastructure. At some point Greenpeace snuck into government when we weren’t looking, and our North Sea strategy became ‘leave it in the ground’.That might work, were our renewable sources of energy ready to take over, but they emphatically aren’t. Ministers often chirp that 43 per cent of our electricity generation came from renewables in 2020, more than that generated by fossil fuels. What you are less likely to hear is that renewables accounted for just 13.6 per cent of total energy consumption in 2020 – and two thirds of this came from burning woodchips, biogas and waste, all of which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By some calculations they are even filthier than coal. Meanwhile wind and solar met less than four per cent of our total energy requirements.We would all love clean energy, but it seems inescapable that however quickly we try to grapple with wind and solar intermittency we will remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels for years to come. And while it is necessary, why don’t we use our own fossil fuels rather than importing them? The North Sea is not as depleted as many believe – it still produces about 40 per cent of our gas. But there is plenty more we could extract if we were prepared to open new fields, many of which, like Jackdaw, could piggyback on existing pipelines and other infrastructure. Then there is shale, which, thanks to a few barely-detectable minor tremors, seems to have lost even the lukewarm support the Cameron government afforded it. Failing to exploit this energy is not ‘environmental’ it simply makes us more dependent on imported fuels and further exposes us to gyrations in global energy markets.Making the most of a bad situation, ministers last week tried to argue that the ongoing energy crisis shows why we must move even more rapidly towards wind and solar - freeing ourselves from overseas dependence. A more reasoned analysis would conclude that we should instead be turning to our own oil and gas.  More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new theory claims covid 19 may have evolved chinese mineworker","story":"The origins of the Covid-19 pandemic are still unknown, with many scientists now openly discussing whether the virus was engineered, or leaked from a Wuhan lab.But a new theory gives an entirely different explanation.Dr Jonathan Latham, the executive director of the US Bioscience Resource Project, believes that Covid-19 may have evolved in the body of an infected Chinese mineworker nearly a decade before the pandemic began.Crucially, samples of the puzzling miner’s disease were sent to viral researchers in Wuhan for study, from where they may have escaped into the population, he argues.Dr Latham says the emergence of the Alpha variant in Kent last Autumn proves that the virus can make strange evolutionary leaps and quickly develop large numbers of mutations when inside an inidual for a long time.Earlier this year, Cambridge University concluded that the super-infectious Alpha variant probably evolved in a single immunocompromised patient who had the disease for many months.Speaking at a BMJ webinar on the origins of the pandemic, Dr Latham said: “The theory requires many hundreds of mutations in one miner to turn into Sars-Cov-2. Decades were crammed into about six months.“But we have heard of the surprising phenomenon of isolated cases of greatly accelerated evolution in viruses in Britain. As much evolution occurred in that one inidual in England as had occurred in the millions of other infections.“Our theory proposes that a similar evolution was happening inside the lungs of miners following the mystery disease in 2012 and argues that the virus leaked from a medical sample obtained from the miners infected by the outbreak.”Back in 2012, six miners who were shovelling bat guano in the Tongguan mineshaft in Mojiang, Yunnan, became seriously ill with a pneumonia-like illness that bore a striking similarity to Covid-19. Three of them died and the others were hospitalised for up to six months.A Chinese researcher who investigated the deaths for his master’s thesis concluded they were probably infected by a Sars-like coronavirus originating in horseshoe bats.Just a year after the deaths, Wuhan scientists discovered a virus named RaTG13 in the same caves, which was later found to be a 96 per cent match for Covid-19, but must have erged 40 years earlier.However, the new theory suggests that the evolution from a virus such as RaTG13 could have occurred far more quickly inside the body of a miner.“We know that coronaviruses were erse and abundant near the mine, and we know that some of the miners underwent lengthy hospitalisations,” added Dr Latham.“Their treatment lasted six months and allowed the evolution of novel adapted human coronaviruses.“We know many medical samples were sent to the Wuhan institute of Virology, so the question is,what was in the samples, and what was done with any viruses that were found?”Scientists investigating the origin of the pandemic have repeatedly asked for details of virus sequences housed and studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But a database containing details of the samples was taken offline shortly before the pandemic began.Alison Young, the Hurley Chair in Public Affairs Reporting at the Missouri School of Journalism, also told the webinar that lab leaks of dangerous viruses were common throughout the world, and had previously led to outbreaks.“One of the arguments is that lab experiments are extremely rare events,” she said. “Lab accidents are not rare. In the US in 2020 there were 134 reported lab exposure incidences of viruses, bacteria and toxins that the US government regulates.“Lab accidents and exposures happen frequently.”She pointed to the 2007 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England which occurred after sewage leaked from an Institute for Animal Health (IAH) lab at Pirbright in Surrey as well as leaks of the original Sars virus in China. But she said many lab leaks went unreported.“Laboratories do not like making their leaks public,” she added.French genome analyst Dr Jacques van Helden, who recently co-authored a letter in the Lancet calling for an objective debate on the origins of Covid-19, said new regulation was needed to stop labs from doing work that could spark a pandemic.“I want to understand what really happened and so far I don’t think we have the answer,” he said.“We need to revise our internal regulations. Irrespective of the origin of this virus we know there are several labs doing experiments of concern because they are generating viruses that are potential pandemics.”His views were also echoed this week by Kevin Esvelt of MIT, who helped invent gene drive technology.Writing on Twitter, Dr Esvelt said: “It doesn\u0027t matter whether it actually came from a lab - mere plausibility is enough. No nuclear warhead could kill as many people as Sars-CoV-2.“Pandemic virus discovery equals disseminating blueprints for nuke-equivalents accessible to iniduals.

The Blue Period canvas hangs in the politan Museum in New York and is hailed as one of his most important works following its completion in 1903.Scholars had known of the earlier work as it appears as an unfinished painting in the background of his famous painting, La Vie (The Life) of 1903, an enigmatic composition of figures in his studio, on display in the Cleveland Museum of Art.Art historians had searched in vain for the crouching woman until x-rays revealed that it lies beneath The Blind Man’s Meal and that Picasso had reused the canvas, perhaps because he was then so poor and canvas was a luxury.Neuroscientist Anthony Bourached and physicist George Cann, both PhD candidates at UCL, used x-rays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 3D-printing to recreate the lost painting.Analysing Picasso’s brushstrokes in other paintings, they trained an algorithm to simulate how the original painting looked. The pair told how they hoped the recreation would ensure Picasso\u0027s hidden treasure would not be erased from history.Mr Cann, whose main focus is analysing trace gases in the Martian atmosphere, said: “It’s very exciting to see a work that’s been locked up.It’s quite eerie seeing the brushstrokes, the colour and the way in which light reflects off the work. It’s a very beautiful piece.”He added: “I hope Picasso would be happy in knowing the treasure he\u0027s hidden for future generations is finally being revealed, 48 years after his death and 118 years after the painting was concealed. I also hope that the woman within the portrait would be happy in knowing that she hadn\u0027t been erased from history and that her beauty was finally being revealed in the 21st century.”Mr Bourached, a specialist in high-dimensional neuroscience, trying to model human behaviour through AI, said: “Picasso likely painted over this piece with reluctance.It was common for his blue period work as it was early in his career and materials were expensive… Its appearance in the background of one of his most famous Blue Period pieces, La Vie, indicates that it was likely significant to him.”The recreated painting will be unveiled at the Morf Gallery in London on Oct 13, part of the capital’s first Deeep AI art festival.http:www.deeep.artIn 1901, aged 21, desperately poor and depressed by the suicide of a close friend, the artist began to create melancholic paintings, finding inspiration in society’s outcasts, with blind and lonely beggars among his subjects.The Blind Man\u0027s Meal is considered one of his most important Blue Period canvases, in which the ritual of tasting bread and wine evokes the flesh and blood of Christ in contemporary terms. Picasso wrote to a friend: “I am painting a blind man at the table. He holds a piece of bread in his left hand and with his right hand reaches for a jug of wine.”The scientists are rediscovering hidden paintings on canvases that were reused by artists, who were perhaps too impoverished to buy supplies or who were simply unhappy with those compositions. Thousands of such artworks are concealed from the naked eye beneath layers of paint.In earlier experiments of the “NeoMasters” project, conducted through a company called Oxia Palus, they recreated a woman’s portrait that lies beneath Amedeo Modigliani’s Portrait of a Girl of 1917 in the Tate. X-rays revealed another painting beneath The Blind Man’s Meal in 2010 during a Picasso exhibition in New York.Gary Tinterow, a leading Picasso expert and director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, curated the major Picasso exhibition of 2010 at the politan Museum of Art when the x-ray revealed the crouching woman behind The Blind Man’s Meal.On seeing a photograph of the recreated crouching woman, he said: “It’s fascinating - not so much because of what it shows us - but because of what it doesn’t show us. As a Picasso scholar, I’d rather look at the x-ray because, in the x-ray, every mark is by Picasso, whereas in this visual AI reconstruction, there’s a lot of information there which does not ring true to Picasso.”But David G Stork, a visiting lecturer at Stanford University in California, who specialises in using computers and AI for studying art and who has collaborated with these two scientists, said: “The blue figure has been captured in a way that really captures emotion. This is not a mere scientific exercise. The technology is good enough that we can recover emotion and mood from a real artistic genius.”More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should classical liberals abandon hope conservative party","story":"You can call this government a lot of things: tax-grabbing, dirigiste, profligate. What you can’t call it is unconservative. Boris Johnson professes a remarkably conventional Tory creed: patriotic and paternalistic pro-business and pro-spending. His approach would have been immediately recognisable to Disraeli, Baldwin, Churchill, Macmillan or Heath.Margaret Thatcher was and remains the outlier. The idea that loyalty to her memory would one day be regarded as a measure of Tory orthodoxy would have surprised her every bit as much as her One Nation detractors. To the end, she saw herself as, in a sense, an opponent of her own government, a lonely radical struggling to get her reforms past a pessimistic and statist establishment. And she had a point. Her MPs put up with her while she was winning, but turned on her the moment she stumbled.By then, of course, her remedies had been shown to work. Britain, which had had the slowest-growing economy in Western Europe in the 1970s, had the second-fastest in the 1980s (only Spain, coming back from a still lower place, grew faster). Even Labour had to accept that freer competition, lighter regulation and lower taxes made people better off. But neither Labour nor the Tory wets ever really grasped why Thatcherism worked. Their attitude to the lady’s economic legacy was like that of savage tribesmen towards an artefact bequeathed by a higher civilization – respectful but uncomprehending.Thatcher’s brand of Manchester liberalism never colonised the Conservative Party. At best, it formed a contingent alliance with mainstream Toryism – an unequal alliance, it should be added, for the free-marketeers were always the minority. Thatcher was like a mahout on the back of a massive elephant. The beast was moved by its own instincts – patriotism, religious faith, respect for hierarchy, distaste for indecency, unease about social change. A skilled rider could coax it, whisper in its vast ear, nudge it this way or that. But only up to a point. Thatcher knew better than to jab her goad too harshly. In every year that she was prime minister, for example, there was a net rise in public expenditure – although, overall, the economy grew faster than the government.How did she come to scramble onto the shoulders of that great beast in the first place? After all, conservatism and liberalism had traditionally been the two opposed poles of our party system, mutually repellent down the centuries, whether as the Conservative and Liberal Parties, the Tories and the Whigs or even, in some ways, the Cavaliers and the Roundheads.What pushed them together after three antagonistic centuries was the rise of socialism. Confronted at home with a Labour Party bent on expropriation, and abroad by the Red Army, conservatives and liberals buried their differences. In Western Europe, where there were proportional voting systems, they generally remained in separate and competing parties, though often as coalition partners. But in the Anglosphere, where first-past-the-post encouraged a two-party system, they had to find ways to combine.In the United States, party identities had been as much about regional loyalties as anything else, but a more coherent Right began to take shape in the 1950s. The realignment was driven by William F Buckley, the brilliant, handsome, charismatic editor of the National Review, who believed that constitutionalists, patriots, libertarians, Christians and others must stand together against the Soviet menace. This notion became known as “fusionism” and, though it had its critics (the mighty conservative intellectual Russell Kirk used to argue that he had even less in common with libertarians than he had with socialists), it worked, paving the way for Ronald Reagan’s ascendancy.Something similar happened in Britain at the same time. Ralph Harris, the founder of the Institute of Economic Affairs, told me shortly before he died that he and his fellow free-marketeers had faced a momentous decision after the obliteration of the Liberal Party in the 1950 election. Some had wanted to withdraw from politics, reading papers to each other at the Mont Pelerin Society and preserving the purity of their doctrines, like Irish monks painstakingly copying illuminated manuscripts through the Dark Ages. But Harris was not interested in ideas that could not be implemented. The cheerful pipe-smoker argued that freedom-lovers must seek to capture at least one of the two potential parties of government.The Conservative Party of that era was patrician, imperialist and acquiescent in the creation of Attlee’s state monoliths. So Harris and his colleagues set to work convincing some of its up-and-coming MPs: Enoch Powell, Geoffrey Howe, Nick Ridley and, most consequentially, Keith Joseph, who became Thatcher’s John the Baptist. The British version of fusionism, mixing economic liberalism with cultural conservatism, proved every bit as electorally successful as the American. The Conservatives governed for 18 years.Today, on both sides of the Atlantic, that alliance is fraying. Without the Red Menace to hold it in place, the compound is separating out into its constituent elements – and, as before, the liberals are by far the smaller. The speed with which US Republicans have moved from Reaganism to Trumpery, from laissez-faire to aggressive populism, from free trade to tariffs, is staggering.We classical liberals were few enough before 2020. The median voter was always to our Left on economic issues and to our Right on cultural ones. As is often pointed out, the political centre of gravity in Britain is “fund the NHS, hang the paedos”.The epidemic has made us even more of a minority. Around the world, people are more frightened and therefore more authoritarian. Week after week, as I railed on this page against the severity of the lockdown, I sensed that I was swimming against the current. I now have the same feeling when I argue for private enterprise and lower taxes.Almost all the interventions now being decreed are popular. More money for the NHS and social care, fewer immigrants and higher wages, subsidies to keep us heated through the winter, nationalised railways, taxes on business – all poll well. It is only when their consequences become clear that the mood will turn and even then, it will turn against the government as a whole rather than against the inidual policies that caused the mess.Higher expenditure means slower growth and therefore, in the long term, lower revenues. Higher wages without commensurate increases in productivity mean more inflation. More fuel subsidies mean a worse deficit and a slower recovery. Nationalised railways (have we already forgotten?) mean dirtier and less reliable trains. Taxes on business mean fewer jobs.Even two years ago, I would have felt silly writing that last paragraph. Why repeat such obvious truths? But we have moved, in a stunningly short time, to a media climate in which it is considered good economics to decree higher wages, in the manner of some 1920s Latin American caudillo ordering double salaries for everyone.Do we truly not understand where prices and incomes policies will lead? Some of us are old enough to remember the 1970s, but we seem relaxed about going through it all again – rising inflation, an energy crisis, nationalisations, even Abba. Perhaps we need, as before, to hit rock bottom before we reach for the right remedies.Understandably, in the circumstances, some free-marketeers are wondering whether they should step aside and stop pretending to have anything in common with big government conservatives. Why implicate themselves in a crisis being caused by policies they fundamentally oppose?The answer is that the logic of fusionism has not gone away. In the middle years of the twentieth century, conservatives and liberals were alike menaced by revolutionary socialism today, they are alike menaced by the fanaticism of identity politics.Then, the threat came from Soviet MiGs today it comes from Chinese cyberattacks. In both cases, the Western civilisation that incubated the conservative and liberal traditions is in peril. For classical liberals to give up on the conservative coalition would be fundamentally self-indulgent. It would mean removing the last constraints on government, and ensuring that the debt and inflation crises are needlessly exacerbated. It would mean withdrawing into electoral irrelevance.Perhaps voters are not yet in the mood for liberty. Perhaps we small government types are still at the Keith Joseph rather than the Margaret Thatcher stage. But when we do eventually turn things around, it will be as part of a broad alliance capable of winning and exercising power. We have no right to walk away now.More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"universities have moral duty defend dissident academics like","story":"What an almighty relief it was to hear Adam Tickell, the Vice Chancellor of Sussex University on the Today Programme last week, defending his staff members’ “untrammelled right to say and believe what they think”. It is a depressing sign of the times that even this most basic defence of academic freedom feels unusual.Tickell’s intervention may be too little, too late, but it should be a much needed wake-up call to his spineless colleagues. It follows a campaign of intimidation against Professor Kathleen Stock, a lecturer who has published widely on the philosophy of aesthetics, fiction and imagination. Yet it is her views on gender theory that have led horrifically to events which now involve the police. Stickers calling her a “transphobic s---” surfaced in her workplace. An Instagram account called ‘Anti Terf Sussex’ was set up, with the demand “Fire Kathleen Stock. Otherwise you’ll see us around.” Masked protesters lit flares, and flew banners reading “Stock out”. She has endured this kind of harassment for two years at least. Whatever your opinion on the trans debate, does anyone believe that a respected female academic should be treated this way?Stock is just one of many under threat, yet numerous universities have apparently been cowed into silence. It is no coincidence that those targeted most tend to be women with ‘gender-critical’ views - who believe, along with most of the population, that sex is a biological reality. By refusing to kowtow to the idea that gender is simply a feeling that can be changed by self-declaration, they are smeared as “transphobes” and relentlessly bullied.In Stock’s book Material Girls, she reiterates that trans people deserve to be safe and “visible throughout society without shame or stigma”, She makes a point of using students’ “preferred pronouns”, writing “I would never discriminate against any student for any aspect of their identity, including being trans”. (As a lesbian, Stock probably knows a fair bit about discrimination). She sees her role not to convince students of her own beliefs but to encourage open discussion - a view all academics ought to share.Now this very attitude seems under threat. What is shocking about Stock’s case (and cases like it such as Selina Todd at Oxford University and Rosa Freeman at Reading) is their unions’ utter failure to defend them - and their colleagues’ complicity in denouncing them. No wonder Stock told me that lockdown had provided some relief from her overwhelmingly toxic working environment. Who, exactly, is being protected here? If the views of one woman make people in another building feel “unsafe” while that woman is visibly intimidated, then what does ‘safety’ mean?The no-platforming, the disinviting, the sheer animosity towards anyone challenging the dominant narrative - all this is the antithesis to education. The government, recognising the threat, proposed the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill. The Left branded it a cynical attempt to promote conservative thought.It is not that simple. Surveys show that students of many political persuasions feel unable to voice their views. The combination of universities seeking to pacify students in a market where they are seen as “consumers” - along with ‘safe spaces’ and other ideas drawn from US campuses, have created an unreal world where no student may be disturbed by a view that bursts their bubble. Legislation is a blunt and unsatisfactory instrument. It is this “no debate” culture and the accompanying self-censorship that must change.Closing down discussion in the name of “inclusion” produces nothing but silence and mediocre intellectual work. Universities have a moral duty to defend academic freedom and dissident thought or we end up with no freedom and no thought at all, held to ransom by unthinking thugs. More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"university pays students 15 hour decolonise curriculum","story":"Students are being paid almost £15 an hour to be “critical readers” in a decolonisation trawl of a Russell Group university’s courses.The University of Edinburgh is hiring students part-time to review course materials and curricula “through the lenses of equality, ersity, inclusion, and decolonisation”.They will be paid £14.66 per hour and work six hours a week within one of the 16th century university’s most prestigious faculties, literatures, languages and cultures.The recruits will report to academics on the faculty’s board of studies to help ersify courses such as English literature and foreign languages, focusing on issues such as race, gender, sexuality and disability.An internal job advert for the posts, seen by The , says applicants must “have an interest in decolonising the curriculum” and “a strong commitment to equality, ersity and inclusion”, with these listed under the “essential” specifications. Experience of campaigning is listed as “desirable”.Last night scholars criticised the move as an attempt to “institutionalise censorship” by lending credence to “activist students”.The students will receive training before embarking on “reading and reviewing” course materials during November and December. The pilot project is funded through the Principal’s Teaching Award Scheme which receives donations from alumni and the public.One Edinburgh academic, who wished to remain anonymous, told The : “The connotations of this are fairly clear, undergraduate students may be in a position to be paid to vet and \u0027decolonise\u0027 curricula proposed by the academics they\u0027re supposedly meant to be learning from.“Universities already throw a gauntlet of reviews at academics trying to run courses without activist students getting their say.”The academic also expressed concern that tutors on similar pay scales in Russian history may face being “answerable” to English literature students “with little to no knowledge” of their subject.Prof Frank Furedi, a sociologist at Kent University, added: “It tries to institutionalise censorship - there’s already that disposition to shut down discussion and now they’re giving people money for it.”It forms part of intensifying decolonisation efforts at the institution, which has created a steering group to identify “controversial elements of the university’s past” so that “reparatory recommendations” can be made.Computer science lecturers have been urged not to use the “Western” names Alice and Bob in informatics terminology, while the David Hume Tower was renamed after activists surfaced remarks the enlightenment philosopher uttered in the 18th century.Earlier this year, Edinburgh academics revolted to call for the university’s principal, Prof Peter Mathieson, to resign. They alleged that an “intolerant and illiberal” culture had taken root after one scholar was investigated over “problematic” views.While Edinburgh is thought to be the first to pay student critical readers, last year the University of Sheffield hired students on £9.34 an hour to monitor and challenge so-called “micro-aggressions” on campus.An Edinburgh University spokesman said it was “committed to addressing contemporary and historic inequalities” and the students would “explore how the school’s current curriculum can engage students robustly, rigorously, and inclusively”.More from NewsJournals launch ‘citation justice’ to make academics include ‘erse’ races and genders in footnotesBoris Johnson and wife Carrie on first foreign holiday since their marriageBoris Johnson faces fresh Brexit clash with judgesMet Police \u0026#39ordered child abuse detectives to caution innocent people to hit targets\u0026#39Undemocratic and unsustainable, theMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"generous tories help poor taking","story":":root Generous Tories help the poor by taking money off them as the wealthy hide trillionsThe cut seems especially generous because the wealthiest people are hiding £.trillion in tax havens where they dodge the rules to avoid paying taxNadine Dorries helpfully explained: What were doing it giving people a step out Image: Getty ImagesopinionByMark Steel:,  Oct | commentsThis week the extra payment of £ Universal Credit, introduced during the pandemic, was cut again. The Government said it was only a temporary measure, because you can’t expect the poor to eat permanently. Minister Nadine Dorries helpfully explained: “What we’re doing is giving people a step out.” It’s always a sign of generosity, to help the poor step out by taking money off them. That’s why you see so many people lying in shop doorways, shouting “can you take a few coins off me please, mate. I’ve got nearly two quid to last me the week, please take it away so I can step out”. It’s the same when a crackhead robs  quid from a pensioner. The robbers are simply helping them not to rely on their pension, and to step out to towards self-reliance by having to eat cat food for the week.  The cut seems especially generous because the other financial news is that the wealthiest people in the world are hiding £.trillion in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, where they dodge the rules to avoid paying tax. So there’s an obvious way to make the world fair. The poorest people in Britain must be allowed to set up a benefits haven. Anyone should be allowed to claim as many benefits as they like, as long as all the money is sent to the Isle of Wight, where the rules are relaxed. So you can receive unemployment benefit while doing a window cleaning round, as long as the windows are registered in Ventnor.  Cleaners will be able to claim Universal Credit without mentioning their earnings on the application,their bucket and sponges have a residence in a cupboard on the ferry from Portsmouth. Campaigners will protest against this obvious theft, but the Government can say they can’t be too hard on benefit cheats or they’ll move abroad and fiddle a dferent country, which will be a huge loss to our economy. You’ll be able to claim disability benefit, saying that you can’t move because your neck is broken in  places eventhere’s nothing wrong with it, as long as the neck is registered on Shanklin pier. Specialist accountants will find loopholes in the law that state this is perfectly legal providing the neck is in the Isle of Wight for  days a year. So claimants will have to visit each year, and the island will be transformed into a giant playground for benefit cheats. A massive harbour will be built in Sandown, where benefit cheats will spend their summer relaxing on the decks of their pedalos and sipping lager before flaunting their wealth in the amusement arcades. Sometimes it will be reported that a woman from St Helens has claimed for  babies that don’t exist, but her financial advisor will reply that they were all registered as living in the theme park at Blackgang Chine, so no law has been broken. She’ll donate £million to a party that supports benefit cheats, and the world will be fair at last.

During the wide-ranging interview, the -year-old father-of-one also opened up about his turbulent childhood, which almost included him and his siblings being taken into care after mum Mary was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The MP said he has faced mental health struggle which only became clear to him when a local councillor urged him to seek support. He said: It was an important moment, actually, because I thought, this is visible to other people. Iaposm clearly not happy. My Coyle said he appeared to be completely ing and was out and about in parliament, but the atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as the aftermath of the Brexit vote played out.  Things came to a head when his home, which he shares with his we and young daughter Esme, was targeted. He said: I had somebody break the window, my home, my bedroom window home during the Brexit debate. He added: There’s no way out the back, it’s a brick wall. So, I was sat with a cricket bat in case they came through. The MP said he needed help from therapists in the weeks and months ahead as the massive stress took a toll. He said: Iaposve had bouts of depression and things, but I have CBT . I think that when Jo was murdered, it triggered lots... that was a very dficult time. Mr Coyle, who grew up in Luton alongside two brothers and a sister, said his childhood was very dficult but, in the end, helped him to build emotional resilience.  He said his motheraposs mental health deteriorated when his father left. He said: Sadly, some of my earliest memories are the most dficult. There was a time where mum set fire to the living room carpet because she was trying to keep us warm. There was no intent to damage or harm anybody or the property. We used to have the coin meter. People donapost see them anymore, so they find it hard to understand - but I donapost know whether she didnapost have any money to work the heating system. I donapost know whether her mental health had collapsed so badly that she just didnapost know how to do it - but she set fire to the carpet. Mary was previously a primary school teacher and ran a drop-in club for kids, but her mental state crumbled very badly and she was eventually sectioned. Mr Coyle revealed how this occurred again recently, but she only got help after she crashed her car into a bollard. While no-one was hurt, a psychiatric assessment was ordered, he said. Mr Coyle said: It was only because she was in the criminal justice system that the magistrate was able to order a psychiatric assessment, and thataposs what got her back into mental healthcare, which is crazy. The system is crazy, not people. The MP added that he was grateful that as a youngster he wasnapost taken into local authority care He said: My nan was integral to keeping us togetheroutcomes for children in care in those days were dramatically worse than they are now, and theyaposre still very poor for many children.Comment MORE ON Labour PartyAsdaMental healthSocial servicesCrimeDangerous drivingCar crashesPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As a Northerner from a working-class background, I appreciate the sentiment. I’m usually grateful when someone highlights the lack of working-class voices wherever it may be – but not this time. Growing up on a Bradford council estate, I never imagined myself walking through the BBC’s lush London offices. But I have and I’m proud to say I never felt out of place. I started working on a science documentary at BBC Studios in June this year as a Junior Researcher and I only left last week. Granted, it wasn’t a long spell compared to many there, so my words don’t stem from years of long-enduring loyalty. But my experience was enough to know that I wholeheartedly disagree with Nadine.Do you agree with Tammieaposs comments  Have your say in the comment section below. My BBC bosses offered me a longer contract to stay. I wasn’t pressured to move to London from Bradford even though my production was London-based. They even paid for my train and hotel when I wanted to visit the office. According to Nadine, “ you’ve got a regional accent at the BBC, it doesn’t go down particularly well” - my colleagues from Glasgow, Oldham and Huddersfield might disagree with that. Her comment made me chuckle nevertheless. I, with my strong Yorkshire accent, was hired by an Executive Producer with an even stronger Northern accent. From Barrow-In-Furness to be exact, where he worked as a submarine painter. Nadine also claimed that the BBC is “staffed by people whose mum and dad worked there”.  I disagree, as does Faye Harland of BBC Radio Berkshire who told her Twitter followers that in her -year career at the BBC that she’s “worked with one person who was following in a parent’s footsteps. ONE.” Similarly, Mastermind host Clive Myrie added to the discussion explaining that his mum was a seamstress. But Nadine underestimates the public. We all know that she employed her daughters using public money, as The Mirror discovered back in . She’s trying hard to be relatable but unfortunately just comes across as a hypocrite. The media is a ridiculously competitive industry and it’s primarily a case of ‘who you know’. But Nadine’s accusations against the BBC - I’d even call it a vendetta, miss the wider issue completely and that’s dangerous for us working-class folk. There are many media companies out there guilty of nepotism but she’s completely firing at the wrong target. It’s an industry-wide problem not a BBC one. She’s let her extreme personal bias show. Why did she never throw ITV under the bus  Is she still sentimental from her time on “I’m a Celebrity…”  If Nadine claims she’s a working-class Northerner, why do I feel like I have nothing in common with her  I like to think I’m proof of an industry changing for the better. Nadine needs to refocus her accusations. Don’t look at me though, my parents are shopkeepers.Tammie Ash is part of the New Writing North’s Writing Chance programme. @NewWritingNorthComment MORE ON Nadine DorriesFurness NVITVBBC Studios and Post Production Ltd.DocumentariesMastermind\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In total, Sir Geoffrey has made almost a million pounds in outside earnings since August  - working an average of  hours a week. Yet he charges £, a month - £, a year - to the taxpayer to pay his rent. The latest published records show he declared payments for  hours of work for two law firms, to take place between June and December this year. In total, the Torridge and West Devon MP was paid £, for the work - almost £, more than his annual salary as an MP.At this weekaposs Tory conference in Manchester, Boris Johnson claimed he had no alternative but to end the £ a week uplt of Universal Credit.  Echoing the phrase used by Margaret Thatcher, he insisted the cut is right because taxpayers should not subsidise low pay. Based on his outside earning, it would take Sir Geoffrey  seconds to make £. Labour MP Andrew Gwynne said: “It’s grotesque that we live in a country where a Conservative MP can earn in one minute what his own government has just taken from millions of families through the £ cut to Universal Credit.You donapost turn on the poorest as you come out of a pandemic and that’s why Labour would cancel the cut.”  It comes just days after fellow Tory Sir Peter Bottomley called for MPs to get a pay rise, claiming some younger members find it really grim to live on a salary of almost £,. The median salary in the UK is just over £,, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sir Peter, Parliamentaposs oldest sitting MP, claimed members should be paid as much as a GP - around £, on average in the UK.

That is despite think tanks putting the worst-case estimate at around , to , people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas said the cut risks moving , people including , children below the poverty line. While the Legatum Institute think tank, led by Tory UC architect Baroness Stroud, says the change will hit , Brits who are currently just above the poverty line - including , children. But ministers have no official figure for how many people will be thrown into poverty because they’ve refused to do a formal impact assessment. And questioned by left-wing journalist Owen Jones at the Tory conference, Ms Dorries said: “Nobody. Nobody is.  “No no no, because, no Owen of course not. “Because what we’re doing, what we’re doing is giving people a step out. “By letime skills guarantee, by all the money being invested in the…” - she then walked away with an aide. Analysis by the JRF has found more than , working-age families in Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire constituency will be affected by the cut to UC and Tax Credits. That includes % of all working-age families with childrenand % of all working-age families without children . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “These comments show just how far away the Conservative Party is from the real world. “Charities and foodbanks have been warning for months that taking £, away from millions of families in the midst of a Conservative cost of living crisis will push children into poverty.” The cut officially began yesterday and will kick into payments from next Wednesday. Read more Boris Johnson did not mention it once in his -minute conference speech which was peppered with jokes.Katie Schmuecker of the JRF said yesterday: “The Prime Minister has not had the guts to look the millions of people whose incomes are being cut today in the eye and tell them how they are expected to get through the year ahead. “The Prime Minister’s attempt to strike an upbeat tone is completely at odds with the despair people are feeling and the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was asked the same question as Ms Dorries by Owen Jones. She replied: “Well it was always a temporary uplt, and that’s why no impact assessment was done when we knew it was temporary. “We are investing in the plan for jobs, we’ve also got the household support fund… we want to try and see what’s going on, what it is we can to help people with the skills so they can absolutely take advantage of higher-paid jobs.” Comment MORE ON Nadine DorriesOwen JonesJonathan ReynoldsBoris JohnsonConservative PartyPensionspovertyPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Explaining how Kev found the ring, Rachel added: He literally spent over and hour pulling out loads of junk and mud and putting it into bags and buckets with his bare hands! All the customers were watching his every move hoping and praying for me. He then spent half an hour washing and going through it all again with his bare hands.  He was so kind and patient and never gave up looking for me. The ring was no where to be seen. I was convinced Iaposd lost it forever I was ready to have a breakdown. However in his very last handful of mud there was my ring. He has no idea how much he made my day. I was so so lucky that he managed to find it for me. Literally in tears now when I think it over. He is an absolute legend and really does deserves every praise possible. I will never ever take my rings off again, nor will I ever look at a carrot cake again the same.

Image: Liverpool Echo Lydia EllenByAbigail Nicholson:,  Oct | commentsA confused student was left wondering why she was told she aposdidnapost existapos after receiving Ancestry DNA kit results. Lydia Ellen, who asked to only be referred to by her first and middle name, asked her mum for her medical records ahead of moving to university in Southampton. But after seeing her vaccination certicate she noticed her MMR jab – usually given at around -months-old – was dated as having been administered in July . Lydia was born in May , so couldnapost possibly have received her jab on that date.The -year-old told the Liverpool Echo : I was very very confused. I asked my parents and they were just as confused, as obviously my mum would know when I was born and vaccinated because they had me and took me for them.There was nothing that ever made me question my ageIaposm honest. Most people always thought I was younger than I was. I thought it must be an innocent mistake.  A few years later Lydia got herself an Ancestry DNA test for her birthday after becoming curious about her ethnicity and family. Her results showed % of her genetic make-up can be traced back to England and north-west Europe, with North West England featuring prominently in her results. Merseyside and the Wirral Peninsula were highlighted as particular areas of importance for Lydiaaposs genealogy. But she was left aposshockedapos and aposconfusedapos after trying to start her family tree. Lydia said: I donapost have a very big family so wanted to find out more. I obtained my results, saying my origins are mostly from the UK, however, when I went to type my name and date of birth into Ancestry to start off my family tree, it stated there was no one with my name and birth date on record, only people with my name with a dferent birth date. There was no one with my name and date of birth existing.  The student took to TikTok and began questioning who she was. Lydia was told her vaccination records are a simple mistake and said she can only assume Ancestry was wrong because they have few records on her. She said: I figured out that the vaccination records are a simple mistake, were mis-written or not written clearly. Regarding Ancestry, I can only assume itaposs because they have very few records on me because I havenapost moved, got married, died, etc. We donapost know where my birth certicate is currently, but Iaposd imagine I mustaposve seen it before at some point or it mustaposve been used.  Weaposve examined other records that line up with my birth date. Iaposve had no trouble obtaining legal documents however. After sharing her story to her , followers on TikTok Lydia was aposoverwhelmedapos by the response and even found other people who had been through the same thing. Lydia, from Cheshire, said: Iaposve had an overwhelming response, sadly lots of hate... however, there have been a handful of people say that the same has happened to them. Iaposve even had some people try and work out who I am by delving into records and even missing peopleaposs cases.

John Wesley Evans, , and Raje Ballagan-Evans, , were forced to move into temporary accommodation on August  due to severe leaks that left them without electricity.The leaks in their South London home were so serious that water was dripping through their fire alarm and coming through their ceiling, MyLondon reports. John, who is a leaseholder, has lived in the Aylesbury Estate for five years and has dealt with a number of leaks and property “neglect” since he moved in.  The couple has been forced to move between dferent Premier Inn hotels since they left two months ago. They say they are struggling to cope living and working in the budget hotel. Their room does not have any kitchen facilities and they are forced to spend their money on ready-made meals and takeaways. They also need to use other laundry facilities. The couple says they have spent £, on extra expenses since living in the hotel. John said: “We are struggling to cope in the hotel. Working [and] living in one room that we have had to move from regularly.” Southwark Council has said repairs are taking place, but John says the leaks are still no closer to being fixed. In a recent video taken by John, the leaks are still persisting. John also says that the hotel stay is often extended by the council at the last minute meaning they need to go to other Premier Inns that have availability.  He said: Everything is so last minute, we have no order. We are forced to live day by day. The couple is also facing bulls of thousands of pounds for repairs on their home, which they say they are not liable for. John added: “We have [a] service charge of which I pay over £ for the upkeep of the building. As the building has been neglected, they are adding charges to update: infrastructure, heating of the building, fire safety and many other things.” The Aylesbury Estate is currently undergoing a “regeneration” programme which will see the estate demolished block by block and replaced by more than , homes by .  Southwark Council says the hundreds of empty homes in the council blocks due for redevelopment are being used as temporary housing for homeless families, including on the Aylesbury Estate and the Ledbury. A Southwark Council councillor said the couple will be back in their home as soon as possible. Cllr Stephanie Cryan, Cabinet Member for Council Homes and Homelessness at Southwark council, also apologised to the couple for the inconvenience.  She previously said: “We are in contact with Mr Evans and his we while we are doing everything we can to resolve issues at their property. We appreciate how stressful this must be for them and I hope they’re able toto their home as soon as possible. In the meantime, I am very sorry for the inconvenience and thank them for their patience. “One of the many reasons we chose to rebuild on the estate is the poor condition of the current blocks, which can often lead to signicant repairs being needed. This highlights the need for redevelopment so that we can offer residents the high-quality new homes they deserve.” The Council added that the redevelopment of the Aylesbury Estate will increase the overall provision of social housing across the estate. Furthermore, the council say leaseholders from Wendover will have the option to move into the new homes on a shared equity basis. The Wendover block, which belongs to the next phase of redevelopment, will deliver more than , new homes, new parks, sports facilities and a nursery. The Mirror has contacted Southwark Council for an updated statement.

The four-day public holiday is planned so celebrations can take place across a four-day weekend in June , with an eye-popping budget of between £million and £ million. A huge “Platinum Pageant” is planned for the grand finale on the last day which will showcase the story of the Queenaposs reign and is set to take place through the streets of the capital. The likes of Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Ed Sheeran are being lined up to perform and are top of the list for organisers.Giant dragons the size of London buses and beasts as tall as three storey houses will create a spectacle and military and NHS heroes will come together next year to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.  More than , street performers are due to take part in the street parade on Sunday June  next year, Nicholas Coleridge, a co-chair of the pageant and chairman of the Victoria  Albert Museum, he said. It is set to run through Westminster, under Admiralty Arch, down the Mall, past Buckingham Palace and up past Constitution Hill, with people from across the country taking part. Dame Helen Mirren and legendary comic actor Stephen Fry are to join a Best of British cast. The four-day weekend will begin on the Thursday with Trooping the Colour, which will be staged in full for the first time since the pandemic, and a service of thanksgiving for the Queenaposs reign will be held at St Paulaposs Cathedral on the Saturday. Sundayaposs pageant will comprise of three acts, with the first seeing both serving troops and veterans take part in a march along The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace. The second act, entitled Celebration, will feature a puppet dragon larger than a double-decker bus with a wingspan the width of The Mall.  Others taking part will include a trapeze artist suspended underneath a huge balloon printed with an image of the Queen, as well as acrobats and other performers. The specially-written fairy story There Once Is A Queen by renowned author Sir Michael Morpurgo will be brought to le through artists on the day. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Mr Coleridge said the event will be larger than the celebrations during Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in .  He told the Mail: It’s going to be the largest that’s ever put on, larger we think even than that that was put on for Queen Victoria. “It’s not going to be London-centric. We even have a giant map, making sure that we have people from every part of our country and indeed every part of the Commonwealth. “We’re going to have people from all  Commonwealth countries who are going to be taking part in this astounding parade.  He added that there will be all the pomp and circumstance of a normal royal event with the royal family playing a key role along with the procession of coaches and famous faces. While Elton Johnaposs Farewell Yellow Brick Road world tour clashes with the event, organisers hope the Rocket Man will still be able to have an input. The star had similar issues in  for the Party at the Palace which marked the Queenaposs Golden Jubilee. On that occasion he pre-recorded a set and, while this could be an option once again, there is also the chance he may appear via a live stream. A source told the Sun: They have got Ed Sheeran and Stevie Wonder, who appeared at the Diamond Jubilee celebration, on the top of their list of performers and the organisers have already reached out. The BBC has predicted that the showcase pageant on the final day will be watched by around one billion people across the world.  A Gallop Through History has been billed as a personal tribute to our monarchy and will feature more than  horses and over a thousand dancers and musicians taking the audience on a journey from Elizabeth I to the Queen. The monarch has a le-long love of all things equestrian and is being kept informed by organisers of their plans, and her ponies and horses are expected to feature in the event, with royal fans hoping to see members of the royal family taking part. Mr Coleridge added: “I suspect they may be slightly exaggerating but it’s going to be huge because it’s going everywhere.  “By the end of it, I hope we’re going to feel re-energised, highly patriotic and very much one nation as we all celebrate the Platinum Jubilee.” An extended bank holiday, from Thursday nd to Sunday th June, will begin with Trooping the Colour, which will be staged in full for the first time since the pandemic, followed by a service of thanksgiving for the Queenaposs reign at St Paulaposs Cathedral on the Friday. On Saturday, the Queen will be accompanied by members of her family at The Derby at Epsom Downs with a special concert outside Buckingham Palace in the evening. One courtier with knowledge of the plans said: “It is going to absolutely be the best of British on show and there will be something for everyone to enjoy on what will be a series of magnicent occasions during one of the biggest celebratory events for decades.” Members of the public will be invited to apply to attend this special event and details of the ballot for UK residents to secure audience tickets will be released in due course. More than  million people tuned in to watch the concert which marked the Queen’s th year on the throne.Fans were treated to a musical masterclass from the likes of Sir Tom Jones and Sir Paul McCartney, which celebs such as Jimmy Carr and Lenny Henry took up hosting duties.

That’s why it’s hard for us to seek help, even when we know things aren’t right. We’re highly-driven people and don’t like to accept that we’re not as strong as our colleagues, and admitting you’re having mental health issues is like admitting a weakness or failure. Being a doctor is not just a job, it’s an identity, so there’s a real fear of what it meansyou think you can’t do your job. It’s like opening the floodgates. As an intensive care consultant I was really at the sharp end of the Covid deaths. I went into hero mode during the peak, working all hours leading our hospital’s response to the pandemic on top of the distressing work in charge of the ICU.Have you struggled with your mental health in lockdown  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story We’re a small general hospital and would normally have around three intensive care patients. During Covid that went up to , and we have to physically move the ICU into the operating theatres and recovery rooms. Families are normally a big part of intensive care, but they weren’t allowed to visit, only when the patient was dying. That was awful and we felt like we had to replace that role and be their families too, while at the same time speaking to these really distressed families on the phone who couldn’t be there and couldn’t understand what was going on.  We were dealing with a disease we’d never seen before which did some horrible things to people. The treatment, too, caused a lot of distress. We had to turn people onto their front, and they had no families there, it’s almost like it dehumanises people. The phone calls were the hardest part. I was the one who had to make the decision that enough’s enough, and that’s a very dficult phone call to make to families. Often the patient died before you could do any of that.  We did the best we could for every patient that came through the door, but we were not working with the right staffing, we were in an environment that wasn’t designed for what we were doing, and there were shortages of PPE and equipment. We only got ventilators in May, instead having to use theatre ventilators which aren’t designed for continuous usage. The pressure took its toll and, once the peak was over, I started to feel very negative about getting back to normal. I was very short tempered, at home and with managers at work, and I increasingly isolated myself from people I love at home and friends at work - the people who normally kept me sane in a very stressful job that I’d done for years.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust.

I was getting on with my job and no-one would have known. It was a manager at work who first opened the conversation, a very friendly and supportive chat when he suggested I needed to take some time off.  I knew things weren’t right but I didn’t want to go off sick, because I knew all my colleagues were overloaded and I didn’t want to overload them more. But that prompted me to seek help, and although it was a big decision, but it was also a big relief, like a lightbulb moment. I sought help from the NHS practitioner help programme, who signed me off sick immediately. A GP put me on antidepressants. I didn’t argue - I’d reached rock bottom and I was just desperate to feel better. I just wanted someone to take over my care and tell me what to do.  I was off for three months, but it took three more months to get back to my work pattern, and it’s taken a year for me to start to feel like my normal self. As I got better I started to do my own rehab plan. I took up wild swimming, spent a lot of time in nature and with animals, started an art course. In the beginning it was just rest, I gave myself permission to not do much at all. I don’t feel like a failure, I feel like a survivor. You have Covid patients who nearly died but got through it, and I have my own pandemic survival story too. The key lesson I learned was that I needed to put on my own oxygen mask first, I need to look after myself in order to properly care for others. The experience has helped me see the warning signs in others, and I’m seeing a lot of doctors who are struggling. Often they are subtle changes, they don’t seem themselves, they turn up to work and don’t talk to anyone, they have a shorter temper. It took a while to build my confidence up but I now talk openly about my mental health issues, and that often prompts others to think about whether they are alright or not too.  I know of three suicides of doctors in the last six months, all anaesthetists in intensive care wards. Unlike other hospital staff, doctors don’t have line managers who might notice problems. We hide it from our colleagues, patients and families and let it get really bad, but don’t seek help. Just like everyone , we need to get over the stigma of mental health, the fear that your career might be affectedyou ask for help, and know that it’s OK to not be OK.How to get help: If you are struggling or you are worried about a loved one, contact Samaritans on .

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work! Hannah’s story is a great example of how le can get better when you try something new, soyou already love Popcorn chicken - tasty pops of  per cent chicken breast, perfect to nibble on by themselves or as a side - then itaposs time to turn up the heat.

It is understood the potential documentary would be about early childhood development with a royal source claiming the secret meeting was for preliminary and for research purposes. Kateaposs documentary could have the feel of the BBCaposs popular geneaology series Who Do You Think You Are , in which famous figures explore their ancestry and family history. A source told the Mail Online : Catherine is very interested in a programme. She thinks it could be a really signicant way to explore an important subject. Sheaposs been very impressed with Williamaposs efforts and knows how much he enjoyed making his Earthshot series. The -year-old duchess said earlier this week that she had been exploring four generations of her family as part of her work into early childhood development. A Kensington Palace spokesman told the Mail Online the reported meeting with Mr Glover was private and declined to comment further. It comes after criticism of Prince Harry and his actress we Meghan Markle, who recently signed a deal worth a reported £ million to make films and programmes for streaming giant Netflix.However, the fierce critics of the young coupleaposs private business affairs have so far appeared less bothered about similar moves being made by Kate and her husband, Prince William. The Duke of Cambridge worked on an environmental series with Sir David Attenborough, which began on the BBC this week, to little or none of the same vitriol levied at Prince Harry and Meghan for striking a deal with Netflix.

SoI am brutally honest, being told to stay indoors during lockdown and the pandemic, suited me more than most. As long as I could see and speak to my friends and family via the internet I was not too perturbed. The thing is, I didn’t really miss the human or social contact too much, I got used to doing my own thing, on my own and in my space. I’m someone who grew up without a lot of hugs and fuss, so when people were getting down about missing the human contact, I have to say, I didn’t. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  I also like not making an effortI don’t have to, again, lockdown gave me the perfect excuse to indulge in my habits, no makeup, no hair, lounging around in my baggy clothes and flats, I loved it. So as the restrictions have eased and people are slowly going back to le as we know it, I’ve had a bit of social anxiety, but it was three huge events this week that made me think , without putting in the effort , you just don’t get the rewards and I realised through three separate situations that I am not destined to be a recluse, in fact I need that human contact and touch to make me a better person and bring out the best in me. My first big social gathering where I had to make an effort was at a friends wedding. I think the last nuptials I attended was about  years ago. But attending a wedding after lockdown is a whole dferent experience. This couple, like so many had had to postpone their special day so many times and to finally have a date and be able to invite the guests that they had planned for was a truly joyous occasion.  For me, my hubby and  kids, this was the first time in  years that we were formally dressed and went out to a big gathering. The emotions got to me – seeing my daughter and son look so smart made me realise how grown up they had become. The wedding was one big tear jerking happy and joyous occasion – witnessing a beautul bride and a handsome groom finally getting to tie the knot in front of their loved ones, brought out sentiments in me that I had forgotten I even possessed. I was reminded of the importance of being with other humans to come together and celebrate a happy occasion, the need for these occasions to be a vital place for people to re connect, catch up and rekindle friendships and family bonds. I left that wedding feeling that a part of me had been lit up again and I felt more human, knowing the purpose and importance of having other people in my le.  The second event that reminded me about making an effort and to socialise again and get myself out of the lockdown habit of “oh I can’t be bothered” was attending my daughter’s afternoon autumn school festival. She’d been practising her songs all week and said,”mummy will you be able to come to my concert ” I needed time off work like I needed a hole in the head and so said, “I’m really sorry, daddy’s going, but mummy has lots of work to do.” I could see the disappointment in her face, but I knew that as long as one of us were there, she’d be alright. But when the day came, my hubby said,” this is the first play the kids have put on in the school since the pandemic, it’s her last year at primary school, I think your’ll regret ityou don’t go.” He was right, I felt so guilty, so I put my work to one side and headed to my daughters daytime concert. Get all the latest news straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Again, I am so glad to have made the effort, sitting there in the school hall alongside all the other parents who had been through the same home schooling challenges that Steve and I had. I had forgotten the importance of belonging to a parental community, and whilst we had our masks on we could not smile with our mouths, but we did with our eyes and arms. Watching my daughter stand there singing alongside all her friends about the beauty of the world we live in and the importance of being grateful choked me with tears. This was a beautul way for parents, teachers and the children to all come together to celebrate through music and song the union of school and education. I will never miss a school event ever again, because making the effort to attend rewarded me with an experience of pure joy and a reminder of my parental duties – to be there for my daughters, teachers and the school. The final event was to attending an awards ceremony to celebrate inspirational people. It was a red carpet event which meant I had to get very glam to go into London. The logistics and timings meant that I had to get up at .am - could I be bothered  I decided that as I had said Yes I could attend, I therefore could not let people down. So off I went on the train into the big smoke, got to the hairdressers, put my makeup and glad rags on and got a taxi to the event. As soon as I got there I was so glad that I had made the effort – it was so wonderful to see London again and so many famous and non famous faces dressed up, drinking, enjoying the conversations and coming together to support people who have strived to help others in the pandemic. My highlight was meeting for the first time face to face Emily, a young lady I have been working with since January – we have spoken on the phone every week despite never having physically met, so when we did finally see each other’s faces, we hugged and hugged like long lost friends. Again, making the effort for people I work with rewarded me with a wonderful feeling of belonging, of feeling that I am valued for my work and feeling part of a team. These experiences really woke me up to the fact that I am not me unless I am with other people, I need their social contact, the human touch of a hug, kiss on the cheek, a smile, laughter and to stand next to people and feel their presence. All these events in their own special way made me realise that unless you make the effort out of lockdown you will not experience the rewards of living le alongside other people.Comment MORE ON Sunday MirrorBritney SpearsSaira KhanEducationMarriageSchoolsUnionsCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was actually on my lunch break at work, so I shared the news straight away with all my colleagues!” Sarah is one of  million people who have received that exciting news telling them theyaposre a winner, since The Health Lottery launched  years ago, giving away £ million in prizes in that time. And the timing was perfect for the mother and grandmother from Oldham. Sarah turns  soon, and the £, windfall means she can really celebrate her half-century milestone in style. With partner Darren also reaching that golden birthday this year, Sarah plans to invest her winnings in a top-notch sunny holiday.The Health Lottery turns  this month. In that time,  million players have netted £ million worth of prizes - and theyaposre not the only winners.

My partner and I both turn the big - this year, and we’re treating ourselves with a holiday of a letime to Mexico. We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

Few would have appreciated the anguish and suffering she had endured growing up and how she nearly died from anorexia as a teenager. Now the bridal design company owner is helping others fight potentially deadly eating disorders. At age , April spent a week in hospital after her weight plunged to three-and-a-half stone. She traces her weight problems to when she was eight. Her parents orced and she felt rejected. April would throw her lunch into the bushes on the way to school and only nibble on crackers. At meal times she would sit staring at her plate for hours, until dad Ian, an Olympic cyclist who won a  bronze in Montreal, would lose his patience and send her to bed. She finally overcame her issues when she was . She won Ms Great Britain , a contest for women aged  and over. April, , who is ft in, now weighs a healthy eight-and-a-half stone and visits schools as an ambassador for eating disorder charity SEEDto talk to young people about their problems and mental health issues. “At my lowest point I weighed three-and-a-half stone,” said April, who was raised by Ian and her nan Dorothy. “There’s a picture of me on a bicycle and I look so gaunt, I was in the worst place possible. Dad took that picture to show how bad it was. “It was very distressing for Dad and Nan. I ended up in hospital for over a week, I ­nearly died. That was the wake-up call I needed.” Dorothy inspired her recovery but it still took April several years to start eating properly. She said: “Nan sat me down and made me watch a film about a young girl with ­anorexia who died. “Nan said she didn’t want that to be me. After hospital I still found it % dficult to eat, it took me years to eat.  “I was about , it was a long slow process. Anorexia is a mental disorder, a mind over matter thing. You have to train the mind to no longer play tricks and that food is no longer the enemy. “I’ve had counselling. I had so much therapy well into early adult le, Dad made sure I spoke to the therapist and had regular weight check-ins. “Even on the road to recovery my body mass index was at a point of looking anorexic. I was eating and eating and not gaining weight, I was trying to recover. My family knew I was but I had a ­naturally fast metabolism. “My family made my meals, everything was monitored. My absolute favourite now is a Sunday dinner, I love it, beef or chicken.”  A record number of children and young people with a potentially le-threatening eating disorder are waiting for treatment in England. In April to June,  patients were on stand by for urgent treatment, up from  at the same time last year. A further , patients were waiting for routine treatment, up from  a year earlier. April, who appeared on Channel ’s The Bachelor and ITV’s The Cabins, has found it is not just children who are fixated with how they look. She said: “In my day job as a bridal designer, I see so many beautul women who are always ­talking about losing weight and looking perfect and it absolutely breaks my heart.” She posted videos online during lockdown to reach out to those who are struggling. April has had many positive messages since and, after lockdown, was approached by a woman in public, who told her: “You don’t realise the good you’ve done.”The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

For me to be able to help others who may not have recovered was the icing on the cake.” SEED chief exec Shelley Perry said of April: “SEED Lancashire and Breathe have thoroughly enjoyed working with someone that has such a passion for helping and supporting anyone suffering with mental health and eating disorders. “She’s a fantastic public figure that highlights the journey through recovery and helps to guide anyone needing support into the right place.

Colette Cheape has urged parents to be on the look out after watching her brave son Odhrán go through  weeks of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries in just under four years. He was just a few months old when aposmilky brown birth marksapos started appearing across his body in late . After being taken to get them checked out, he was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type  . This is a genetic condition that, in serious cases, causes a range of conditions including tumours, body deformities, blindness and learning dficulties. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Worried parents, Colette,  and Richard, , were told his case was at that stage still mild, meaning his condition was stable for the time being but had to be closely monitored. But in April , Odhrán started struggling with bowel movements and extreme tiredness It prompted an MRI scan at Glasgowaposs Royal Hospital for Children. Doctors then told Richard and Colette, from Kilsyth, the aposworst news imaginableapos. Odhrán had a brain tumour as a result of NF and to stand any chance of survival he urgently needed risky surgery to drain fluid the next day.Colette, whoaposs also mum to Aoe, , and one-year-old Una, told the Daily Record : When we were told the NF had resulted in a brain tumour our world fell apart.We were in lockdown where only Richard could stay in hospital with Odhrán, I felt so helpless. Doctors said he was, at that point, critically ill. It was so tough. For the next year and a half the family watched little Odhran fight off the condition. His second surgery to aposdebulkapos the large tumour on the brain, one week after the drainage op, was incredibly daunting in itself. Colette added: There was a chance heaposd not survive, come out blind or brain damaged, it was terrying. But we had no other option.  The procedure successfully removed % of the tumour and after a month-long recovery, where the toddler learned to walk again, Odhrán was reunited with his sisters at home. But in late May  medics discovered his tumour aposwasnapost behavingapos and put him on a -week course of chemotherapy, to eliminate the risk of it ever posing a danger again. On September  this year, one day before his fourth birthday, Odhrán finished chemotherapy for good. The family hosted a garden party to mark the special occasion where, surrounded by family and friends, the beaming youngster rang the bell to official mark the end of his treatment. To say thank you to hospital staff, gran Marie Brady launched an GoFundMe page, which has so far raised over £,. Colette also created a public Instagram account to document Odhránaposs recovery journey and raise awareness about aposcoffee spotsapos, formally known as Cafe Au Lait marks, and the condition NF. According to the Childhood Tumour Trust Neurofibromatosis Type is more prevalent than Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and Huntingtons Disease combined. Almost all NF patientswill have six or more Cafe Au Lait marks on their skin. She said: We are so grateful to the childrenaposs hospital, we donapost know where weaposd be without them. Odhrán loving weekly hospital chemo visits is testament to them. With the Instragram, I wanted to get the word out there. NF is more common that Cystic Fibrosis yet not that many people know about it. “We hope we can help to raise awareness of the signs of NF in order to help children receive early diagnosis and therefore the necessary specialist care.”For more information on Neurofibromatosis visit the NHS website or the Childhood Tumour TrustYou can donate to the familyaposs Childrenaposs Hospital fundraiser through their official JustGiving page.Comment MORE ON NHSChildrens HospitalHospitalsBrain Tumours\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ten of the creatures – including five mums – were found on plantations but away from the main forests. Dr Felicity Oram – whose efforts have been hailed by actress Dame Judi Dench – is working with growers and farmers in an innovative project to protect them. The conservationist said: “When you consider only about  orangutans remain in this area and the numbers are still declining, the discovery of these reproducing females is amazing and gives real hope for the future.  One key reason this is so fantastic is, while we haven’t yet done genetics as this is such a new discovery, it is likely these females represent additional genetic ersity important to the long-term health of the wild orangutan population overall.” Of her new partners, she added: “This is an opportunity not to be missed. Man must not be the steward of everything.” Palm oil is used in an array of household goods from biscuits to make-up. Its production is blamed for deforestation and threatening other species, including elephant and rhino. Dr Oram is working with a business consortium called Pongo Alliance and groups committed to conservation. She added: “Our work is only possible by collaboration with plantation staff many might think of as the so-called enemy. Some have been truly visionary.  “One estate manager told me: ‘My -year old daughter is a militant conservationist and she inspires me to do everything I can for the environment’. Her generation will inherit.” Dr Oram’s work is run in conjunction with the Stability Of Altered Forest Ecosystems Project – a long-term study decoding how the rainforest works and its effect on climate change. Project director Dr Glen Reynolds said: “Patches of forest within plantations form stepping stones and corridors along which animals can move and, over time, plants disperse. Our findings show there is fresh hope, not only for survival of the rainforest, but also the bioersity it supports from microbes in soil to the iconic orangutan and trees themselves.” One company pledging to help is Sime Darby Plantation, Malaysia’s largest producer of sustainable palm oil, which has already seen orangutans ing after major reforestation. The firm has a base in Liverpool.  Head of conservation and bioersity, Siti Norralakmam Yahya, said: “We are looking to lead the way at which areas need to be rehabilitated and are introducing plants which are endangered, rare and threatened which will become the gene pool for the next generation.” Dame Judi, , met Dr Oram – and apes at an orangutan orphanage – on a trip to Borneo in  for a documentary highlighting threats to rainforests. Dr Oram added: “Wild orangutans are the super mums of the world. We must do everything to protect these truly wild animals. They are irreplaceable.” Comment MORE ON Judi DenchClimate changeAnimalsSunday MirrorPalm OilRare animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Guthy has supported Democrat causes too, but backing Crumpacker seems hugely at odds with the royals’ views. The tycoon is also a gas-guzzling driver who let eco-warriors Harry and Meghan fly on his company’s private jet.  That trip, last month, came after a string of public engagements in New York by the couple, who say they are on a mission to “build a better world”.Since stepping down as senior royals they have launched the charity foundation Archewell – while also netting lucrative deals with the likes of Netflix and Spoty.A source told the Sunday Mirror: “Harry and Meghan have become regular visitors to Bill Guthy’s estate in Carpinteria. Bill is one of le’s winners. “He certainly knows all about how to make a buck. Guthy has made donations to Democrat campaigns for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but his backing of The Trumpbacker seems to point to a vastly dferent view to that of Harry and Meghan. “It appears the main thing the three of them have in common is a talent for making big money deals.”  Guthy lives on a vast estate in Carpinteria, north of Los Angeles and  miles from the home of Harry, , Meghan, , and their children Archie, two, and baby Lilibet. He also has a £million pad in Beverly Hills, with tennis court and pool. Aged , he drives a mpg Cadillac Escalade ESV. That, plus his support of Crumpacker, may spark interesting chats with the royals. Records show that he donated , in  to the Oregon Republican’s failed bid to be elected to Congress. Crumpacker vowed to protect gun rights and the unborn and to “stand with Trump, get the economy moving and build the wall”.

Guthy’s earlier Republican donations included , to the  Bush Cheney campaign. Meghan spoke out against Trump in a TV interview in . She said: “Trump is isive, think about female voters alone. In  the Republican Party lost the female vote by  points and with as mis-ogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that’s a huge chunk of it.” Harry, meanwhile, told a prank caller who impersonated Greta Thunberg: “The mere fact Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry so big, he has blood on his hands. The effect that has on the climate. Trump will want to meet you to make him look better, but he won’t want a discussion about climate change because you will outsmart him.” Guthy and business partner Greg Renker launch-ed their firm in  after being inspired by Think and Grow Rich, written by Napoleon Hill in . The pals used savings to promote the guide via TV infomercials. Sales of the book, and a tape of Hill’s lectures, netted nearly million.  One of the best-selling self-help books of all time, it urges readers to believe anything is possible, telling wannabe millionaires to write down their aims on a piece of paper and read them back to themselves morning and night.

Kingaposs Oak Academ in Bristol wonapost let its secondary-age children go to the toilet outside break times unless they have been given a pass for medical needs.Jessica Bowden, whose -year-old daughter Eboney is in Year , claims the timings of the school day mean finding a time to go can be dficult, Bristol Live reported. The breaks are not very long, about  minutes at am, and I think lunchtime is only  to  minutes, she said. By the time theyaposve eaten, a lot of them are not getting time to go to the toilet.  Theyaposre going home with full water bottles because theyaposre not drinking. Mine comes home dying of thirst and saying, aposOh, I can have a drink now.apos Ms Bowden, , says she has seen  or  parents of children across Years  and  complaining about the rule this week on social media. Ms Bowden claims Eboney and other pupils without toilet passes have been refused a note when they have needed to use the facilities. She said: When I called reception to complain, the school office lady told me it was because some children have caused damage by vandalising the toilets, and some older years have been in there vaping and setting off the fire alarm. I understand thataposs a problem, but they need to address that separately, not punish the rest of the school.  My daughter is not the type of child who says she needs to use the toilet to avoid lessons. Do the teachers need a pass to go to the toilet  I canapost get my head round it.One parent told me she was glad sheaposd seen a Facebook post about it, because sheaposd been wondering why her son wasnapost drinking anything.When she spoke to him he said, aposI didnapost want to drink mum, because they wonapost let me go to the toilet.apos Another mum said her daughters, who are in Years  and , have had requests to use the toilet refused by teachers, which has caused them stress. She said: This issue has been going on since theyaposve come back in September. It was on September  that I asked the school for toilet passes for my children.  My daughter in Year  finally got one last week but it will only run until the end of term, which is just two weeks away. my child in Year  had been coming home really ill, with really bad headaches and heatstroke.I realised she wasnapost drinking during the day because of this policy. My Year  daughter still doesnapost have a pass. She text me today stressed, saying, aposThey wonapost give me a toilet pass unless I have a medical note.apos They were told yesterday in assembly that theyaposre old enough now to control their bladders. The mum suggested the time between the start of school and break was too long to go without a toilet break. Especially for girls of an age where they are starting their periods, this should not be allowed, she continued. I think itaposs just awful that it takes two and half hoursbefore theyaposre allowed to go to the bathroom. They will not have a drink when they wake up because of this. Iaposm worried it could cause kidney infections.  The school says toilets are available for students to use throughout the day, but pupils are encouraged to go before school and at breaktime and lunchtime. These are the times when all toilet areas are open. Principal Katherine Ogden said: During lesson times, on the upper school site, three toilet locationsare open. Students with medical needs have toilet passes to allow them to go at any point. She added: Other students, who find that they need to go to the toilet during lesson time, are permitted to go with a note from their teacher.” On Friday, after they were approached by the media, the school sent a letter to parents which said: Other students, who find that they need to go to the toilet during lesson time, are permitted to go,absolutely necessary, with a note from their teacher.” Ms Ogden says a letter was sent to parents and carers on Friday, reminding them of the academyaposs policies and procedures regarding leaving classrooms during lessons.

They claim the council doesnapost care about their plight and hasnapost helped them. Jacquie Gilmartin, a -year-old cancer survivor, says she cannot go into her kitchen after pm due to the constant scurrying and the rats in the walls.Speaking to My London, Jacquie said: I reported the issue back in May but I have reason to believe the council knew about it long before then. The rats and mice are all in the cavities and they’re in the walls. I can’t go into my kitchen past  pm because of it and I can’t go in there in the morning until someone has checked. The same with the bathroom, there’s just constant scurrying. It’s no way to live. Rats and mice have been found all over the estate in a number of properties and in communal recreational spaces as well.  Rodents can be seen decomposing in the grass in several graphic photographs. Jacquie, who has lived on the estate all her le, added: “The council is saying that the estate is substandard but I’ve seen no proof. There’s a vermin problem but that doesn’t mean the estate needs to be demolished. “They want to knock down eight homes to replace it with eleven apparently, which isn’t exactly a massive addition to housing. Residents were asked via email to fill out a housing needs form but many have refused citing that no planning permission has been granted. George Dagan, who has called the estate home for  years, says the vermin problem has worsened his mental health challenges.  He said: “I’m an extremely vulnerable person who has very complex mental health issues. “I have been struggling for the past year with the threat of losing my house to demolition and then having to share my home with mice and rats since last May. “My whole support network is on this estate and Southwark council are ripping my le apart. “The effect on my mental health has got to the point where I don’t want to be here anymore. “The council doesn’t care about us, they just care about developers and profit.” And Amanda Davies, who has been on the estate for over  years, said: “I’ve lived with mice and rats in my flat for six months now, two of which Southwark refused to acknowledge my reports. I’ve had a sharp downturn in my mental health leading to me having to report suicidal thoughts to my GP and my asthma has been affected. “I have had financial dficulty as I have had to replace food and clothing that has been destroyed or contaminated by vermin.” MyLondon has reached out to Southwark council for a response.

Often the names are inspired by favourite singers, places, people or in one womanaposs case her childhood doll. The woman explained that when she and her sister were kids, they used to play house all the time, and would choose names for their doll, acting asit were their daughter. Although they would change the name often, Harlow was their favourite. Fast forward a few years, and one of the sisters, now , has given birth to a baby girl whom she decided to give that name. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.I really like this name and when I suggested it to my partner, he did as well, she wrote in her Reddit post.We chose it for our daughter and decided not to tell anyone the name until birth . But when she announced the name to her sister Mary, , she reacted very poorly, shouting and calling me an a**hole. Mary screamed at me, that I stole the name we picked out together and didnapost even tell her, that I had no right to take her name. She said that Iaposm tainting the memories of our childhood and erasing her. She has not spoken to me since and hasnapost even seen her niece. I think I might have been too mean for screaming back at her and not trying to understand her side of the story, but we havenapost mentioned this name in years and I didnapost think that it would be such a big problem.  She concluded her post by asking whether she was in the wrong for not trying to understand how her sister felt, but users were in agreement that her sister was childish and that refusing to meet her niece is ridiculous. One person said: You had a kid first and it was a name you both gave your dolls growing up. Your sister is being childish. Another wrote: I just don’t get people claiming names. She’s mad you named your kid Harlow, but I’m guessing she wanted to do the same thing, right  Telling her beforehand wouldn’t have changed anything. She’d just have been mad about it longer. And, not seeing her niece because of it is ridiculous. But a third admitted: You’re right but sometimes name taking is annoying. My cousin named his firstborn after me, didn’t think anything of it. He named his second kid after my sister, and we thought ok weird but whatever. The third kid he named after my kid and I was pissed. The icing on the cake is he named their dog after my deceased one.

Aiyana, who asked that her second name be withheld, recorded the surreal footage from the roof of her home in Chicago, Illinois. The video shows a long black wishbone shape hanging in the air, with both its wings ending in some sort of sphere. She said: “I literally have no idea what it was. There is nothing comparable. “It was a ball of some sort with two long strings or belts hanging from it. The strings had knobs in the middle and bottom.” Aiyana and her son said neither of them “had any idea what we were seeing”. She said she stayed watching it until it disappeared from view. “It seemed to just float slowly south east without any other major movement,” she said. “It covered a few miles in about  minutes.” “I felt total confusion and a bit creeped out,” she added.Hoping to find answers, a friend shared Aiyana’s footage with UFO watchers online but no one was able to explain how an object could float so calmly above the famously “windy city”.One person wrote: “Iaposve never seen a balloon just hang still in the open air like that. It should bob, evenjust a little. There must be absolutely zero wind there.” Another person described the sighting as “bizarre”, adding: “I have no explanation. It looks like something hanging from a helicopter, except there is no helicopter. “The shape is too weird for it being a balloon, and I think I can also exclude it being an antenna on top of a building in cloud cover – for this, it is way too clearly defined. “I have no idea!”  A third said: “A balloon usually has some movement. I live in Chicago. Even on a still, calm day, Chicago and the surrounding areas have wind of some sort and would move something in the air.” The unexplained sighting is just one of several in the US in recent weeks. Another video, captured in Baltimore, Maryland, attracted a deluge of comments revealing identical sightings in numerous states. In September, a man spotted what appeared to be glowing orange UFOs “flying in formation” when ing home. When he posted the footage online, social media users recalled similar sightings in Washington DC, Las Vegas, St Louis and Detroit. Meanwhile in the UK, a woman was left baffled after capturing an image of a possible UFO hovering in the evening sky over St Helens, Merseyside while taking a friend on a late-night drive.She later toldthe Liverpool Echo :I couldnapost see any lights around it or anything, you can just see the blue thing in the sky. I was just taking a picture of the Moon while we were out because I thought it looked nice.”She added: “We were just like oh, my god, it does look like a UFO. It does look like a ship, it doesnapost look like a plane or a light, it looks like a UFO. I sort of believe in them. Iaposm not a strong believer but I do believe there are aliens out there and stuff like that. It’s interesting. You can see it but it was strange. I believe more now I can see it.

In April , six mineworkers were admitted to hospital with coronavirus-like systems after working in a bat-infested cave. Three eventually died. According to Dr Latham, the virus that eventually became SARS-CoV- and caused Covid- may have evolved inside the bodies of these miners before escaping into the population, through samples of the disease that were sent to researchers in Wuhan. The emergence of the Alpha iant in Kent last year from a single immunocompromised patient, he suggests, is evidence that the virus can make “strange evolutionary leaps” when inside an inidual for a long time.  Speaking at a British Medical Journalwebinar, Dr Latham said: The theory requires many hundreds of mutations in one miner to turn into Sars-Cov-. Decades were crammed into about six months. But we have heard of the surprising phenomenon of isolated cases of greatly accelerated evolution in viruses in Britain. As much evolution occurred in that one inidual in England as had occurred in the millions of other infections. Our theory proposes that a similar evolution was happening inside the lungs of miners following the mystery disease in  and argues that the virus leaked from a medical sample obtained from the miners infected by the outbreak. About , kilometres from Wuhan, the Mojiang mines are home to several of the lab origin theories surrounding Covid-. Back in , the workers fell sick after scrubbing a copper seam clean of bat faeces and were admitted to a hospital in the provincial capital of Kunming with persistent coughs, fevers, head and chest pains and breathing dficulties. Medical records at the time concluded the six workers, aged between  and , were victims of a SARS-like coronavirus contracted from horseshoe bats, Reuters reports. When scientists ed to the mine at the end of , they found samples of a pathogen that came to be known as the Mojiang virus”. The Mojiang virus is found in rats and unrelated to SARS-CoV-, and it was not confirmed whether it was behind the miners’ illness. Since then, China’s top bat coronavirus researcher, the Wuhan Institute of VirologyapossShi Zhengli, has said that the workersapos pneumonia-like symptoms were caused by a fungal infection and that there was no sign they had been infected with SARS-CoV-.  But the case of the mineworkers has been used by those supporting the idea that a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV- could have been infecting humans as early as . First identied in , a virus named RaTG was discovered from the anus of a horseshoe bat in the same caves. According to a paper by Shi and other researchers, RaTG shares .% of its genome with SARS-CoV- but must have erged  years earlier. The new theory by Dr Latham suggests that the evolution from a virus such as RaTG could have occurred far more quickly inside the body of a miner. Dr Latham said: “We know that coronaviruses were erse and abundant near the mine, and we know that some of the miners underwent y hospitalisations. “Their treatment lasted six months and allowed the evolution of novel adapted human coronaviruses.  “We know many medical samples were sent to the Wuhan institute of Virology, so the question is,what was in the samples, and what was done with any viruses that were found ”China and WIV have strenuously denied allegations that coronavirus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory but Alison Young, the Hurley Chair in Public Affairs Reporting at the Missouri School of Journalism, said lab leaks of dangerous viruses were common throughout the world, thereports. She said: “Lab accidents are not rare. In the US in  there were  reported lab exposure incidences of viruses, bacteria and toxins that the US government regulates. “Lab accidents and exposures happen frequently.” Comment MORE ON British Medical JournalUS Bioscience Inc.SarsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the coming weeks, tens of millions across the world will do just that, stirred by the haunting wartime poem In Flanders Fields. But they are only able to buy a poppy at all thanks to the remarkable drive of a woman whose role was long forgotten about – but is now being celebrated as part of the Royal British Legion’s centenary celebrations. It was in  that Lt Colonel John McCrae – a Canadian wartime surgeon – famously wrote “we shall not sleep, though poppies grow, in Flanders fields”. He was referring to blood-red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers – including a friend – in Ypres. But it was five years later that the seeds of the poppy’s global appeal were being sown, thanks to French academic Anna Guérin.  Though little known, she is now credited as the single most important person in the story of the Remembrance Day poppy. Her efforts played a huge role in making the Poppy Appeal the ­irrepressible force that it is today. Across the UK, , collectors will be on the streets ahead of Remembrance Day on November , selling poppies and raising funds for the Legion’s good causes. Down the years they included the likes of Walter Randall, , from Leighton Buzzard, Beds. The UK’s oldest poppy seller, he died last year.  Wally was just a child when Madame Guérin began promoting the poppy. She travelled the world and mobilised an army of women and children to sell the flowers, raising valuable funds to support families bereaved after the First World War. Author and historian Julie Summers, who has written We Are The Legion: The Royal British Legion at , says: “Her role in the story of the poppy is not well-known. “She was barely mentioned in the British press at the time and in subsequent history books she gets a line or two at most. “Moina Michael claimed responsibility for the worldwide adoption of the poppy, effectively writing Madame Guérin out of the story. “British newspapers ran promotional articles about the plans for Poppy Day, using lines from In Flanders Fields, but made no mention of Madame Guérin.”  Inspired by McCrae, US academic and writer Moina is often cited as the person who made the poppy globally signicant, having convinced the American Legion Auxiliary to adopt it in . But at the same time Madame Guérin was promoting the poppy and, by the end of , was responsible for the adoption of Poppy Days in several US states. While Moina remained focused on America, in  Madame Guérin made an impassioned address to the Catholic Women’s League of Canada in Toronto.  And later that year she arrived in Liverpool and set out for London, convinced she could persuade the fledgling British Legion to accept her idea. She also knew she could help it to organise the appeal nationwide. Her experience of working with war widows had convinced her of the value of using women volunteers for a network of distribution and collection. Madame Guérin then offered to fund the manufacture of a million poppies in France, which the British Legion accepted, and even went on to supply poppies to New Zealand. But author Julie says a combination of misogyny and racism have demoted her to just a footnote in the poppy’s history. “Nobody questions where the origins of the poppy came from,” Julie says. “It’s fair to assume there was a bit of misogyny in it – being French and a woman was a deadly combination. “While women in the UK were eventually given the vote in , a lot of women weren’t popular at the time because they’d taken men’s jobs during the war and men were trying to reassert their authority. “So Madame Guérin disappeared from history, which is such a pity. But she was actually representing widows and orphans. There were so many in the UK at the time. And that really will have struck a chord with people. Remembrance is not just about remembering the dead – it’s about the impact on society generally and honouring those left behind after war.  “And it was the widows and the orphans who really led the sales of the poppies because they had the energy and enthusiasm for remembrance.” Madame Guérin was born in Valon in  and followed her first husband to French colony Madagascar, where she ran a school for girls. She excelled, building her career as a passionate teacher and communicator. Twice-married, she came to Britain in  with her two daughters and enrolled them at a London boarding school. She lectured in French, speaking about her experiences in Madagascar and prominent women from France’s history – even dressing up as icons such as Joan of Arc.  When hostilities broke out in  she travelled to the US to raise funds for those made destitute by the war – and sending proceeds of her lectures to the relief organisation Secours de France in Paris. After the Armistice in November , she ed briefly to France before going back to America to promote the idea of the poppy being adopted as the symbol of remembrance. Julie says: “She was not the first person to the party, but she was most certainly the energy behind what became the concept of Poppy Day in Britain and the Commonwealth.” In the early days, women clutching boxes of flowers and Haig Fund tins were commonplace as the poppy appeal took hold. The fund – initially named after First World War Field Marshal Douglas Haig – officially became the Poppy Appeal in . Julie says the power of Madame Guérin’s work has ensured the poppy’s lasting legacy.  She says: “It’s unying, an amazingly democratic flower. For example, roses are quite exclusive, they’re quite snobby. Whereas poppies grow wild and are not cultivated – they have no status. They just spring up. “It has always been an incredibly strong symbol of le that goes on surrounded by death. And red is a very powerful colour: it means danger, it means blood, but it also means love. And they’re a sign of positivity and future and I think that is the enduring appeal of the poppy. “What has impressed me more than anything is the passion and determination of the early founders to make the Legion work for every man, woman and child who needed its support in those post-First World War years. That passion and commitment is still alive today in the people I have spoken to and I find that humbling and heartening.” Remembrance Day looked very dferent last year due to lockdown. So the Legion is excited to be able to resume the Poppy Appeal with collectors back on the streets.  Last year, Captain Sir Tom Moore – whose charity walks raised nearly £million – captured the spirit of a nation determined to help the less fortunate. This year is poignant, too, says Julie. The Legion’s centenary came as the UK prepared to withdraw from Afghanistan – a -year mission which cost the lives of  UK personnel. She adds: “Remembrance is not just about world war, it’s also about all conflict that followed. “The pandemic has a lot of parallels to the world wars, so the importance of remembrance couldn’t be more timely or more at the forefront of the public consciousness. And stories like Captain Tom’s show how much the older generation reaches out to the younger generation. “And that has really helped the longevity of the Legion too and chimes with a lot of people. I predict the Poppy Appeal will be more successful than ever this year.” Comment MORE ON World War IWorld War Remembrance DayJoan of ArcJohn McCraeCommonwealthRoyal British LegionPoppiesSoldiersAdoption\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

All other Canary Islands airports remain open. Since the Cumbre Vieja volcano began erupting on Sept.  it has destroyed nearly , buildings and engulfed , acres of land, the European Commission Copernicus Emergency Management Service tweeted. The Mirror told of the plight of  residents who were forced to flee their homes three weeks ago.Officials on the Spanish Canary Island of la Palma began evacuating  people and animals before huge plumes of smoke began billowing into the air. And a river of lava poured down towards populated areas in the south of the island authorities ordered the complete evacuation of four villages, including El Paso and Los Llanos de Aridane. Video footage then showed the looming devastation as lava edged down from five five fissures torn into the hillside.  The Mirror told last month how red-hot lava could be seen on all four sides of the one-storey property but instead of engulfing the building, the river had opened up to leave a aposDapos shape around it.The owner of the home then said the building had finally succumbed to the lava, saying aposeverything is destroyed.aposRainer Cocq, told Spanish newspaper El Mundo from his permanent residence in Denmark: We have lost everything on our beloved island.

Lightning flashes were seen near the eruption early on Saturday.A study published in  found lightning can be produced during volcaniceruptions because the collision of ash particles creates an electrical charge.Airlines bound for the Canary Islands were advised to load extra fuel in case planes had to change course or delay landing because of ash, said a spokesman for Enaire, which controls Spanish airspace.

That is roughly enough to power the equivalent of , UK homes, in a country of more than six million people. An official said: The Lebanese power network completely stopped working at noon today, and it is unlikely that it will work until next Monday, or for several days.  They added that the state electricity company would try to use the armyaposs fuel oil reserve to operate the power plants temporarily, but that would not happen anytime soon. Many Lebanese normally rely on private generators run on diesel, although that is in short supply. Lebanon is suffering what the World Bank has described as one of the deepest depressions in modern history. Its economic meltdown has thrown three-quarters of the population into poverty and the Lebanese pound has lost % of its value in the past two years.  It is currently in the grips of a serious fuel shortage that has forced many businesses to close. Those not finding supplies through the black market have been left to queue up for miles to fill up their cars. The huge demand for fuel led to tragedy last month when a man died after swallowing petrol while trying to siphon it out of a vehicleaposs tank. In August,  people were killed when a fuel tank exploded in northern Lebanon where it was illegally stored in a warehouse.  While signicantly less severe, the UK is also dealing with a fuel shortage following a wave of panic buying. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association , said only % of filling stations in London and the South East have both petrol and diesel compared with % in the rest of Britain. He warned that fuel supplies are being sent to the wrong parts of the country. The Government insisted the situation is improving. Mr Madderson claimed independent retailers are being denied access to information from discussions between the Government, hauliers and oil companies. We do not know when the deliveries are arriving and we do not know how they are being prioritised, he said. Theto normal fuel volumes continues to be blighted by the current inept prioritisation policy.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

represents the iety of plant and animal le on Earth, and scientists say it is dwindling fast.ldquoMuch of the world has lost a large amount of its natural bioersity, said Dr Adriana De Palma from the Natural History Museum.ldquoThose systems have lost enough bioersity to mean that we have to be careful about relying on them ing in the way that we need them to.Researchers at the museum have developed the Bioersity Intactness Index , which measures the percentage of nature that remains in an area.The UKrsquos % BII places it in the bottom % of the worldrsquos countries and last among the G group of nations.The UKrsquos long-time low position in the league table is linked to the industrial revolution, said Professor Andy Purvis from the Natural Historyrsquos le sciences department.ldquoThat mechanised the destruction of nature to an extent, converting it into goods for profits, he said.vw,vw,px, px\"The UK has only % of its bioersity left, with species such as the red squirrel in decline The UK has seen relatively stable bioersity levels over recent years, albeit at a ldquoreally low level, Dr De Palma said.While the country has seen some increases in the amount of high-quality natural vegetation that helps support native species, those gains have been offset by the expansion of cropland and urban areas, as well as population growth, she explained in a press briefing.The UK can fix the problem, but ldquowersquod hope from a global bioersity perspective that that doesnrsquot come at the expense of just offshoring bioersity damage to other places, said Professor Purvis, who is a world-renowned expert on bioersity metrics.The team from the Natural History Museum hope their BII tool will help global leaders meeting for the UN Bioersity Conference, known as COP, next week.The conference, hosted by China, is set to take place online on October -, with a second round to be held in the city of Kunming next spring.Negotiators are tasked with agreeing a new set of goals for nature over the next  years.None of the worldrsquos last targets for protecting wildle, which were set in Aichi, Japan, in , were met.vw,vw,px, px\"Leaders meet next week at COP to discuss protecting nature across the planet, such as endangered Asian elephants ldquoThis is our last best chance for a sustainable future, Professor Purvis said of COP.He highlighted the need for action that recognises that developed countries have a stable but low level of bioersity intactness, while developing countries have a high level that is decreasing fast ndash a ldquoglobal levelling up.He said: ldquoBioersity loss is just as potentially catastrophic for people as climate change, but the solutions are linked.ldquoStopping further damage to the planet requires big change, but we can do itwe act now, together.ldquoMuddling through as we currently are doing is nowhere near enough to halt, let alone reverse, the ongoing worldwide decline in

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

Kick off is pm.For more information follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 8 2021","story":"I love how the green leaves of the trees slowly change into a golden yellow colour before the tree disperses of them and they gently fall to the ground.The tree seeks a time of rest in winter and therefore needs to let go of all its decayed leaves so that it can bud in spring and flourish in summer.Watching this process reminds me of an important lesson that we can learn from the trees as we enter into the autumn period and look ahead to the winter months.Just as the trees don#t stubbornly hold onto their dead leaves, so must we seek not to hold stubbornly onto any unnecessary hurtful weight in our lives.Ephesians  v  –  reminds us that we need to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Are you perhaps holding onto something that is preventing a freshness to the season ahead Could it be that the decayed leaves are piling up in your heart and you need to discard of them for good If so, why not reach out to the Lord in prayer because He longs to hear from you.Ask Him to reveal any thoughts, circumstances, issues, or any other #decayed leaves# that you may be stubbornly clinging to, so that you can release them and watch the leaves fall and drt away this season."},{"url":null,"title":"three points for pupils u17s after incredible comeback","story":"Campbeltown Pupils s ed to Kintyre last Sunday with three points after a remarkable Glasgow and District Youth Football League match.Trailing - with  minutes to go, the Ardshiel Hotel-sponsored side clawed it back and won - with an -minute winner.Despite a bright start, the Pupils were behind - after nine minutes.Two minutes later, it could have been - but for the brave defending of Kyle Paterson as he made a last ditch tackle which resulted in the youngster leaving the park with a nasty head knock # and not ing.This was a huge blow to the Pupils and worse was to follow as Cambuslang Rangers made it - from yet another set piece.Having weathered the storm, the visitors found their way back in to the game and reduced the deficit to one when Calum Ellis raced through on the th minute to make the half time score -.A positive start in the second half was quickly dampened as the North Lanarkshire side made it -.Ryan Shields closed the score line again as he raced through and showed composure with a fine finish, only to see the home side increase the lead to -  seconds later.Worse was to follow as the Cambuslang side made it - with a fine -yard strike.With  minutes remaining, it looked like the under-s were facing their first defeat of the season.However, there is a fighting spirit and never say die attitude in the teenagers that will serve them well as they develop into the adult game.With a spirited team display by every single player, Calum Ellis scored to make it - before pulling another back with  minutes to go.The equaliser was to follow on the th minute from Ellis before he scored his fth of the day with a penalty box scramble to make it - to the Campbeltown side.#This was a truly remarkable comeback in a game that will be talked about for many a year,# said manager David Paterson.The s have no game this Sunday due to the school holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days.

I donrsquot know how James McEnaney would fare in my colleaguersquos P test. She might well question the Class Rules authorrsquos front-line credentials: three years teaching experience at Arran High School and subsequent service as a college lecturer. She certainly wouldnrsquot question the ambition underpinning his book, subtitled The Truth About Scottish Schools. Like an educational Captain Kirk, McEnaney aims to boldly go and ldquofinally do what no-one  would: tell people the truth about Scottish schools. He promises: ldquoI am going to help you cut through the endless political grandstanding, media misrepresentations, statistical releases and pernicious class-based assumptions that obscure so much of Scottish education.Itrsquos not entirely clear who is being helped to do the ldquocutting through. Nevertheless, as befits an English specialist, James McEnaneyrsquos communication skills allow him to address complex issues, making them accessible to both professional and lay audiences. For example, he succinctly and convincingly describes the abuse of educational data to obfuscate rather than illuminate reminding readers of Disraelirsquos maxim on ldquolies, damned lies and statistics. Publication is well timed Class Rules arrives exactly  years after Ivan Illichrsquos De-Schooling Society. McEnaney is less of an iconoclast than the Austrian author he doesnrsquot reject schools or necessarily perceive them to be anti-learning. Nevertheless, he sets out to deconstruct the economic, social and above all, political and administrative structures that he claims limit schoolsrsquo effectiveness and fail a substantial proportion of Scotlandrsquos young people.As McEnaney suggests, itrsquos children from Scotlandrsquos poorest families and communities that get the roughest deal. Those of us who spent substantial parts of our careers working in Scotlandrsquos most deprived communities, will be underwhelmed to learn that ldquoattainment follows affluence and pass rates map postcodes. To be fair, McEnaneyrsquos perspective of the attainment gap goes far beyond examination data, taking account of gender, ethnicity, remoteness and additional needs. Itrsquos not all doom and gloom. He recognises the many good things happening in schools and classrooms up and down the country, but still describes a system that is ldquoboth in need of and ripe for radical, even revolutionary reform.Curriculum for Excellencewas a missed opportunity. Its transformative potential was bogged down and finally swallowed in a morass of conflicting detail and bureaucracy. The chance to provide teachers with greater flexibility and autonomy was wasted, as they were lost ever more deeply in a forest of Experiences and Outcomes. Put crudely, teachers couldnrsquot see the wood for the trees. McEnaney is in no doubt that responsibility for that and other current educational ills and injustices lies with Scottish politicians and pillars of the educational establishment such as Education Scotland and the Scottish Qualications Authority . Education Secretary John Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in particular, are accused of ldquoweaponizing education for political advantage. Education Scotland and the SQA stand accused of prioritising damage-limitation to their own embedded positions. Scotlandrsquos young people and teachers have become collateral damage, particularly during the pandemic-induced examination and certication meltdowns of  and .Politicising education is nothing new. Itrsquos almost quarter of a century since Tony Blair made his famouspledge on ldquoeducation, education, education. There was nothing inherently wrong with Nicola Sturgeon asking to be judged on education and her success in closing the attainment gap. She was guilty of misunderstanding, not necessarily misrepresenting. She and her advisers didnrsquot understand the depth and complexity of the question, let alone the answer. As with Blair before her, Sturgeonrsquos soundbite was a hostage to fortune and has proved to be the gt to political opponents that just keeps on giving.Unlike those opponents, McEnaney offers a wide range of constructive strategies to, ahem, ldquobuild back better. He rightly places teacher knowledge, skills and commitment at the heart of change and improvement. In Finland for example, where there is less control-freakery, teachers are empowered to develop and mody the curriculum to better match the needs of pupils and communities. McEnaney also places teacher judgement at the heart of a revised system of assessment and certication. That, of course, can be a double-edged sword. Teachersrsquo judgments are far from infallible and there are signicant workload implications.Litigious parents are a further hazard, especially should the child next door receive a better award. Nagging doubts remain about the readiness and willingness of teachers and the system in general to fully embrace the transformative intent of some of McEnaneyrsquos ldquoradical even revolutionary reforms. Systemic conservatism and inertia should not be underestimated. Therersquos more than a grain of truth in the old joke thata Scottish Rip van Winkle awoke today, the only thing he would recognise would be the secondary school curriculum.Parents, too, tend to be cautious about change, particularly those who prospered under the status quo and wish their offspring to do likewise. McEnaney would like to see greatly increased teacher numbers, reduced class sizes, more non-contact time for teachers, more technology, school entry deferred until age six or even seven, a national kindergarten system, Gaelic promoted and generally a broader curriculum offering greater access to the arts and outdoor learning.Wouldnrsquot we all  Unfortunately, McEnaney doesnrsquot say how his wish list relates to other ldquobuild back better priorities such as the NHS and social care, or how it should be funded. The proposed kindergarten system would be ldquomassively subsidised or entirely paid for through general taxation. Mm.Towards the end, McEnaney asks the fundamental question: whatare ldquoour schools, and our education system, actually for . Itrsquos a question that might have been asked earlier, as itrsquos the starting point for the debate urgently needed in our schools and beyond. If James McEnaneyrsquos thoughtful and readable book helps stimulate that debate, it will have made a valuable contribution."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13082563.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tim-burgess-charlatans","story":"Itrsquos what he does. He has been doing this for more than  years now.Most of the time those gigs have been with the band he fronts, The Charlatans. Today hersquos promoting last yearrsquos solo album I Love the New Sky. And remembering how to do this in the process.As with everything  last year, this tour was put on hold during the pandemic. So now, after an extended wait, hersquos rediscovering the pleasures of playing live.ldquoIt feels really great, Burgess admits. ldquoI think people are so excited to see live music and so attentive. Appreciative is another word I could use.I can imagine his bowl cut head nodding.ldquoThe rest of the band have gone in a sweaty van, Burgess tells me. But hersquos letting the train take the strain and talking to me about  years of The Charlatans, the tragedies and triumphs.But before we get there, we have to talk about Timrsquos Twitter Listening Parties. Like many others, one of the few consolations of my own lockdown was Burgessrsquos curatorship of artists and fans tweeting along to an album in real time.Night after night members of new bands and old bands, fresh talent and famous singers gave us insights into the making of their records. Burgess was the enthusiast in chief in all of this, organising the Listening Parties himself.ldquoI was getting phone calls daily. There was one day when I got a phone call from Roisin [Murphy], Ian Astbury and Gary Kemp all on the same day just asking me how it all worked.Tim BurgessThe obvious question is why he bothered in the first place  Why make the commitment to organise a Listening Party, and often more than one, nearly every night last year and on into this one. Had he just watched all his Netflix box sets ldquoI do get targeted by Netflix to watch things about unsolved murders. But there are only so many that you can watch. People could say that about albums, but I donrsquot agree. Every album is dferent andyou add a member of the band or somebody who is associated with the making of the record of the production or the artwork or whatever, then itrsquos very exciting and you learn a lot about how these things are made.What have you got out of it yourself, Tim ldquoWell, I had a deal with every single band where I would get . per cent of their Spoty, so I managed to get  quid that I split with  artists hellip he jokes, mordantly.ldquoI got a huge amount of enjoyment out of it. We played a lot of new bands who wanted to spread the word about their record and there werenrsquot many outlets at the time. But, also, there are records as extreme as Iron Maiden or Spandau Ballet that I hadnrsquot really paid enough attention to in the past and I really enjoyed them.The series is approaching its th edition. The week after we speak itrsquos confirmed that the album chosen is Blondiersquos Parallel Lines and Chris Stein and Debbie Harry will be involved.ldquoWersquore going to make a big deal out of it with a show at the South Bank, so itrsquos going to be live.The listening parties are set to carry on then  ldquoSince it began people have always asked when itrsquos going to end. Itrsquos the same thing with The Charlatans.ldquoI have no idea. It has changed shape so many times. Therersquos no sign of it stopping but there are signs of it changing all the time. Wersquoll just see what happens.Hair colour aside, you could be forgiven for thinking that Burgess, now , hasnrsquot changed at all since he emerged out of Northwich as a cherubic-looking -year-old with the Charlatans in .Next month sees a slightly belated, Covid-delayed, celebration of the bandrsquos th anniversary with a series of gigs that will continue through to December and the release of a ldquobest of album, A Head Full of Ideas .The Charlatans in Back in , when the band emerged as part of the then current baggy scene, you might have thought longevity wasnrsquot baked in. Yet The Charlatans quickly established themselves as one of the great single bands of the s, a habit that has continued into the st century . And thatrsquos before mentioning  albums.ldquoItrsquos been my le, Burgess says simply. ldquoI guess I was  when it started and there have been real intense times. Hugely rewarding moments and other times that werenrsquot so good.ldquoAfter Rob died there was real trauma, Burgess admits. ldquoWhen Wonderland came that was it, really. I know we made an album in between, but that was a stepping stone. When we put out Wonderland it blew any doubts.You go on because you go on  ldquoA lot of it is to overcome the challenge. There is that famous saying, lsquoItrsquos what he would have wanted.rsquo There was a lot of that.ldquoAll the work that Rob had put into the band beforehand why would it have to stop  Itrsquos something to build from really, and once you have that in your head space then itrsquos OK. Itrsquos just finding your way to make that work.ldquoAnd then with Modern Nature after John died hellip We couldnrsquot have made the record while he was alive because it was physically impossible for him and heart-breaking to the band.Le is a catalogue of loss, Tim. And Irsquom speaking from a few years on down the road.ldquoHow is it I wouldnrsquot be in any rush, I tell him.But letrsquos go back in time to the beginning. Why did he want to be in a band in the first place ldquoThe chance to say something about where I was from and what I was thinking and to be able to do it with people who had a real strength musically.ldquoRob had a vision that it would be Hammond organ-based, and he would create a sound that would be a little dferent from other Hammond organ players in the past. And I think we were all quite happy for him to lead the band at the beginning.ldquo We worked with Chris Nagle, who was a big part of the Factory sound with Martin Hannett, and he gave us more of a modern sound. We sounded quite sixties in the rehearsal room. He gave us a more dancey thing, which we were all interested in anyway. It was more of a nineties sound, and I think what he did for us really helped to make it more widescreen.Burgess admits that it took him a little time to find his own voice as singer. ldquoIrsquod always been in bands, but some of the stuff that I was into before was more Jim Morrison more Iggy Pop. We even did cover versions of the Cult in my band before.ldquoSo, I went with that in mind, and I remember Martin [Charlatans founder and bassist Martin Blunt] saying to me, lsquoOh letrsquos try this song again, but can you sing this time rsquoldquoWhat it did was stop me overdoing something and be quite relaxed. And I guess thatrsquos how I found myself.That was then. In the years in between Burgess has had his wild days, his rock star years, but he has never lost himself. How does he look back on that -year-old version of himself ldquoOh, very fondly, very fondly. Hersquos still there inside of me somewhere. I suppose being a dad as well brings all that back to you. It is a beautul thing.What he has also never lost is his enthusiasm. If anything, with the Listening Parties and his solo work, as well as writing books and running a record label, he has been more engaged than ever of late.ldquoTheyrsquore all part of me. I treat everything with the same amount of respect. You just keep at it, really. Itrsquos just enthusiasm for music.ldquoAnd thatrsquos how it started for me anyway, just a general enthusiasm for music. Other things got in the way ndash being in the music game there are a lot more obstacles than just the music.ldquoBut you donrsquot know that when you first start.As for now, despite derisory streaming payments, despite the challenges to gigging that every band is facing, he is still hopeful that there will be more new music and not just from him.ldquoHopefully bands start getting more than they are and maybe there will be something positive.I can only think like that that wersquore moving towards something that is better.Tim Burgess is getting on a train. Hersquos moving forward. Itrsquos what he has always done.A Head Full of Ideas is out next Friday.

The Carbost project is among  which were completed following lockdown with the Scottish Land Fund contributing more than poundm to help the buy outs.In Carbost, the shop never closed during the buy out process and villagers got behind it at the height of lockdown last year.Cathy Simon, one of the directors of the shop, said: \"Apart from the challenges of working our way through buying property during lockdown, covid showed us how important it was to have a community shop that would support our local village with essential supplies and help deliver to those vulnerable people shielding.ldquoOf course covid delayed the process required to go through buying a property but we are so pleased we did it, and we have made signicant progress since buy out this January with some essential repairs. We are so proud that we never shut the shop for one day with the transfer of private ownership to community ownership.The shop, housed in a  year old corrugated iron building, was bought by the community with a grant from the Scottish Land Fund of pound,. The SLF also supported the preliminary work required for the purchase, with community engagement, business planning and  monthrsquos salary of a shop manager.The property had been on the open market for several years as the previous owner sought to retire from the business. Following a public meeting in , volunteers Cathy Simon and Janette Sutherland formed a steering group with colleagues to work on the community buy out. The completion date for the sale of the property was initially set at April , right at the beginning of the first lockdown, but it was delayed until the successful acquisition in January .ldquoWe struggled during lockdowns, as everyone did, to get tradesmen available to help with essential repairs, but we have now improved the toilet facilities thanks to some fantastic local volunteers, added Mrs Simon.ldquoThe shop serves a community of  year round, and business increases signicantly with the huge numbers of tourists in the summer season.

But pupils had to also develop their presentation skills to explain their design plans to their peers.The Spaceflight Programme, run by the UK Space Agency, has invested over £M to develop three spaceports in Cornwall, Shetland and Sutherland. The UK will soon have the ability to launch small satellites from horizontal and vertical launchers operating from spaceports located around the UK, including the SaxaVord UK Spaceport in Unst.The work done by Shetland pupils will be submitted for judging, with the winning designs announced in the coming weeks.Head Teacher at Whalsay School Garry Spence said: “Our pupils have worked really well together in their groups and they’ve been fully engaged with this competition. They’ve learned a lot about spaceports and we hope some of them have been inspired to consider work in the space industry, which realistically could soon be in Shetland.”..Shetland is on the cusp of a major boost with the UK government ready to approve the creation of an isles spaceport in Unst – aTwo inspection reports have been ed for isles schools, providing mixed results.#Nothing has changed# in the race to bring a spaceport to Unst.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-. With their support, we successfully secured the funding to develop our Coffin Pod.“We are delighted to have now launched this into the market, and to have been awarded the Innovate NI Gold standard for this product. We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

However, the figures alone do not explain the cause of this increase, he said.I have tabled several follow-up questions to the Minister to seek clarication on the reasons for the year-on-year increase in these costs over the last five years — rising from £, in the   financial year to £, in  .A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “We have no evidence of a rising pest problem. “We take the issue of pest control in our properties seriously. When reported to us, our team triage pest control reports, treating each case inidually.“We quickly asses the nature, scale and severity of the request, based on the effect on our tenants and properties and engage pest control officers when necessary.“We receive around , requests for help and have been spending in the region of £, each year.”During a meeting of BCC#s People and Communities Committee last month, councillors hit out at the city#s truly disturbing pest problem.Sinn Fein’s Matt Garrett said: I had a tenant, a resident in my own area, in a Housing Executive property, who was walking about his house with a vacuum cleaner pole because his house was infested with rats.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsAndy AllenBelfast City CouncilMore On Andy Allen PremiumCost of living crisis ‘puts our most vulnerable people at risk’ PremiumCourts hand out over , speeding fines in five years PremiumCall to strip Capita of benefit payments role after firm fined £.m for failings PremiumFirst and Deputy First Ministers urged to explain delay in welfare mitigation legislation PremiumCharities need £m Covid- support now, Hargey is toldMost ReadFuneral held for Rodney Shirley, tragic father-of-four electrocuted at workSam McBrideOpinionLoophole may give DUP unorthodox way to keep first minister post evenSinn Fein wins electionI’ve lost all faith in the PSNI, says recruit attacked by her police trainee partnerBBC doc reveals new details about one of the most controversial killings of the  Easter RisingNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesLatest Northern IrelandDavid Jeffrey admits he ‘didn’t sleep a wink’ last weekend amid ‘toughest time’ of managerial career in Ballymena United slumpLoyalist terrorists behind wave of violence against own communityPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streets‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmerLatestWhat the papers say – October Gareth McAuleyOpinionJamal Lewis’ red card was very harsh… the referee got sucked in by Switzerland fansBusiness Secretary vows to keep energy price cap in place this winterSteven BeacomOpinionWhy always Northern Ireland against the Swiss  Here’s hoping there’s a dferent draw for the Euro qualiersLiam Smith stops Anthony Fowler in super-welterweight bout,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The UUP’s new party political broadcast is like nothing I’ve ever seen before from a unionist party.A child holding a hurling stick and a sliotar. A same sex couple. People from numerous ethnic backgrounds. A goth. Read MoreUUP’s Doug Beattie: Why I wouldn’t have posed with HutchingsUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug BeattieThere are no sober-suited politicians with stern faces giving off about the latest betrayal and warning that the Union is in grave danger. This is a positive, hopeful video that takes us across Northern Ireland from dawn to dusk. Mothers, fathers, farmers waking up and beginning their day. A young man going out on his morning run.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Children with Down’s Syndrome eating breakfast with their family. We see a teacher, a baker, a florist, a taxi-driver, a greengrocer, a shelf-stacker, a working mum — baby in her arms — as the day progresses.It all moves along to an upbeat song specially commissioned for the party. This is “Eurovision meets unionism”, as the commentator David McCann quipped. It’s utterly inclusive and the positive vibe is infectious.Even the opposition was impressed. Alliance’s Belfast Lord Mayor, Kate Nicholl, watched it with her two-year-old son. “He started crying when it stopped so we had to watch it again,” she tweeted.Doug Beattie has put clear red, white and blue water between himself and the DUP and TUV.The video is meant to reflect his ‘Union of the people’. Not unionists as they’re often represented in the media or by some politicians — always angry, negative, and fearful — but as ordinary folk living their lives the same as everyone . There is no single stereotype that fits.The mood in the broadcast is a million miles from that of angry protesters on the streets lambasting the protocol or those wanting to turn the clock back to another century.It’s grounded in Northern Ireland , and it’s forward looking. Never has a political leader in Northern Ireland altered the image of his party so rapidly.Beattie is just four months in the job, and the pace of change is phenomenal.There have been new, high-profile recruits an Assembly candidate from a working-class nationalist background and a drive to bring in more women, although the party has a long way to go on the journey to gender equality.Beattie will address his first annual conference in Belfast tomorrow. The most welcome guest will be hope.In just four months, the new leader appears on course to do what has eluded his predecessors over almost two decades — reverse the UUP’s decline.It has long been on the back foot. Despite Red Sky, RHI and the alphabet soup of scandals that have hit its rival, it has never been able to land a blow on the DUP.For the first time in a long time, there is excitement and confidence in the party’s ranks.The UUP is up from % to % in LucidTalk opinion polls since he took up the reins. That helps the new leader hugely. Success breeds success winning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.But there are dangers too. Some observers believe the ‘Beattie bounce’ is over-hyped. It’s one thing changing the party’s image and making gains in the polls. Transforming its fortunes by securing votes in an actual election is a trickier matter.The weight of expectation now lies on Beattie’s shoulders. He certainly can’t be accused of playing it safe. Every unionist leader at one point or another talks of the need to change, few have followed through.There are risks involved. How will the latest party broadcast go down with traditional UUP members in rural areas Beattie’s views don’t always chime with conservative grassroots members, although his personal popularity, military background and those positive poll results help him with that section of the party.But a good Assembly election result next May is crucial for his leadership.

Credit: Alan Currie Getty ImagesGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNearly two decades on from Lisburn achieving city status, UUP Alderman Jim Dillon has recalled how, in the lead-up to the decision being announced and celebrated with the popping of champagne corks, an official visit was made to the area by then Labour Secretary of State Dr John Reid.At that point, Mr Dillon was mayor, and had been forewarned by a civil servant that Dr Reid, now Baron Reid of Cardowan, had a two-hour window and “not a minute more”.This was two months before the Secretary of State’s visit, and as Mr Dillon noted, it was important Mr Reid left with a good impression, saying: “The Secretary of State plays a big part in it. The day he came and the two hours were up, the secretary walked over to him and said, ‘We need to go now’. He said: ‘Have you another packet of fags  I’ll be here at least another hour yet’.“I came back to my secretary an hour and a quarter later and threw my hands up in the air, [saying], ‘We’re going to get this, we’re going to get this’.”When the secretary asked why he was so sure, he replied, “I just got the vibes today”.The decision was announced by then Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in March  as part of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, giving Lisburn a lord mayor title as well. Other places across the UK received the title.For Northern Ireland, it was a tale of two cities as Newry was also conferred with city status, with Carrickfergus and Ballymena in Co Antrim, Coleraine in Co Londonderry, and Craigavon in Co Armagh missing out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up This year, the award is for the monarch’s Platinum milestone next year, and Ballymena is in the running for a third time, as well as Bangor.Those hoping to secure the title for their respective towns will, like Mr Dillon, be hoping for positive vibes this time round.Following the announcement  years ago, it was argued, somewhat cynically, that adding the word ‘city’ after Lisburn and Newry was simply an act of political expediency, with Lisburn pleasing unionists and Newry pleasing nationalists.Regardless, Mr Dillon insisted it was a good decision and extolled the benefits it has brought the area in the years since.“Some people will tell you that it has done a whole lot for Lisburn, and others will tell you that it’s done nothing. It’s as simple as that, but people who think it hasn’t [done anything] are not thinking people,” he said. “Cities have to start somewhere. [Modern] London started hundreds of years ago as a small town. It’s a multi-national city now. Lisburn is growing, and the problems we have are planning issues over the last while. We want to expand in dferent directions. Planning takes light years,it gets through at all.“I still think that getting city status was a good boost for Lisburn. It has allowed us to grow, despite all the dficulties. “People want to come and invest in us, simply because we are a city.”Has the award put paid to the perception some people have that Lisburn is merely a satellite of Belfast that will one day be subsumed by the capital The UUP alderman was adamant that would never happen.“In  years’ time, people will see what it has done for Lisburn. Lisburn is not a suburb of Belfast. Lisburn would never join up with Belfast. They are two very dferent places,” he stressed.“People can speculate, but it’s not going to happen. Lisburn is a very thriving place.”Former Newry and Armagh MLA Danny Kennedy was a councillor when he proposed the idea of Newry applying for city status.It was reported at the time that Sinn Fein opposed the move to become a city because of the award’s links with the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.Mr Kennedy remembers a more pragmatic response. “[While] it’s fair to say [the reaction] wasn’t exactly enthusiastic at the time, they had indicated that they wouldn’t object. It was initially a lukewarm reception from the SDLP but it became warmer,” he said, stressing that the combined unionist and SDLP support helped get the project off the ground.“What did help was the reaction and influence of the chamber of commerce. They [councillors] then quickly saw the benefits to the area.“People who were key influences in education and commerce, they in turn reached out to the wider community. “The application then took off and, crucially, avoided the political pitfall you would have thought would come with that.”In the wake of the announcement of city status, Sinn Fein’s Davy Hyland, at that point the council’s chairman, welcomed the decision, telling the BBC: “Royalism wouldn’t be a very strong aspect of le here. The main thing is the recognition that it is now a city.”The late Seamus Mallon, at that time the local SDLP MP, also praised the decision, saying it was a “great day” for the area that pointed towards a “bright future for the city of Newry”.“This is a great day for Newry and represents a strong recognition of the work which has taken place in the city in recent times,” Mr Mallon added.Jaded thinking, however, was a harder stumbling block to overcome, said Mr Kennedy.“Some people were cynical about that, saying that Newry was a town and would always be a town,” he explained.“People were cynical again when both Lisburn and Newry were awarded it, saying it was a political trade-off. People, to this day, still say that. I’ve no evidence for that.“There was genuine goodwill and they were able to assemble a group of businesspeople and sportspeople like [former Northern Ireland footballer] Pat Jennings to come on board. Figures who were recognised as leading in their fields.“It became the creature of the chamber, rather than the council. And that made it easier in some ways because it took the politics out of it.“If I got up every week and asked, ‘Any word from the Queen yet ’, that wasn’t going to work.”While he acknowledged that some people still do not see Newry as a city, he said the status had brought many benefits.“I think it’s worthwhile. You could stand on ceremony and say, ‘Now, hang on. They haven’t got two cathedrals, they haven’t got the population’,” he added.“It’s not on the level of New York and it’s not on the level of those great English cities like Liverpool and Manchester, but there is economic and cultural benefit to it.”A framed copy of the Queen’s certicate conferring the status hangs in Mr Kennedy’s home.“I’m proud of it. It’s not an exclusive achievement of myself, but I was happy to be involved,” he said.“Success has many fathers. I did propose it at council level, but I would concede that most of the spadework was done by the Newry chamber and others.”City status may be a thorny issue that falls along orange and green lines, but it can also reignite long-standing rivalries between towns. Ards and North Down Borough Council recently gave Bangor the green light to pursue city status, but it prompted consternation from councillors who represent other areas, including Newtownards.Alistair Cathcart, a DUP councillor for Bangor Central who proposed that the council support the application, insisted it was a “no-brainer”. “Why go for this now  Because the opportunity is now,” he said.“We simply don’t know when the next opportunity will arise. It’s been  years since the last opportunity. It could be another  or  years into the future for the next one.”Other representatives felt otherwise. Joe Boyle, an SDLP, councillor for the Ards Peninsula branded it “embarrassing,” while Angus Carson, a UUP councillor, denounced it as an April Fool’s joke, insisting Bangor was “going down the tubes”.DUP Alderman Stephen McIlveen, who represents Newtownards, insisted his issue with it went beyond the old rivalry between the two towns, saying it was more to do with what a city is in principle.“The process they have is that any town can apply for city status,” he said. “A lot of people will look at certain towns and think, ‘This does not fit my idea of what a city should be’.“The idea that you can have this process devalues what a city like Belfast or Londonderry might be. “A city should be an economic driver. The idea that somewhere like Ballymena, Bangor or the idea of Lisburn [as a city], a lot of people still cannot accept that because it doesn’t meet the perception of what a city is. Does that devalue what a city is ”Mr McIlveen stressed he would not support a similar proposal for his town. “I feel exactly the same way about Newtownards. I’m guessing thatyou spoke to a lot of people in Newtownards, they would feel the same way,” he explained.“The concern among the chamber in Newtownards is that Bangor,did get city status, it may adversely affect them. “While I’m a councillor for the whole borough, I am a representative for the whole Newtownards town and I have to advocate for them. “If they [Bangor] get it, great. It’s a tremendous honour to attain, but I’m not too sure that many people still consider [Bangor] worthy of being a city.”Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma agreed.  “I have lived in Bangor for over  years, I have raised my family in Bangor, I love living in Bangor, but I am from London, and Bangor is not a city,” she said.The idea of what defines a city is a concept that fascinates architect Mark Hackett, who operates a practice in Belfast and has written articles for Architectural Review magazine.He believes cities are made by citizens, rather than being made in top-down processes.“Just calling something a city doesn’t make it a city. It’s more emotional than that,” he said. “I’m talking about it more from an urban theory point of view. If you want to have a cohesive city, it needs to have a lot of things in it that people have a lot of pride in. “The ability for people to gather and express civic pride, or civic displeasure or dissent, is a very important thing. If you can’t do that, then it’s not a city or, indeed, a town.”What matters is not whether a place is a town or a city, he argued, but whether it is a “good town, a good city”, regardless of status: “It’s not about the aspiration of getting the title of city conferred from someone . It’s not important how other people decide what your status is. It’s how the residents are. Are they truly invested in their town or their city ”Alderman Audrey Wales MBE, who proposed Ballymena’s application at Mid and East Antrim council, believes the town meets the criteria and more.“Ballymena is a wonderful place. Our citizens are forward-thinking and hard-working, and it really does deserve to be a city,” she said.Itwins, it will be a case of third time lucky. As well as missing out in , Ballymena made an attempt in , when one UK town was to be granted city status to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.Although Ballymena was nominated on that occasion, it was later withdrawn.“Everyone is looking forward to it just as much as last time,” said Ms Wales.She also stressed there was no rivalry with nearby towns, with the application “fully supported by Larne and Carrickfergus”.As part of the process, applicants must demonstrate “distinct identity”, civic pride, heritage, history, tradition and association with royalty.Carrickfergus could have good reason to apply for city status, given its royal links. Along with its castle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Baron and Lady Carrickfergus titles were conferred on Prince William and his we Catherine by Her Majesty on their marriage in .While it was not nominated, Ms Wales believes the general feeling is thatBallymena were to be successful, it would have a positive effect on the wider area overall.It would also be somewhat poetic, given the town already welcomes visitors with a sign reading “Ballymena: the City of the Seven Towers” — a proclamation that reflects the spires that once defined its skyline.Ms Wales said: “We’re known as that, so it would be nice to get that status confirmed.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadFuneral held for Rodney Shirley, tragic father-of-four electrocuted at workSam McBrideOpinionLoophole may give DUP unorthodox way to keep first minister post evenSinn Fein wins electionI’ve lost all faith in the PSNI, says recruit attacked by her police trainee partnerBBC doc reveals new details about one of the most controversial killings of the  Easter RisingNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesLatest Northern IrelandDavid Jeffrey admits he ‘didn’t sleep a wink’ last weekend amid ‘toughest time’ of managerial career in Ballymena United slumpDrug dealing claims at bugged New IRA meeting to open old hostilities with INLALoyalist terrorists behind wave of violence against own communityPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsLatestWhat the papers say – October Gareth McAuleyOpinionJamal Lewis’ red card was very harsh… the referee got sucked in by Switzerland fansBusiness Secretary vows to keep energy price cap in place this winterSteven BeacomOpinionWhy always Northern Ireland against the Swiss  Here’s hoping there’s a dferent draw for the Euro qualiersLiam Smith stops Anthony Fowler in super-welterweight bout,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

This counted as P.E in the s. Long before the days of groups being brought out rock climbing or kayaking, the kids of the s were walking around the P.E hall trying to balance tiny beanbags on their heads. It never made it past the Olympic sport application, though, but we hold out hope. Teachers really had it handy back in the day! googletag.cmd.push The bin was a social hub... Getting continually chastised for talking in class was the bane of the existence of a s primary school pupil. We found a novel solution, however, as we all bought p pencil pairers and took full advantage of the rule that said pencils had to be paired at the bin and nowhere . The chats were had and many a firm friendship blossomed at the bin in the corner of the classroom. The school tour game was weak... In the s, school tours normally consisted of a trip to a local farm where the farmer was only delighted to welcome  screaming children to his place of work - NOT. We spent most of the day looking at cows and chickens, complaining about the smell, and the highlight of the day was bottle-feeding a baby goat. Those were the days, eh  What we would have given for a day trip to Tayto Park! The Don arrived... Whether it was by chance or design, for some reason on a random day during the s, artist Don Conroy from RTEs The Den turned up and drew an owl. We had to follow his instructions on a piece of copy paper and iniably ended up with a misshapen circle on top of an oval, after which we got distracted and went to the bin for another chat.     Mistakes were made... At one point or another, someone in the class made an absolute mess of the maths problems and proceeded to erase every screed of writing from his her page using a eraser. The smell of burning rubber wafted through the classroom asit was Mondello Park and poor Peters arm never recovered from the repetitive strain injury. What  could he do  Tipp-ex was strictly not allowed! Our books were routinely wallpapered... Covering school books was the order of the day because we all used the schools book lending scheme. You got the books that were used forty years earlier and in order to protect them, your poor mother had to spend the whole evening plastering them in wallpaper. Colours and styles did not matter to your beleaguered mother whatever wallpaper was left over went on, that was that! The telly was rolled in... REJOICE! At school in the s, the telly carried with it a God-like status. There was utter pandemonium when the teacher pushed it into class. The level of reaction could only have been equalledshe had pushed The Backstreet Boys in on a trolley. Absolute scenes! Iniably, the excitement dissipated when a farming or water safety video was produced, which was minus craic, but very important. Nevertheless, that momentary thrill of hearing its wheels squeaking down the hall and emerging through the door was the highlight of our primary school education. We had The News... In the very early years of primary school, we were required to write the news into our copies. The news was far from exciting and usually involved a classmates tooth falling out, trips to the zoo, or other random happenings in our non-eventful lives. In fairness, we were only five! Today is Wednesday...it is a rainy day. Accurate to this day! Ah, the memories! The Shatterproof Ruler Experiment... All of us, at one point or another, splashed out on the p shatterproof ruler from the school shop and conducted our own unofficial experiment to see could we actually shatter it. We proceeded to bend and contort the unsuspecting ruler furiously, our faces grimaced in anticipation of the impending snap. The experiment had mixed results. Some of us lost eyes due to the shrapnel, others were simply left with a bent-out-of-shape ruler in their pencil case with white strain marks down the middle. We had pencil toppers... These normally arrived free in cereal boxes and we upended the box of Corn Flakes in order to be able to go to school with a troll on top of our pencils – the absolute envy of the entire class. Trolls were popular but the toppers came in all shapes and sizes. Hey Arnolds head certainly made an appearance at one stage.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Acting through their solicitor, the Montagu Estate have issued a statement expressing regret that Portstewart Town Hall had been subject to years of neglect during its time under the control of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. googletag.cmd.push The town hall sits on a number of sites provided by the Montagu Estate to the Portstewart townspeople, and the family have said much of the land had been abandoned by those responsible for it. Ever since John Cromie named Portstewart in  he and his successors, now the Montagu Estate, provided lands for specic amenities for the townspeople of Portstewart, they said. This seems to have been forgotten over the years. Our predecessors provided the Cromie Institute, land for the Warren Playing Fields, the Primary School, the Headland, the Crescent foreshore, the Harbour and other many other parcels of land some of which are now in dispute as they have been abandoned by those to whom they had been endowed. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all. Independent councillor for the area, Angela Mulholland, said the community had reached out to the Montagu estate to attempt to find a solution.     The people of Portstewart are devastated at the prospect of losing our town hall, she said. We fully appreciate and share the disappointment and frustration felt by the Montagu family regarding Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils stewardship of the town hall. We,too, feelthattheCouncilhave notservedasgoodcustodiansofPortstewarttownhall,or asgoodpublicservantsof thecommunityofPortstewart. Wehavereachedouttothe Montaguestatetotrytofind awaytoreachapositive resolution. Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. When contacted, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said they intended to issue a statement on the town hall next week. After the Special Council meeting where they approved the hand over after seeking legal advice, Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. ”The ownership of Portstewart Town Hall has been under detailed consideration by Council for over two years,” he said. “In March , the Council made a decision which was not challenged using any of the normal channels, either call-in or rescinding motion. “That decision was to acknowledge the Montagu Estate’s Notice to Quit and the nub of the issue here is the ownership of the building. “While the council is progressing with the hand back of the building, the community is free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. “Preliminary work to establish the need for community space in Portstewart has already begun as proposed by council members.  Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.    Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future.

The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address.

Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table.

Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances.

She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions.

Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8803916.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularRoyal Military Police officer has recalled taking a rle from accused veteran Dennis Hutchings, but cannot confirm the weapon was his, a judge has heardNorthern Ireland gospel preachers arrested by Gardai are to go on trial in Republic of Ireland after preaching against homosexuality‘Unionism is led by gutless careerist amateurs: time for a clear out’‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’Assurance that the European Union in “solution mode” and willing to address trading dficulties caused by the NI Protocol has been welcomed by the DUP leader.Most PopularUK Government says it will press head with legislating for Irish language from WestminsterPSNI officer investigated for  years ... on word of Mount Vernon UVF killer Gary HaggartyIrish pupil numbers being in freefall is a sign a language act is not neededNo comment from new NI fire chief Peter O’Reilly as bomb inquiry evidence mountsVIDEO: Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith says the Northern Ireland Protocol should be replaced                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...And yet on reading the actual column Toibin wrote it was evident that the author had not deviated at all from his long time pluralistic, scrupulously fair and nuanced take on Northern Ireland.He started out by referencing the Queen and her historic, ground-breaking visit to the Republic back in . The novelist recalled talking to British diplomats a few months before she would arrive in Dublin. He remembered urging them not to compel herto use one loaded word — ‘sorry’. Toibin reflected in his article that, “The word ‘sorry’ was debased. Everyone was always sorry. Very few people who said they were sorry really meant it. Nor should the Queen express remorse or apology. The Queen in Ireland should not say anything that she did not mean.”Staying focussed on the Queen’s visit Toibin continued: “On  May  the Queen spoke with great delicacy and tact in Dublin Castle. She did not apologise for anything. She merely said something that happens to be true: ‘With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done dferently or not at all’.”Courageously, Toibin also challenged the cosy consensus in the Irish media that Brexit had somehow completely changed the matrices of relationships between Irish and British people, which appeared to reach such a positive apex during the royal visit to Ireland.“None of this was ever going to change after Brexit. Irish soccer fans will still support English teams Irish people still have cousins in England and go to England looking for work Northern Irish people will still see Scotland as close to home. England still represents freedom for many Irish people,” Toibin wrote.Excoriating not only Sinn Fein but also those politicians in Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties, Toibin warned against them wrapping the Green Flag around their torsos in order to harvest support from a younger, more neo-nationalist population south of the border.“Their talk of a united Ireland ‘in my letime’ is mystical blather, but it has the power to unsettle a fragile political environment. Also, it will do nothing to keep Sinn Féin at bay. “It will do nothing either to solve the more pressing and immediate problem of sour relations at official level between Ireland and Britain after Brexit. It is another example of politicians saying something they don’t mean.”In his column Toibin too recollected his visits to Protestant churches where funerals of murder victims took place in the IRA killing fields of Fermanagh during the Troubles. He reminded readers about the deep wounds inflicted upon border unionist communities during those dark days. His moving testimony, a powerful echo of his superb book about walking those borderlands in the s, was a welcome balm to all the waspish, stinging anti-Brit rhetoric that has infected southern Irish public discourse over the last few years.The novelist even had the guts to raise awkward questions such as why people in Northern Ireland would give up an NHS that is free albeit flawed to one that in his words is a “dysal health system” down south.Colm Toibin’s column was a welcome, realistic, refreshing intervention amidst all the misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’ in the post-Brexit era. It demonstrates that there are still voices in the Republic who maintain a sensible, pragmatic, nuanced outlook about Northern Ireland and especially towards the people there that still prefer to be part of the UK.His column originally in  was headline-neutral: ‘Will the Brexit fall out lead to a United Ireland ’, the paper asked.Toibin was at the very least sceptical about that prospect at present although you would never have known thatyou took The  headline over the same text as an indication of what the author was actually trying to say. Which begs more questions about the state of The  these days and its apparent abandonment of pluralism in both the states of Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They seem to have abandoned principles that were once the bedrock of the party, and have no conscience about it.More worrying, their members have bought into it.They are courting popularity, and in a world that has become increasingly secular this will earn its nod of approval, but that comes at a price!If you sell your soul, the devil always collects.Public opinion can be fickle!No doubt in the run up to the election they will resort to the old vote catcher: “vote to keep the other side out”.

While some of this has been the consequence of some political commentators not actually reading the invitation, others have been engaged in deliberately misleading the public.In particular, Fianna Fail TD Cathal Crowe’s statement on Clare Byrne’s RTE radio program on Thursday in tandem with statements from Sinn Fein TD’s were inaccurate.

It says and I quote: “The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past one hundred years, with the acknowledgment of failures and hurts, but also with a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation, and a commitment to the common good. The overriding theme will be that of ‘Hope’.”How can anyone claim that these words describe the event as a “commemoration”.It is therefore totally appropriate that we should participate in this ecumenical service.John Cushnahan, Ex Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP, Co Limerick——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Many countries worldwide have been partitioned and do not see a need for commemorations. They accept partition and live in the present.However, by refusing to attend the Armagh event, President Higgins seems to show a lack of acceptance of the wishes of Northern unionists to remain in the UK.

Barely any major political figure in the UK has ever criticised Ireland’s own shortcomings, and certainly not an apolitical figure in Britain, such as a member of the royal family.It is worrying to read of poll findings of public support for President Higgins, and his implicit endorsement of republican narratives on partition.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The Irish foreign minister has been at the heart of the greening of mainstream Dublin politics, and has taken a partisan nationalist approach to isive issues in NI such as the Irish language.While the Irish government, currently led by the thoughtful and admirable Micheál Martin, has defended Mr Higgins’ right not to attend, it is now clear that they actually think the president’s decision was regrettable.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Councillor Sam Nicholson.Businesses providing separatetoilets for male, female, disabled and baby changing receivea higher fee than those offering just one unisex toilet.The matter was originally tentativelydiscussed by the environmental services committee in November and December  before ing to the agenda in August  with an updated report on the matter presented to members of the committee on Tuesday, October .The community toilet scheme was initially considered as a way to deal with any potential shortfall in public toilet facilities in Portadown, however, the report notes the toilet facilities in Portadown ’s building on William Street are now operational and are under contract until April .With regards to a pilot for the scheme, the report suggests Lurgan and Portadown as two suitable areas.At present,Lurgan has four free to use facilities along with  pubs and caféswhile Portadown has eight free to use facilities along with  pubs and cafés.Members were also made aware that Derry City and Strabane Council launched its own Community Toilet Scheme in April  and have  participating businesses.Councillor Sam Nicholson asked businesses had previously expressed interest in the scheme but was advised businesses had never really been approached about the scheme by Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience.“It had been brought to committee on a number of occasions to seewe wanted to go to businesses,” said Mr Patience.“The only thing we have done is identy those locations so there is some detail for Portadown and Lurgan as possible sites for a trial.“We have not approached businesses yet. “Members had previously said they would be happy to hear more information about the scheme so this is us bringing that further information back.”Councillor Nicholson said it would be worth “asking the question” to businesses and proposed a workshop to discuss the potential objectives, scope and outcomes of any potential scheme.His proposal was seconded by Alderman Stephen Moutray who said it would be worth “exploring the merit” of this proposal.“This is potentially an opportunity to provide more facilities for people in our town centreswe go ahead with this,” he said.“As long as we are sure this has not already been discussed with businesses then I am happy to second the proposal that this is explored further in a workshop.”Read this:- Halloween back with a bangEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
