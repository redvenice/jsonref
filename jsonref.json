It’s been that way forever. I haven’t seen the cleaning brigade who go out and do the tram stops come in here, but I have seen that in other estates.”East of the Carlton estate, Penelope Drummond was watching the situation in Flemington and North Melbourne unfold on television from her north Richmond high-rise flat and feeling “very anxious”.She thought the cleaning services had definitely been improved in her building – one of five in the massive estate – but was worried about hundreds of residents being forced to share only two lifts.“There is cleaning going on in the lift. I see there are extra cleaners going around,” Drummond said. “Is it enough? No. Is anything enough?“A lot of people are wearing masks because they have heard that is the right thing to do in this environment.”Drummond agreed with calls for mobile testing to be brought to her estate. “I would like to think that would happen here as a preventative measure.”Later on Tuesday, Nine News reported a resident at the Flemington high-rise who had tested positive had also worked at the north Richmond estate, where he had patrolled three floors in one of the buildings.The state government is now facing calls from political opponents on its left and right for an increased testing regime in public housing estates.The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, whose electorate takes in most of Melbourne’s inner-city public housing high-rises, on Tuesday wrote to the government with his state Greens colleague Ellen Sandell calling for more resources and mobile testing.“There is no excuse for communal hand sanitiser bottles being empty for days on end in a pandemic or for lifts to be out of action,” he told the .“We also need priority on-site testing at these towers, so residents can be cleared of the virus as soon as possible and treatment given to those who test positive.”The left-leaning City of Yarra council was expected to pass a motion on Tuesday night calling on the government to provide mobile testing for all public housing residents, among other measures.Stephen Jolly, a veteran councillor in Yarra, where there are 12 public housing high-rises, said residents were worried there was nothing being done to prevent their own estates facing a hard lockdown.“We need testing,” he said. “And if someone tests positive, it shouldn’t be that we lock down the whole tower. We don’t do that for private blocks of units.”The Victorian Liberals’ housing spokesman, Tim Smith, said there should be “compulsory testing in all public housing”.“If anyone tests positive in public housing, they must be immediately quarantined in either hospital or appropriate crisis accommodation,” he told the NCA Newswire.But Ranko Cosic, a community leader and resident at the Atherton Gardens estate in Fitzroy, baulked at the idea of mandatory testing.He said bringing testing to residents in the public housing flats was a “very good option”.“I think the residents should have a choice, otherwise it comes across like you’re being forced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f2598cf1297d2aae0e14965fd1cb4ddc56860a2/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=61cf84f14c154ead0d57802e39594ef0","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

Once the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union, trade with the bloc, the UK’s largest export market, will become more difficult, even if the two sides reach a deal. The commission said failure to reach a deal is “an important risk” that would be “particularly negative for the UK”.So far, the impact of the coronavirus downturn on employment has been less bad than some feared, which the commission attributes to short-time work schemes that have kept people in their jobs on reduced hours, a policy stance it contrasted with the US, where unemployment claims have surged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df1496d8f5dd53bed177e6bd3059097262488a1/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dba04ff81cdd92d9e99df8defd594846","title":"thousands of jaguar land rover logistics workers to lose jobs","story":"DHL to lay off 2,200 workers on JLR contract as calls grow for UK government support package for car industryThousands more UK workers involved in making Jaguar Land Rover vehicles are set to lose their jobs, despite the embattled car industry returning to production after coronavirus shutdowns.The job cuts will affect full-time and agency staff involved in shipping parts to, from, and within plants across the north-west and Midlands. Jobs will go at all at JLR’s major factories, including Castle Bromwich, Solihull, Ellesmere Port and Halewood.The news come just weeks after Tata-owned JLR, Britain’s biggest automotive company, announced it would cut 1,100 agency jobs, after losing £500m in three months as the pandemic halted production and closed car showrooms.Last month, industry body the SMMT warned that up to one in six UK automotive jobs were at risk without a dedicated government support package.DHL said: “In light of highly challenging trading conditions in the global automotive sector and the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our linefeed and freight operations supporting the Jaguar Land Rover contract.“We are now in consultation with our employees and their representatives and will make every effort to redeploy as many colleagues as possible to our other operations nationwide.”Draper said the union was awaiting details of proposed efficiency savings but warned that DHL should not “force staff to undertake impossible workloads as they show other workers the door”. It called on JLR to step in.He added: “While DHL is the employer, the reality is that the workers perform their roles for JLR. JLR has a moral duty to ensure that workers are treated fairly and decently during this incredibly difficult and stressful time.”A JLR spokesman said: “DHL informed us that they were going into consultation with some of their workforce last month.“Through its ongoing transformation programme and against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaguar Land Rover is taking action to optimise performance and achieve further operational efficiencies to enable sustainable growth and safeguard the long-term success of our business.”JLR had already been grappling with major problems in the years before the pandemic, including sales ing in China in 2018-19 and demand falling in the UK through what it described as the “headwinds” of Brexit and consumers avoiding new diesel vehicles.The latest UK automotive manufacturing job losses follow cuts at Aston Martin, Bentley and Nissan since the pandemic started.

The 2016 agreement, which imagined CGN’s “progressive entry” into the UK’s “resurgent” nuclear ambitions, was given maximum hype at the time by both Beijing and David Cameron’s government.But here’s the good news: unlike with Huawei, where a ban would seriously disrupt 5G rollout in the UK, there are few direct downsides to excluding CGN. The UK does not need Chinese nuclear technology.The major impact would be at Bradwell in Essex, the prize CGN was really seeking – the first Chinese-built nuclear plant outside China.But the Bradwell proposal is years away from being approved, and already looks surplus to need for the reasons the National Infrastructure Commission offered in its most recent long-term assessment: “Given the balance of cost and risk, a renewables-based system looks a safer bet at present than constructing multiple new nuclear power plants.”The NIC thought only one new big nuclear plant needed to be commissioned before 2025 – and that, presumably, will be Sizewell. Cancelling Bradwell would involve no real sacrifice on the part of the UK.In fact, the CameronOsborne nuclear vision has aged horribly in four years. The offshore wind revolution has accelerated and the industry’s costs now beat nuclear’s every time. If replacement nuclear capacity is still deemed essential for baseload purposes, the aim should be to build as few mega-plants as possible.Advances in battery storage technology should further tilt the economics in favour of renewables. While we wait, small modular reactors look a nimbler nuclear alternative. Rolls-Royce is in the development vanguard on that front, and carries no geopolitical headaches.In short, for purely business reasons, one would rip up that 2016 agreement in an instant.Online fashion retailing is a fast and furious place, as Boohoo should know at the flick of a few switches, its clothes have been delisted from the websites of Next, Asos and Zalando.The industry’s response is impressively speedy – and far clearer than the confused messaging from Boohoo’s boardroom in response to allegations of illegal pay rates at a factory in Leicester producing its clothes. The factory may have been operated by an unauthorised subcontractor, as Boohoo said, but that’s not an excuse it’s up to the retailer to control its supply chain.A temporary loss of sales on a few third-party websites may be tolerable, but Boohoo’s breezy image will suffer permanent damage if this saga drags on. Mahmud Kamani, founder and executive chairman of Boohoo, needs to get a grip.He should do what most observers are advising: appoint an outside auditor or lawyer to examine what went wrong. The failure to take that obvious step looks more perverse by the day. Does he also need Next \u0026amp co to give him lessons in how to manage a crisis?There’s a deficit in the pension fund, it should be said. But three times earnings is still a spectacularly gloomy assessment of long-term prospects. That’s not to say it’s wrong, of course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07777a22be399ed742225036468bdc8059d3c01d/0_58_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfd042f4bc9e98eac5a80db701d4963","title":"rishi sunak mini budget leftwing labour coronavirus public spending state ownership political agenda","story":"The impact of coronavirus on the economy means high public spending and state ownership are top of the political agendaBack in December, a major plank of the Conservative party’s general election strategy was to portray Jeremy Corbyn as a Marxist throwback, committed to all sorts of dangerous 1970s lefty ideas such as state ownership and higher public spending.Six months later, Boris Johnson felt the need, when announcing plans to bring forward £5bn of investment in Britain’s clapped-out public infrastructure, to reassure voters that he was “not a communist” and still believed in capitalism.It’s easy to see why the prime minister felt the need to provide some reassurance to his party’s traditional supporters, who believed the Conservatives stood for a small state, free enterprise and sound public finances. Johnson has nationalised the railways, is paying the wages of about a third of the workforce and is on course to borrow more this year than any other prime minister in peacetime. If Corbyn had announced that he was prepared to take a stake in strategically important companies to stop them going bust, Johnson would have been the first to accuse the former Labour leader of “picking winners”. In a Covid-19 world, it is what the government does, if more out of necessity than conviction.Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on the economy on Wednesday is another indication of how things have changed in the first half of 2020. Normally chancellors are tight-fisted in the first year of parliament, getting all the tough decisions on tax and spending over with early so that they can hand out some goodies as election time approaches. They certainly don’t have mini-budgets where they announce that money’s no object if it means saving the National Theatre, or preventing the dole queues from lengthening to four million by the end of the year.To be sure there are experts – Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England for one – who think that the economy is recovering more quickly than expected, but the risk for Sunak is of doing too little rather than too much. His decision to end the government’s furlough scheme in October – when the jobless total is likely to be rising fast – is a colossal gamble and, quite possibly, a huge blunder. State spending takes on extra importance when unemployment is rising because the threat of redundancy leads people to save more. The drop in private spending makes the recession worse unless the government compensates by spending more itself.Michael Devereux, an Oxford university professor, says Sunak should consider topping up the wages of people who have returned to work but are operating at below full capacity, which makes sense given that it will take a long time for many businesses to return to normal trading.It is unlikely to happen though. In part, that’s because of traditional Treasury concerns about handing money to employers who might not need it. It’s also because this is a government that feels queasy about many of the things it is being forced to do.Thus far, there is nothing historically exceptional about what Johnson’s administration has been doing. Governments in the past have expanded the role of the state. They have used fiscal policy – tax, spending and borrowing – aggressively during recessions. They have bailed out troubled companies. They have argued that higher spending on infrastructure will pay for itself by shifting the economy into a higher gear.The problem for the Conservatives is that parties of the left have traditionally been more comfortable pushing these policies than parties of the right. Johnson likes to talk about his brand of one nation Conservatism, but somehow or another he has ended up with an economic strategy rather like that of Harold Wilson’s 1964-70 Labour government, with its National Plan for growth, high levels of public spending and belief in the transformative power of science and technology. It is certainly not Thatcherism, which is why free-market thinktanks are uncomfortable with the government’s direction of travel.For the time being, there is not much those who think Johnson’s dalliance with dangerous leftwing ideas will end in tears can do about it. They can point out that in some ways the lockdown has highlighted the strengths of the market, with many businesses finding all sorts of creative ways to keep themselves going. They also make the point that the way the government has handled the crisis – from its Soviet-style targets for testing to its chaotic air bridges – has not always been the best advertisement for an activist state.Politics goes in cycles and there will eventually be a moment when that thinking resonates with the public, but not now. For the moment, if the opinion polls are to be believed, voters are far more receptive to more stimulus and a rolling back of welfare cuts. The Resolution Foundation thinktank’s proposal for a £200bn spending boost, complete with £500 of spending vouchers for every adult, is far more in tune with the public mood than a return to austerity.This is not entirely surprising. As the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said on Tuesday, a pandemic is the ultimate collective action problem: it is simply not feasible to tell workers and companies that they must survive on their own as best they can when the government itself has been responsible for shutting down the economy.Nor is the mood likely to change all that quickly. The recession of the early 1990s was cured by Britain leaving the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Pouring money into the banks was the turning point in the financial crisis of 2008. This time, only a vaccine for Covid-19 will do the trick, and that could be years away.All of which creates a glorious opportunity for the Labour party. It is in the happy position of being able to say that no matter how much the government is spending it should be spending more. It can pick and choose from all the once taboo ideas – such as a basic income, a wealth tax, or printing money to pay for higher public spending – that have become fashionable. A green new deal is now so much part of the mainstream that the prime minister sees himself as the new Franklin D Roosevelt.A word of caution, though. Even assuming that Labour embraces the need for more radical action on global heating, it is not actually in power and won’t be for some time. The government has four years to patch up a dysfunctional economy which, despite all the rhetoric, is what Johnson’s strategy is really all about.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5df1c236a0f811fdcc4c7d1e17ff0a9db25fd9b/34_99_1407_843/master/1407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f33afff35b168a635ddf4d834586684a","title":"expecting amy schumer pregnancy docuseries hbo","story":"In Expecting Amy, the comedian navigates marriage and a grueling pregnancy with her trademark candor, but what’s most compelling is left just outside of the frameAmy Schumer, the 39-year-old comedian and actor, spends much of Expecting Amy, the three-part docu-series on her turbo-charged first year of marriage, pregnancy and the development of her 2019 Netflix special Growing, hunched over and vomiting. Afflicted by hyperemesis, or acute morning sickness, Schumer braced against unrelenting nausea and a good thousand or so hurls, many of them filmed by her husband, sister or friends. There’s the comic, hours before a show, puking into a plastic bag, out the door of a car, into the toilet bowl at 3am a day before she’s to tape Growing at a comedy club in New York, she’s in the back of another car on the way to the ER, dehydrated and retching. “Oh shit, what about the taping?” her husband, the chef Chris Fischer, whom she married on Valentines Day 2018, asks from the front seat. “That’s seeming a little unlikely,” she manages, as she hasn’t kept down food or water for days.The HBO Max series, directed by Alexander Hammer and Ryan Cunningham, is, like much of Schumer’s comedy, a record of excess – in this case, of sickness, a body in revolt and, less prominent but richer, the demands of forwarding a highly public career throughout. Filmed from the fall of 2018 through 2019, the series is billed, in name and in structure (the first two episodes, available for critics, are titled “Conception” and “Gestation”) as a pregnancy series, one channeling Schumer’s longstanding brand of fearlessness, carnal humor and dicing of post-feminism’s hypocrisy and obfuscation into behind-the-scenes documentary. (Schumer and Fischer’s son, Gene, was born in May 2019).But like her recent comedy, the raunchier or more bodily transgressive things get, the less she seems to say. Expecting Amy works best as an exploration of comedy’s messy boundaries – what personal interactions get filtered, streamlined and edited into a set, what off-stage moments of wryness and levity form a stage persona, what shame or fear performance can excise or exploit. The series eschews any talking heads or much formality at all, instead relying on on-the-fly footage of Schumer and often Fischer, sister Kim Caramele, and friends Rachel Feinstein and Bridget Everett in cars, bathrooms, trains, splayed on backstage couches, on stage.Watching Expecting Amy, you get the sense that being “on” is not so much an act as who Schumer is bedridden in the ER for dehydration after days of vomiting, she’s still joking to her sister, disarmingly straightforward with the nurses. If she ever had a conscious onoff performance switch, she long ago lost track of it. But while Schumer’s brand of exposure and flouting taboos is boundless – one episode intro finds her sitting on the toilet in her hospital gown, half-asleep, struggling to pee – Expecting Amy stops short of revealing much about her clearly dauntless ambition, or grappling with the scrutiny of millions like Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana, Schumer’s series is most interesting not in the bulk of what is revealed, but what moments are hinted, seemingly off-hand, or left out.Expecting Amy convincingly portrays her as an Everywoman – stars puking through pregnancy, they’re just like us! – except Everywomen don’t get emails from Netflix greenlighting their proposed special while eating takeout. When celebrity and critique do encroach the frame – when she smiles and spars with a man taking photos of her on the train to Long Island, for example – the friction with Schumer’s roll-with-it disposition is palpable, fascinating, jarring.There are moments which seem to lead to a whole other series, tension aired but tantalizingly underexplored, particularly in regards to Fischer’s diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder (formerly known as Asperger’s), which occurs over the course of filming and is movingly embraced by the couple. Schumer, used to mining her personal life for jokes, frequently brings up Fischer’s sweetness, his as she calls it “different” brain, in her sets. But after one bit in which a gift intended to make her feel better is played to audience laughs, late in the second episode he broaches the subject, seemingly uncomfortable but not expressing so in as many words. “It’s not a normal circumstance, the circumstances that we have,” he says. “We’ve also talked about the separation between the performance and your art and your act with reality, too.”Schumer reacts defensively, more so to her marriage’s strained communication than her comedy. “Are we celebrating how strong you are, or are you telling me that you have a problem with me saying something on stage?” she says, adding: “My standup is not more important than our marriage.” The argument loops over, its threads picked up and put down, and feels raw and treacherously vulnerable in a way the many shots of Schumer’s nausea do not one wonders what those conversations of the line between reality and performance looked like.In press for Growing last year, Schumer seemed to embrace a life in evolution, in the potential for comedy’s thorny expansion. “I’m ecstatic and furious,” she told the New York Times. “And pleased and peaceful and manic and hopeless and so hopeful it’s crazy.” In its best moments, Expecting Amy embraces this kind of mess, of contradictions, blurred lines between reality and performance and self-awareness – “I know how I am, no one else can deal with it, I know that,” she tells Fischer through tears. But as her special hinted at the strains of work, fame and motherhood and then punted to familiar terrain of bodily excess, too often Expecting Amy reels back into what, for Schumer, is familiar, profane terrain: raw, underseen and unsparing, often frankly funny – an on-brand expansion of genre covering for growth left out of the frame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1753ed75ee695013cfc342d58749c2a99f5a8c52/0_11_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3e9b22b3a8abbff075e12a5da51f8041","title":"lady hale on her brexit brooch you can do a lot with a spider","story":"The former president of the supreme court discusses standing out in a male-dominated industry – and the story behind the infamous pin she wore for the prorogation judgmentThis outfit – a dress and the brooch – epitomises the sort of look that I have when I’m sitting as a judge. I wore this black crepe A-line dress, with velvet bands across it and a rather pretty stand-up collar, for the prorogation decision, but the black spider brooch in this picture is a different one.The spider in this photograph lived on that dress and I had decided that it was the appropriate dress to wear for the prorogation judgment, but when I got it out of the wardrobe the spider was no longer there. It had obviously dropped off at some point and I couldn’t find it, so, because a spider lived on that dress, I looked in my drawer and found another redder, silvery, sparkly one.A lot was made of my wearing that brooch on that day. I know that Madeleine Albright was quite deliberately giving messages with her brooches – she has written a lovely book about it called Read My Pins I’ve got it. But I wasn’t giving any sort of hidden message – I’m not a politician, so I don’t play any part in politics. If I had realised some of the things that people might have speculated, then I would probably have worn an innocuous bunch of flowers.I started to wear brooches when I was in the family ision of the high court. I was wearing, on the whole, dark suits and my husband started buying me brooches to lighten them. The first brooch he bought for me was a spider. I don’t think there is any particular reason I have so many spider brooches. The spider is a very good artistic theme – you can do a lot with a spider. The same is true of frogs, I have a lot of frogs.Of course, once one person sees you wearing something, then other people – members of the family or friends who want to give me a present – start giving you much the same. And so the collection grows. I don’t know how many I have, but there are a lot.None of my brooches are worth very much they are all costume jewellery. The infamous spider brooch was from Cards Galore it cost about £12. They are mostly creatures of one sort or another. Bugs, beetles, a dragonfly, a fox and a nice little cat. But I think to say I was a fan of the natural world might be putting it a little high.I tend to wear them more in London than I do up here in Yorkshire. I haven’t been wearing many brooches in lockdown, because I’m not going out anywhere. But I have been trying to keep presentable – I’ve got quite a lot of new casual clothes, like jeans and tops from Joules comfortable, but not jogging bottoms or pyjamas.People comment on women’s appearance much more than they comment on men’s, but I recall in another case most of the press comment was not on what I was wearing during the hearing – it was all on one of my fellow justice’s ties.

At least, that’s my excuse for this monstrosity, which looks more like a 70s Doctor Who villain than a white sandwich loaf. Anna Stanford, PR and communications manager, LondonLike everyone else, I thought I’d give baking bread a go during lockdown – not because bread was scarce, but simply to fill the time and make my flat smell nice. I spotted a recipe for beer bread online that looked super easy and used a can of beer instead of having to do anything fiddly with yeast or starters. But the loaf took on a life (and limb!) of its own – I call it my arm bread. It tasted dreadful. Baking bread is not for me.I joined the sourdough revolution during lockdown after seeing a friend’s amazing loaves. My first loaf, however, was a total brick. The starter wasn’t lively enough but, because I was attending a Zoom online baking class, I had to just crack on. When I started making the dough, it just got stickier and stickier. I felt very disheartened and my second attempt was no better. The dough was still sticky, but I read that you could turn it into focaccia, so I tried that. It was still awful. With too much time on my hands and a recent gift of a huge box of cherries, I thought I’d try making a cherry clafoutis. Despite following the recipe, perhaps with just a couple of improvisations, I ended up with what my niece described as looking like something I had already eaten! Even a sprinkling of icing sugar failed to redeem it, but a dollop of vanilla ice-cream did help it go down.My oven broke at the start of lockdown, leaving me and my flatmate to get creative using the hob for a few weeks. (Fried frozen pizza, anyone?) As soon as it was fixed, I went on a baking spree, which was mostly successful, but with two notable failures: the world’s flattest scones (I blame the recipe) and a funfetti cake. The cake was going well until I added the buttercream icing before it was fully cool. Cue melted pools of butter and soggy blobs of cake. It seemed easy enough: make pistachio bars from scratch, rather than using the packaged bright green pudding. It looks lovely in the photo, especially with the sprinkling of crushed pistachios on top, but instead of the pudding being an appetising shade of green, it best resembled poured concrete (in colour, thankfully not in consistency) sandwiched between two layers of cream cheese. I started baking a couple of months ago as a form of therapymindfulness and have mostly been successful. I usually share my baked goods quite proudly with friends. This time, I waited until the cover of darkness to hand it out – it tasted fine, just looked terrible! A dessert best enjoyed with one’s eyes closed.My sourdough-discard crumpets proved disastrous. I got a bit overconfident having finally figured out how to bake a decent sourdough loaf during lockdown – I even made crumpet rings using beer cans to be mega–sustainable – but it became a squidgy, half-burnt mess. They didn’t taste bad though, all things considered.I was experimenting with vegan baking and decided to try meringues using chickpea water. Covid-19 has made me acutely conscious of food waste and I wanted to make the most of my tin of chickpeas. Sadly, I didn’t whip the aquafaba and sugar for long enough (you need to do it until your arm aches … and then some) so they disintegrated in the oven. It looked like I had microwaved a ghost. This is not my bake, but my fiance’s. I had a lockdown birthday, which was mostly fun, and Tom decided he would make his first-ever cake for the occasion. I checked in on him at one point and warned him not to overbeat the mixture – despite it looking like he might have already done so. Our oven also cooks quite hot … It was meant to be a lemon drizzle loaf and I was obviously effusively grateful, but as cakes go, this was definitely a first attempt. Dense, claggy, burnt. That’s love! I decided to make some cheese scones but they tasted really dusty. It turned out our flour was more than 10 years out of date – and had even moved house with us more than seven years previously.I named my sourdough starter after my late dad, as it produces something nice but crusty. This seemed appropriate. I’ve trawled through recipe books and am now speaking a new language of leavens, levains and autolysing. The kitchen is covered in a fine dusting of flour and my husband has put on a stone. I’ve made one passable loaf and one that was as flat as a pancake. I had one that refused to leave the warm embrace of the floured tea towel and this one, which stuck resolutely to the cooking pot. I’m now on to loaf five and if this one doesn’t work then Dad will have to go in the fridge and lie dormant until I summon up the enthusiasm to bring him back to life.Never a confident cook or baker, I have in recent years – now being a parent to a three-year-old – begun to be more adventurous and bold with my kitchen endeavours. I had been enjoying some moderate success in the muffin department. Suitably encouraged, and bolstered by a recent 3kg delivery of then-rarer-than-gold-dust flour, I set out to bake my first cake from scratch. I measured, I sweated and I watched as it baked words cannot describe the pride I felt when I brought out a perfectly baked cake. Worried that I might damage it in my excitement to put it on the cooling rack, I made the fatal error of giving it to my partner to extract ... who promptly tipped it all over the floor. This is Ruby Tandoh’s seeded loaf, or rather seeded brick. I think I let the second prove go on too long and it collapsed with a disappointed sigh when I slashed it. Definitely my fault, not Ruby’s – her walnut cob has been among my top lockdown bakes. Surprisingly, the brick tastes OK when toasted, so I’ll try again. Like yeast, I rise!I thought making a layered strawberry, raspberry and vanilla cheesecake would be a piece of cake. However, the recipe and instructions differed slightly to my usual recipe and I was torn as to which to follow. I went with the new recipe, but didn’t add gelatine, as I’ve never done this. When I tried the mixture, I could not taste any of the fruit flavours, so (without thinking) I added more fruit. I think it was this that led to my disaster of a slopped cheesecake. The flavour was delicious, but the base was so hard that I couldn’t even pull it off as summer fruit mousse. I will be following my usual recipe next time.I somehow managed to score an enormous bag of flour, so decided to satisfy a serious craving for a proper Devon cream tea. This is my first (ever) attempt at making scones. They made a lovely jam and cream sandwich ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7268f6b15c99278585027824f8468e9a275dda5e/99_1539_4262_2556/master/4262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e90cd0df986aa0c019f13520f47852","title":"nigel slater recipe lamb with tomato coconut and coriander","story":"A gorgeously simple, succulent and meaty curryAn uncomplicated curry.

Against a Crystal Palace team with nothing to play for – neither Europe nor Premier League survival – they surged into a two-goal lead.At that point, the notion that this derby would become nervy for Frank Lampard and his players felt outlandish. They were fluent on the ball and, in the quicksilver, Christian Pulisic, who scored the second with a thunderous hit, they can boast one of the ision’s in-form players.But the problem for Chelsea is that they must play both ways and, when they are defending, they can look altogether less secure. When Wilfried Zaha unleashed a firecracker than sizzled through Kepa Arrizabalaga, the under-pressure Chelsea goalkeeper, it was the prompt for a contest to break out – one that Lampard’s team would ultimately edge to keep them on course for a Champions League finish but only after dicing with disaster.Tammy Abraham, on as a substitute, had made it 3-1 only for Christian Benteke to respond immediately for Palace and Chelsea would waste chances for 4-2, most notably through Abraham, before the dramatic finale.During five minutes of stoppage-time, the visitors looked incapable of killing the ball and closing out the game and they almost paid. Scott Dann headed against the inside of the post from a Zaha cross after Abraham had surrendered possession and there was also time for Kurt Zouma to make a saving challenge on Benteke. The full-time whistle brought relief for Lampard.Roy Hodgson had made the point beforehand that his Palace squad was not set up to cope with the fixture congestion, saying he knew it would be an “uphill struggle” and the strain contributed to them falling behind.When Reece James played a pass up the inside-right channel, Gary Cahill was the favourite to get across to it ahead of Willian. Then, rather abruptly, he was not. Cahill felt a stab of pain in his hamstring and slipped down onto the turf in agony, unable even to watch as Willian streaked away and cut back for Olivier Giroud to finish. The former Chelsea defender would be helped off.Should Willian have kicked the ball out? No. For all he knew, Cahill might only have slipped and how silly would he have looked then? Willian was in full flight and it took only a couple of seconds for him to centre for the goal. In that kind of moment, players are simply not wired to stop.The breakthrough calmed Chelsea. There had been a wobble from Arrizabalaga in the second minute when he shanked a clearance straight at James McArthur, who was 40 yards out. The lob was on for the Palace midfielder but he could not execute.With Billy Gilmour preferred to Jorginho in front of the back four, Chelsea settled into a patch of passing rhythm. Zouma blew a free header from a Willian corner – a glaring miss – before the latter combined with Giroud to play in Pulisic on the left-hand edge of the area.Pulisic has bristled with menace since the restart and he had too much swagger for Joel Ward, darting outside him and unloading a vicious shot high into the near corner. Vicente Guaita was beaten by raw power.With Willian forcing Guaita into a fine low save, it was difficult to see a way back for Palace and yet the home team found one. It followed a sloppy turnover by James but when Patrick van Aanholt nudged a deflected ball square, it was all about the ferocious power in Zaha’s right foot. He looked angry and he channelled the rage into the shot from 25 yards, a celebration of technique which ripped past Arrizabalaga and into the roof of the net. The goalkeeper appeared to have it within his sights but he could do nothing about it – a bad look for him.This Chelsea team is prone to stumbles and Palace finished the first-half in the ascendancy, with Zaha pepped and Benteke heading at Arrizabalaga. You sensed Chelsea needed another goal and Giroud ought to have scored it early in the second-half only to send a free header high from James’s cross.What had to worry Lampard was how easily Palace were able to play up to his backline. His midfield did not provide enough protection. Chelsea nerves jangled when Zouma had to block from Jordan Ayew after a poorly defended corner.Lampard introduced Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Abraham and, almost immediately, the former played in the latter to shoot low and in off the far post. But Chelsea were in no mood to make life easy for themselves and nor were Palace. The home team went straight up to the other end through Van Aanholt, who beat Andreas Christensen too easily, and crossed for Benteke to tap home. The grandstand finish was on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e6ef060a2509591ce579ac9caae68ff6ef46c11/162_15_1764_1060/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a4e9e50b3374614d78cd6ca369374a","title":"watford norwich city premier league match report","story":"Here’s a pro tip, from an extremely amateur footballer. Shouting “time” at a player in possession – a staple of the grassroots game I am gratified to report is just as prevalent at the elite level – is not, remarkably enough, going to calm him down.Screaming at a teammate they are under no pressure is not the best way of relieving said pressure. Meditative pauses for reflection are rarely provoked by having half a dozen grown men desperately howling at you from 60 yards away.And yet, as Watford edged past Norwich to take a giant leap towards safety, you would hear it being bellowed from the sidelines again and again, from well-meaning substitutes and coaches. “Time.” A rushed clearance. “Time.” A pass straight out of play. This, as much as anything, was the dominant backdrop to a game defined by a state of permanent panic, an icy anxiety gripping both teams like a virus.You could argue neither of these teams were very good. Certainly this would be true of Norwich: a side capable of such elegant football in possession but often a gibbering, blubbering wreck without it. Of the many truly useless teams in Premier League history, Norwich are by far the best of them: cultured, ambitious, and yet likely to be relegated with three games to spare. They will be the Championship’s most likeable club next season.Watford are a more complex proposition. This was undoubtedly a huge win and yet so laboured and inept was their performance, so permeable and porous their defence, that it offered their supporters zero reassurance before far tougher tests: Newcastle, West Ham, Manchester City, Arsenal. You wouldn’t really back them to win any of those four. With Aston Villa and Bournemouth still blundering behind them, they may not have to.It was Danny Welbeck – the one genuine star on the pitch – who provided the game’s one moment of Zen. Ironically, as Ismaïla Sarr’s rushed cross bobbled up in the air after Max Aarons’s botched clearance, all of a sudden Welbeck seemed to have all the time in the world. He used it to line up the flight of the ball and execute a perfect bicycle kick, pinging into the top corner and giving Tim Krul no chance: a goal worthy of winning a game far better than this.This was Welbeck’s first Premier League goal in almost two years, and the hope must be that his injury traumas are finally behind him and we may once again glimpse the player who briefly looked such a fresh and streamlined talent when he emerged in the late-Ferguson era at Manchester United.You even wonder if might not be better deployed up front rather than on the left wing. Certainly he looks more of a threat at present than Watford’s leaden captain, Troy Deeney: Watford’s main point of attack and yet one who would either drop deep to receive or simply hover without doing very much, like a silent consonant, the “g” in phlegm.To give him his due Deeney played his part in Watford’s equaliser, cleverly peeling away from his marker just as Etienne Capoue’s free-kick curled in from the right and allowing Craig Dawson a free run at the ball. Still, Alex Tettey should probably have done more to impede Dawson’s header, and coming in the 10th minute it was a soft way for Norwich to surrender the precious early lead given to them by Emi Buendía. His goal was an early portent of the way Norwich were simply able to run at Watford’s backline with little resistance: a curling effort after a surging run by Onel Hernández.Even after conceding the equaliser, Norwich continued to enjoy sporadic chances. Teemu Pukki – remember him? – flashed just wide. Ben Foster saved from Aarons with his feet. The trouble was that the longer the game went on, the more Norwich looked like doing something extremely stupid at their own end.Welbeck and Abdoulaye Doucouré had already squandered good chances by the time Welbeck spectacularly put Watford ahead 10 minutes into the second half. And so to Norwich’s last stand, a glorious slapstick finale in which these flawed teams threw everything at each other, and occasionally themselves.For Watford, Adam Masina sliced a clearance over his own bar. For Norwich, Adam Idah missed from four yards. At one point, Aarons tried to take a quick free-kick to Ben Godfrey, who wasn’t looking.The irony was that these weren’t actually bad footballers. They were good footballers gripped by a paralysing terror: a fear of making the crucial mistake and thus blinkered to the possibilities around them. So many clever runs went unseen by teammates and unmarked by opponents.This, perhaps, is the biggest difference between the best teams and the rest: flow, rhythm, malleability, vision, the ability not just to play the pass but to play it at the right time, or play a different pass at the last possible moment.As the whistle blew for full time, Mario Vrancic tried to clear the ball to the stands in frustration. He miscued it and sent it trickling into one of the advertising hoardings. Watford wildly celebrated a win that has bought them valuable time. Alas, Norwich’s is almost up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347575b002e721f5f4de211363e1d53e07a99258/0_302_3624_2175/master/3624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829c0cfb3cf549af8e80d670751be6fe","title":"arsenal v leicester city premier league live","story":"25 min: Aubameyang flies don the left and tries to repay Saka’s assist with a well-aimed cross of his own.

Somehow the stadium looks bigger without fans (insert joke here about it also being louder, if you must). If Leicester win here despite being deprived of Maddison, Chilwell and Pereira, it will be a humungous achievement. They will need a big game from Tielemans, who’s brilliant but has been off the boil for a while. Arteta on his team selection, specifically starting Bellerin and Lacazette: “We have to rotate players, we need fresh legs. Everyone is doing well. “ Chelsea’s 3-2 victory over Palace earlier today means Leicester have been shunted down to fourth in the table, with this match at the Emirates in hand. “Yes, it’s all looking terrific for Arsenal,” booms Charles Antaki. “Even in the 2003-4 Invincible season, the team only managed 4 or more consecutive wins twice, so a victory here would put this lot right up there. The good times are certainly, unmistakably, definitely back. Surely?” I certainly can’t think of anything that could possibly go wrong now at Arsenal. Absolutely no reason to be nervous about Vardy v David Luiz ...Leicester have not won away to Arsenal since 1973 and today’s team news makes for ominous reading for them. James Maddison and Ben Chilwell have not made the fitness cut, two key absentees. Ryan Bennet’s first start suggests they’re going to play with a back three, as they did in the second half of the win against Palace, with the supreme utility man Marc Albrighton likely to act as a left wingback. On the plus side, that could be a potent front three if the service is right.As for Arsenal, it looks like they’re also going with a back three, and why not, it has served them well in recent weeks. It’s the formation in which David Luiz looks most secure: it’ll be fascinating to see how he deals with Jamie Vardy today, as the the striker has bedazzled him in the past. Up front, Alexandre Lacazette gets the nod at centre-forward, with young Nketiah on the bench, along with Nicolas Pepe, who’s available again. Hello. What a doozy of a game we have in store here. The relegation brawl has its appeal, but the race for Champions League qualification is the most intriguing unresolved story in this Premier League season. Today’s duel will have a big say in how it plays out: given the quality of the other teams challenging for the top four, neither Leicester or Arsenal can afford to lose.That Arsenal are even being mentioned as top four contenders is a tribute toOnce vilified players such as Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi suddenly look valuable and gifted youngsters such as Bukayo Sako and Eddie Nketiah have raised hopes of great things ahead. OK, it’s only four matches but it’s been enough to sow optimism in an Arsenal swamp of despond. Before the league resumed they were in ninth spot, eight points off the top four. Now they are seventh, seven off the top four. Small but tangible progress. Beat Leicester and belief would really swell.The progress of Leicester, meanwhile, has been one of the feelgood stories of the season but, just as a top four finish started to look certain, their form has dipped. They got back on track with a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace last weekend but they have yet to truly sparkle in the way they did earlier in the campaign. Will that win over Palace help them get their back groove? Or will Arsenal make their nerves jangle even more? That is what we are here to find out. Humdinger ahoy!

It’s a twinkle-toed delight, but he can only beat so many men and is eventually crowded out on the edge of the box. He’s a proper player.82 min: Jorginho is immediately involved, drawing some pretty triangles with Mount and Willian, then snapping into a 50-50 challenge with Benteke. Chelsea look a little calmer already.80 min: Chelsea further bolster their midfield by swapping the inexperienced Gimour for Jorginho, making his first post-lockdown appearance. Palace respond with a double change, replacing McArthur and Ayew with McCarthy and Townsend.78 min: Willian backs himself in a footrace down the right with McArthur and Milivojevic ... and nearly wins it. The Palace men did very well to keep up there. Chelsea are forced to turn tail.77 min: McArthur floats a pass forward to Benteke, who backs into Zouma, then falls over and claims a penalty. The referee is quite correctly not interested in the slightest.75 min: James crosses from the right. It’s dangerous enough to earn a corner. Willian takes long. Sakho, at the far post with his back to goal, does very well to adjust and clear. Palace break upfield, Ayew working his way down the left. But he over-elaborates and runs the ball out for a goal kick. We may only have 15 minutes plus stoppages to play, but good luck guessing the final score of this.74 min: This match is great. That’s Benteke’s first goal here since April 2018, 24 long games ago.Palace come straight back at Chelsea and close the gap! Kouyate and McArthur combine down the left and slip the ball inside for Van Aanholt, who glides into the box, drops a shoulder to get past Azpilicueta, reaches the byline and rolls across for Benteke, who can’t miss!Chelsea launch a counter, and it’s so simple. Loftus-Cheek races down the middle. As he reaches the box, he intelligently waits and waits, hovers and hovers, drawing Dann and Sakho before chipping cutely between them for Abraham, who threads a shot across Guaita and into the bottom left. Lovely goal!70 min: The game restarts. Palace are immediately romping forward. Zaha dithers awhile out on the right, and it looks like all momentum is lost, but suddenly he whips a cross into the centre. Benteke tries to connect with a spectacular volley ... but doesn’t.66 min: Loftus-Cheek is quickly in the thick of it. He should be sent racing down the inside-left channel by Mount, but the pass is a little bit behind him and he can’t gather it smoothly. The danger - Palace were light at the back - is gone.65 min: Chelsea make a double change, in the hope of regaining control of midfield. Barkley is replaced by former Palace loanee Loftus-Cheek, while Giroud makes way for the more mobile Abraham.64 min: Nothing comes of the second corner.63 min: Ayew bustles down the left and wins a corner off James. Milivojevic hits it long. Neither James nor Giroud manage to hack clear. Ayew tries to swivel on the penalty spot and smack goalward, but his effort is blocked out for another corner.61 min: Milivojevic is good to continue, though he’ll have a shiner of a left eye later this evening by the look of it.60 min: An extended break in play as Milivojevic is given the once-over by the quack, having run slap-bang into his team-mate Ayew’s knee while falling over.58 min: Another cross from the right by James, who looks a threat every time he moves up the flank. This one’s not quite as good, headed clear easily enough by Sakho. But what a prospect James is. A fine attacking full-back in the up-to-date style.56 min: Palace are beginning to dominate now. Even factoring in their slow start to the half, they’ve had 64 percent of possession since the restart. 54 min: This game is back to its first-half, end-to-end best. James crosses from the right, a magnificent delivery that lands on Giroud’s head, six yards out. He must score, surely, but blasts his header over the crossbar. He pulls his arctic-blue jersey with disrupted herringbone knit over his face in monochromatic despair.52 min: Ward and Kouyate work their way down the right but can’t find Benteke in the middle. Chelsea race up the other end, Barkley flinging a raking diagonal towards Giroud, just inside the box on the left. Giroud attempts a cushioned header to tee up Pulisic, but the flag goes up for offside.51 min: Van Aanholt takes a speculative dig from 25 yards. The ball smacks Willian straight in his startled face. Ooyah, oof, ow. That will have been a sore one. He’s given some time to recover.49 min: A little better from Palace as Ward and Benteke combine on the edge of the box to release Ayew into a little space on the right. But the resulting cross is no good and easily mopped up by the visitors.48 min: Chelsea shift the ball from left to right at speed. James is found in space down the channel, and fires a low centre towards Pulisic at the near post. Sakho, sliding hysterically across the turf, does enough to get in the way and Palace clear. The hosts haven’t really got started again yet.46 min: Chelsea are quickly on the attack, James opening his legs down the right and swinging in a cross that’s easy for Guaita.Palace get the second half underway. Neither manager has made any half-time changes.... and some real good listenin’. Enjoy, enjoy!Pulisic continues to torment Ward, this time winning a free kick near the left-hand corner flag as he tears past him. Mount’s deep delivery is headed clear by Dann, and that’s the end of a riotously entertaining first half. It fair flew by. More please!45 min +2: Chelsea are extremely ragged now, and could do with hearing the half-time whistle. Kouyate is bowled over by Gimour, 35 yards out. Milivojevic curls the free kick onto Benteke’s head the big striker flashes a decent header goalwards, but straight at Kepa, who gathers with safe hands.45 min: There will be four added minutes.44 min: Ward curls viciously from a tight spot on the right. His cross pings off the top of the crossbar, Kepa flapping under it in panicked confusion. Turns out the ball had curled out of play before hitting the frame of the goal, but Chelsea have to be worried about the form of their keeper. He doesn’t exude solidity.43 min: On the touchline, Roy Hodgson strokes his chin in the pensive fashion, mentally composing his half-time team-talk. It’ll be a damn sight easier after that Zaha belter.41 min: Suddenly Chelsea aren’t quite as potent when they get the ball. Palace have done extremely well to fight their way back into contention.39 min: McArthur makes it to the byline on the left and hooks a dangerous low ball into the mixer. Azpilicueta is forced to hack behind for a corner, and he looks concerned, Chelsea’s defensive travails at West Ham presumably flooding back into an addled noggin. From the corner, Dann loops a header harmlessly wide. This game is great fun.38 min: What a way for Palace to score their fourth first-half goal at Selhurst this season, though, huh? Now for the next target: matching their season’s best 90-minute total of two. Anything’s possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c44c430a21819f1fdfebdb7dd35b259a432b0ea/489_620_4095_2457/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdd640f85b63614ade10f06edb39879d","title":"bumi thomas glasgow born singer given two weeks to leave uk","story":"Despite living much of her life in the UK, the jazz musician became a victim of the hostile environment policy. She talks about her fight to remain – and strengthening her rootsDuring lockdown, UK jazz artist Bumi Thomas has found space to spread out in her local park. “I take my guitar and howl,” she laughs. “I love it!” As the world starts to understand just how much black women feel they have to reduce themselves, it’s soothing to think of a carefree Thomas filling public space with highlife and jazz melodies.She tells me about a Peter Adjaye livestream she’s been dancing to and speaks with what she calls a “transatlantic twang”, a blend of a Hausa accent from her years living in Nigeria, the place of her parents’ birth a distinct international-school American lilt and strands of Glasgow and London. Then there is the influence of Yoruba, “a very deep and brooding language that comes from a different part of your mouth and body,” she says. “I learned it later in life singing Fela Kuti songs. And there’s a connection to the blues I grew up singing, like Miles Davis and Muddy Waters.”Last year, Thomas was preparing to bring that rich voice to bear in a performance in LA with the Moroccan visual artist Hassan Hajjaj. The next day, she woke up to a letter and felt the earth give way. Thomas was born in Glasgow in June 1983 after the British Nationality Act was passed by the Thatcher government in January that year it stated that children born to parents from the colonies were no longer entitled to automatic citizenship. The letter informed Thomas – who has lived in the UK solidly since she was 17 – that she had 14 days to leave the country or make herself subject for deportation or detainment.“I couldn’t believe what I was reading” she says. “I felt nauseous. I sat down everything was spinning. It was terrifying. There’s a section at the end that says: you do not have the right to work, you do not have the right to rent property, your bank account can be frozen. It’s like someone is suffocating you.” LA was off she started making calls. “I picked up the phone and heard myself telling people, ‘I just got my refusal.’”Thomas was one of thousands of people with roots in former colonies, including the Windrush generation, who were made suddenly precarious thanks to a renewed “hostile environment” policy. She had, like many others, assumed she was a British citizen with dual nationality – the 1983 change “was not well communicated to the public in the UK or in the colonies”. After all, her sister, born in the same circumstances but before 1983, was British.Community activists crowdfunded Thomas’s legal fees, created a petition that drew 25,000 signatures, and alerted the media. An immigration tribunal judge ruled in favour of withdrawing the threat of deportation, but she must wait two years before she can apply for British citizenship. Her status is still at the mercy of a isive immigration policy.During this period of statelessness, somehow, Thomas was writing songs. They ended up on Broken Silence, her gloriously joyful jazz EP, out last month. On it, she defines herself not by the language of the British state but in the power of ancestral sounds across the African continent and beyond. She describes the devotional-sounding udu drum that appears on Black Child with reverence: “A vessel used by Igbo women to fetch water from a stream, and based on the amount of water in it, it has this fantastic bass sound and you can tune it to different tones.”The hostility of the Home Office renewed an urge to root herself in her own history. In the early 70s, Thomas’s parents owned a hair salon in Glasgow called Hairlynks, the site of significant black music history that attracted artists and creatives, and saw a young Sade singing there, according to the memory archives of locals. “Before that, if you were in the Highlands, you’d have to go to London to get your hair done,” Thomas laughs. Through the shop’s sound system, the young Thomas took in the rhythms of a black artistic community through the braids and chatter.Further back, she discovered her father’s Afro-Brazilian roots dating back to the 19th century, and the musical hangover of Nigeria’s historical Portuguese occupation. On Lesso Lesso, she pays homage to this, singing in Portuguese, English and Yoruba, featuring a sample from her dad sent over WhatsApp voice notes. The loose translation of his Yoruba instructs her: be careful with your heart, go gently, gently.Gently advocating for black joy feels radical in a world often unsympathetic to global black trauma. For Thomas, this moment of mobilisation chimes with her own personal battle with a system that has uprooted her sense of home.“At times, the music feels likes protest,” she sighs. “When I sang before, it had meaning, but not the same resonance. I went to a Black Lives Matter protest a few weeks ago and someone had a boombox and played A Change Is Gonna Come. It is all … emotional.”She takes a breath. “I’ve been feeling so much. You are forced to choose to shrink or expand yourself.” For now, she chooses expansion: taking her guitar to the park, singing songs that cross borders, restricted by nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service. But as former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell argues, it is easier said than doneWhen Jonathan Powell arrived in Downing Street in 1997 as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, he was met with a handshake from the head of the civil service. From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate. For Jonathan Powell, the acid test will be whether Gove can deliver on these words, which have echoes back to the 1960s and Harold Wilson’s government’s promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa3da11ba180745d661ebb324983c977082cc6b5/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1635fea033e4ada0641aade9d5f128af","title":"my online business flourished the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut down","story":"Kaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

We are listening, noticing and looking much more,” she says. “Hopefully, people will continue to do these things now lockdown is easing, which can only benefit nature and our health.”Craig, who turned 18 in May, is thought to be the youngest person to have seen half of the world’s birds. Yet for the past three months, she has had to content herself with birdwatching on her doorstep, in the Chew Valley, south of Bristol, where she lives with her parents. “We have been really lucky as it is really beautiful here with lots of places to walk from our doorstep,” she says. Her mornings consist of school work done next to a window overlooking the birdfeeders or outside in the garden where she can watch the birds much closer. Afternoons are spent on birdwatching walks.“The highlights have been seeing 11 red kites above a field, a cuckoo calling from the woods above our house, and a red-necked phalarope at Chew Valley Lake, the first time that one has been seen there,” she says.But Craig is not just a birdwatcher: she’s also an activist, running nature camps for teenagers to introduce them to the natural world. With RSPB sites beginning to reopen, Craig is passionate that wildlife and nature should play a vital role in the nation’s mental health as lockdown eases.With new figures showing growing mental ill-health among young people, Craig believes connecting with nature is important as we are part of nature and need that connection to “relax, cope with anxiety and stay mentally and emotionally well”.For those without access to a garden or park, she says: “There are lots of things you can do to connect with nature through a window – such as watch the sunrise, listen to the dawn chorus, watch the clouds, watch the sunset or the night sky. You can plant herbs in a container and put them on a window ledge, put a birdfeeder and some water somewhere you can see them outside, or just watch any wildlife you can see in trees or bushes.”Young people from a black, Asian and minority-ethnic background are much less likely to live in rural areas, or have access to urban green spaces. And studies show that Covid-19 affects their mental health more than their white counterparts. Craig, who is part-Bangladeshi, is angry, though not surprised, at the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on non-white people, especially those of Bangladeshi heritage who have been dying at twice the rate of white people. “I think it is hugely worrying,” she says. “As a family, we have decided to carry on staying at home and my gran is going to carry on totally shielding.”While she recognises that there are some clinical and socio-economic factors behind these “shocking” statistics, Craig also believes “outright racism” plays a part - that Bangladeshis are too often perceived as “moaners” or “hypochondriacs”. “I have seen this with my grandmother, who is not taken seriously unless she has someone with her who will argue the case for treatment for her,” she says. “Lots of people don’t have an educated or confident family to do that for them.”Craig has been campaigning for years to improve ersity in conservation work. She got into nature because her parents are both keen birders and says that when she was 13 she noticed that there were hardly any other non-white faces on birdwatching trips. “Being part-Bangladeshi is what made me realise what a lack of ersity there was in the first place.”So in 2015, she set up a nature camp for 20 teenagers, and the seeds of her not-for-profit Black2Nature were born. So far, she has run nine camps for eight- to 11- and 12- to 19-year-olds. More than 200 children have taken part, and for some it’s the first time that they have seen a cow or sheep except on a plate. The aim of the camps is to encourage community cohesion as well as an introduction to the wonders of the natural world. It’s a “lot more than just birdwatching and mammal-watching”, she says.So what does she think of the Black Lives Matter movement? “It’s a really important campaign and one that those of us who are not black need to openly state our support for,” she says. “Black people are being killed and abused in the US and the UK, which needs to stop.“I think that we need new criminal laws for racially aggravated murder, attempted murder and assault. This needs to be supported with funding to support those being excluded from school and society.”Craig shared a platform with Greta Thunberg when she visited Bristol in February, and has organised conferences with the celebrity nature lovers Bill Oddie, Chris Packham and the RSPB chief executive, Beccy Speight. As one of the few non-white people in this field, she hopes she can be a role model. “It makes visible minority-ethnic young people think about nature and its possibilities when someone who looks like them is interested in it,” she says.Growing up, she travelled extensively and says she has “seen first-hand a lot of the impacts of climate change, deforestation and discrimination”, which gave her an interest in conservation and indigenous people.In 2021, she hopes to to volunteer with birds and indigenous people in the US before going to university to study politics and international relations. She also plans to run eight nature camps and hopes in the future the camps will be able to run without being reliant on her and to expand beyond Bristol.Locally, Craig says the pandemic lockdown has significantly improved the environment. “The disappearance of people and vehicles has halved pollution in Bristol city centre, regenerated our rivers and, with coal-powered stations shutting down, made our electricity carbon-free. All of these are great signs that we build on.”With her A-levels cancelled due to coronavirus, Craig plans to have August off to spend time with friends, and then go birding with her parents in Shetland and the Isles of Scilly in the autumn. Until then, she is still looking for birds in the Chew Valley and beyond.Family: Lives with her parents.Education: Chew Valley school plans to go to university in 2021.Public life: Founder and organiser, Black2Nature ambassador, Survival International, Tree Charter UK.Interests: Birdwatching, blogging, dance, guitar, vintage and second-hand shopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168a353022e4cf9924539915e0dd3b30be84a202/0_163_2901_1740/master/2901.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7c41c33649d070c0e487b1c0dbd7c183","title":"rafael nadal unlikely to defend us open title amid madrid masters clash","story":"Rafael Nadal is highly unlikely to defend his US Open title when the rescheduled grand slam tournament begins on 31 August, after confirming on Tuesday that he will play in the Madrid Masters, which starts on 13 September, the day after the final in New York.“I talked to my friend @RafaelNadal and he has confirmed his participation in Madrid next September!” the world No 56 and Madrid director, Feliciano López, tweeted. “We wait for you as always with open arms in the Magic Box!” Nadal replied to his Spanish compatriot: “See you in Madrid in September. Meanwhile everything goes well!”The Madrid and Rome Masters, which starts on 20 September, are the key warm-up clay tournaments before the French Open, rearranged to begin on 27 September. They are also the fiefdoms of the 34-year-old Nadal, who has won 12 titles at Roland Garros, as well as five in Madrid and nine in Rome. He defeated Daniil Medvedev in the final last year to win his fourth US Open title. However, uncertainty about quarantining for players returning to Europe remains a significant disincentive to travel to New York for many on the ATP Tour, which has been suspended since March.Nadal and the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, are among many contenders for the US title who have expressed reservations about playing in New York during the coronavirus pandemic, doubts that were strengthened when the city’s marathon was cancelled last month.Andy Murray has said he is keen to play at Flushing Meadows, where he won the first of his three major tiitles in 2012, and had intended to also play in the Citi Open in Washington on 14 August.The EU has been giving regular updates on quarantining requirements and several European players are waiting for clarification before committing to travelling to Washington, the first warm-up event for the US Open, which has incorporated the Cincinnati Open in its expanded schedule.There is a feeling among many whose realistic ambitions do not stretch to winning the US Open that they are better off playing in the two pre-Roland Garros events, in Madrid and Rome, rather than risking complications getting to and from Washington and New York. A reliable source at the ATP told the  on Tuesday: “That is a big question at the moment. It’s still not a clear picture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376ea47f36a5279a241e00eb3f597fbe5c58475f/49_216_2401_1441/master/2401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69d1bd23a41976ac8f6e17f3bf26e875","title":"womens golf boosted british open gets go ahead for august royal troon","story":"Women’s professional golf has been handed a boost after it was confirmed the British Open will take place as scheduled this summer. The event, which will run from 20-23 August at Royal Troon, is to be played without spectators.While the PGA Tour has been back in operation since early June and its equivalent in Europe resumes later this month, leading female players have enjoyed no such competitive leeway. That is thought to have been prominent in the minds of the R\u0026ampA, which now presides over the Women’s British Open. It will be the first women’s major of 2020 because of Covid-19 disruption.Emphasising the strict guidelines that will be employed, the R\u0026ampA said in a statement: “The championship will enforce strict health and safety protocols including the creation of a biosecure zone. Only personnel essential to the championship’s onsite operations, namely players, caddies, officials and staging staff, will be inside the zone, with their movements for the week limited to the golf course and designated secure hotel.“All personnel will be required to return a negative Covid-19 test from an authorised testing centre and will be subject to further daily temperature checks and rigorous protocols designed to maintain the integrity of the zone and the health of those within it.”Nigel Huddleston, the UK sports minister, said: “Getting elite women’s sports back safely remains a top priority. We’re working hard to ensure we don’t lose any of the great momentum that has built up in recent years.”The Ladies Scottish Open has also now confirmed it intends to proceed behind closed doors, at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian from 13 August. That co-sanctioned tournament will be the first on the Ladies European Tour since mid-March. The US-based LPGA Tour is set to return at the Drive On Championship in Ohio from 31 July.“With men’s professional golf back playing, it is important that we are able to follow suit,” said Catriona Matthew, Europe’s Solheim Cup captain.Confirmation that the Ryder Cup will be postponed from September until 2021, expected last week, will arrive within 48 hours. The European Tour is expected to reveal subsequently that the rescheduled Irish Open will take the Ryder Cup’s 2020 slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8f967fe7fbc075879f6975e137346843498d4fd/0_127_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0019bd83a8b348734fa5d92ee9cff99b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

Now the British director is working on Mrs America, which stars Cate Blanchett as an infamous anti-feminist. But that’s not who’s caught Asante’s eyeIt’s difficult for Amma Asante to assess how far she’s come, because she just doesn’t have the relevant role models. “I haven’t had the example,” says the director, “of someone who is both black, British and female to look to, in terms of the career I’d like to have. It’s thwarted my sense of expectation.”Still, in the decade between making her first film, 2004’s Bafta-winning A Way of Life, and her second, the 18th-century-set drama Belle, Asante became increasingly aware of male counterparts getting more chances, being more likely to be award-nominated, and consequently getting even more opportunities and even bigger budgets.“All of that has an impact on how your career develops,” she says, “but I made a promise to myself to try to catch up – and made three films in five years. Which was exhausting.” This was the period of A United Kingdom, starring David Oyelowo as the real-life first president of Botswana, and second world war teen romance Where Hands Touch. More recently, she made the move into US television, directing episodes of The Handmaid’s Tale. And then there’s Mrs America, the miniseries about to launch on BBC Two.Mrs America stars Cate Blanchett as Phyllis Schlafly, the avowed anti-feminist who led a campaign in the 1970s to block the Equal Rights Amendment. But what might have been a straightforward biopic of Schlafly has been expanded into a wider and richer story about other women from the era, representing a broad spectrum of views and experiences.Take Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to be elected to Congress, and a candidate for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. “Her courage and vision were unparalleled,” says Asante, who seized at the chance to fully credit this lesser known figure, signing up for the episode focused on Chisholm, who is played by Uzo Aduba. “On the face of it, Chisholm failed. But without her, I don’t think there could have been an Obama. I don’t think Hillary Clinton could have thought about running.”Early episodes have a fixed camerawork style for Schlafly’s scenes, which contrast with the hand-held style used for the likes of Gloria Steinem, played by Rose Byrne. Politically, Chisholm would fit in the Steinem camp, but Asante chose not to take the looser approach. “She was at once very traditional – the way she dressed was like Thatcher – while at the same time she was pushing us to evolve. I wanted a combination of styles for her. It’s really important that, as people of colour, we can be many things at once, like any other person.”Chisholm is finally being honoured with a monument, due to be installed in Brooklyn by the end of the year. She’s just one of a huge cast of equally nuanced characters: Asante also directs the episode focusing on Betty Friedan, the mother of second wave feminism, played by Tracey Ullman. The show not only has the scope of The Wire, the period detail of Mad Men, and the power-brokering of The West Wing, it also manages to feel very relevant to the Black Lives Matter movement and progressive politics in general. Asante didn’t balk at the challenge, though, perhaps because her films – mostly period dramas exploring race, class and gender – have been such a strong preparation.Her next, The Billion Dollar Spy, tells the true story of Soviet-born CIA informant Adolf Tolkachev. This might seem a departure, she says, “in the sense that it’s two white men – not that I haven’t directed white men before”. But, actually, it’s a continuation of underlying themes: “A United Kingdom is about what happens when you love your country but you don’t love the people running it, in that case the empire. And this is about what happens when you love your country but not the people running it, and they come from the same place.”The interplay of factors that lead people to believe what they believe and do what they do is what interests Asante. It’s also what keeps drawing her to the past: “History for me is the parent of society. We don’t necessarily have to think everything they did was right, but we find ways to move forward from who they were.”She mentions the star of Belle: “Gugu Mbatha-Raw said to me the other day, ‘Really? You really don’t think you’re an activist?’ One thing I will say is I’m grateful for the work feminists have done and I’m really, really grateful for Shirley Chisholm. I’ve no doubt I’m able to stand on an American set today because she existed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ffed01a3d3595ecd30dddeb888b96084971cc5/0_46_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a6e3574893b8a722eb494df8008452","title":"china christopher wray operation fox hunt","story":"Chinese agents have been pursuing hundreds of Chinese nationals living in the US in an effort to force their return, as part of a global campaign against the country’s diaspora, known as Operation Fox Hunt, the FBI director has said.In a speech about the security threat posed by China, Christopher Wray gave the example of one Fox Hunt target who was given a choice of going back to China or killing themselves.Fox Hunt was launched six years ago by President Xi Jinping, ostensibly to pursue corrupt officials and business executives who had fled abroad. Beijing has celebrated its claimed successes, publicising the return of hundreds of economic fugitives, and issuing wanted lists of those still at large. The Obama administration complained about the activities of undercover agents in 2015.Wray said the operation’s principal aim now was to suppress dissent among the diaspora.He told the Hudson Institute in Washington: “China describes Fox Hunt as some kind of international anti-corruption campaign. It is not. Instead, Fox Hunt is a sweeping bid by Xi to target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside of China, across the world.“We’re talking about political rivals, dissidents and critics seeking to expose China’s extensive human rights violations.”The FBI director said: “Hundreds of these Fox Hunt victims that they target live right here in the United States, and many are American citizens or green card holders. The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China’s tactics to accomplish that are shocking.“For example, when it couldn’t locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target’s family here in the US. The message they said to pass on: the target had two options, returned to China promptly or commit suicide.”Wray said that Fox Hunt operations, directed by China’s ministry of public security, were also under way in other countries, and the FBI had been cooperating with its partners to foil Chinese efforts at intimidation. He said Chinese nationals in the US were often coerced by thinly veiled threats against their families back in China.Asked about other coercive tactics used, he replied: “Use your imagination. You’re not going to be far off.”He appealed to anyone in the US who thought they were a Fox Hunt target to “please reach out to your local FBI field office”.Wray portrayed China as an aggressive rival with little or no regard for international or national laws. He said that nearly half the FBI’s 5,000 active counter-intelligence cases were China-related.China was using leverage, pressure or persuasion through intermediaries on federal, state and local officials, as well as US corporations and media, to win support for Chinese foreign policy positions. Wray said such efforts had been stepped up during the coronavirus outbreak, aimed at generating praise for Beijing’s handling of the pandemic.The FBI director said that China was also involved in mass hacking, identity theft and intellectual property espionage, and there are 1,000 investigations into “China’s actual and attempted theft of technology” in all the bureau’s 56 field offices.“The people of the United States are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history,” Wray said.In an interview on Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US was considering banning the social media platform TikTok and other Chinese-made apps.India banned TikTok and over 50 other Chinese apps last week, in the wake of clashes on the China-India border in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.“We’re certainly looking at it,” Pompeo told Fox News. “With respect to Chinese apps on people’s cellphones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right. I don’t want to get out in front of the president, but it’s something we’re looking at.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bdb06e9303b745b67aa70ba26ce32d3ccaad72/0_222_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b78faa83c089dc9fcec6abf9b0b5c129","title":"new zealand politician admits leaking covid 19 private details to media hamish walker","story":"Hamish Walker says he sent list of cases to media to ‘expose government’s shortcomings’A New Zealand politician has confessed that he leaked the private details of all of the country’s active cases of Covid-19 to the media, which decided not to publish or use them.Hamish Walker, an opposition MP from the centre-right National party, said in a statement he was the source of a list of private information about the 18 active cases, which was provided to several news outlets this week.“I did this to expose the government’s shortcomings,” Walker said, adding that he had been told his actions were not illegal.A former president of the National party, Michelle Boag, then gave a statement revealing she had been the person who accessed the list of details – in her capacity as acting chief executive of a rescue helicopter trust – and passed them to Walker.“I very much regret my actions,” she said. She added that she had stepped down from her role with the trust, and said she had let down the trust – a charity – “badly”.“I very much regret my actions and did not anticipate that Hamish would choose to send it on to some media outlets,” Boag said.Earlier in the week, the government had announced an independent inquiry into the leak, which it believed was deliberate and designed to embarrass.Dr Ayesha Verrall, an infectious disease physician and Labour party candidate, called Walker’s move “totally unethical” in a tweet.“Totally unethical. This is patient information. Idea that it needed to be sent to media to make a point about privacy beggars belief,” she said.The National party’s new leader, Todd Muller, said Walker’s actions showed “an error of judgment” but did not call for his resignation – a move that critics slammed as weak.The incident has shocked New Zealanders and is being viewed as the first smear attempt of the upcoming general election. Muller and his National party colleagues have spent weeks criticising the government’s Covid-19 response as a “shambles”.Walker faced criticism last week after he said in a news release that his constituents in the South Island did not want returning New Zealanders to be quarantined in their region, referring to travellers “from India, Pakistan and Korea” in his statement.His remarks were derided by the government as racist, which he denied.New Zealand’s borders are closed for the foreseeable future, and anyone arriving in the country is required to quarantine for two weeks. Fewer than 1,500 people became infected with the disease in the Island country, and 22 people died."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7086d07a88ce7e51b4916550bf42b76c1a76eb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6819f99ae3822be666b972ceeaef00","title":"several pubs in england close after positive coronavirus tests","story":"At least four premises say they will shut after staff or customers contract virusAt least four pubs in England that reopened their doors for the first time on Saturday have been forced to close again after customers or staff tested positive for Covid-19.The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said a customer had tested positive and a list of people who were in the premises on Saturday had been contacted.In a statement posted on Facebook, it said: “This isn’t the message we wanted to write so soon, but the Lighthouse will be closed due to a customer testing positive.”Sam, the son of the pub’s landlady, who did not want to give his last name, said the Lighthouse had contacted about 100 customers before NHS Test and Trace had been in touch with management. Seven members of staff who were working on Saturday received negative results on Tuesday after being tested for the virus.The pub was closed on Monday after staff were contacted directly by a man who had tested positive for Covid-19. “We were made aware by the customer as soon as he got his test results as I know him,” said Sam.Also in Burnham, the Vape Escape bar closed on Monday for a full clean after the same man visited the shop on Saturday, while the Indian takeaway Saagar said it would be closing until Friday to undergo a deep clean after one of its drivers had been to the Lighthouse Kitchen.Leanne Underhill, the owner of the Vape Escape, said staff had been alerted by the man on Sunday morning, and had contacted all customers to advise them to get in touch with NHS Test and Trace. When she contacted NHS Test and Trace herself, she was told “following cleaning and contacting everyone that I could reopen”. Under new government advice, pubs can offer only table service, and customers must give contact details upon entry.According to UK pub and hospitality trade body guidance, contact details need only to be taken from one person in a group and must be kept for 21 days. Owners are also asked to note the arrival times of customers and how long they stay. People can refuse to give information, but owners can choose not to serve them.NHS Test and Trace will ask for these records only when it is necessary, either because someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 has listed the premises as a place they visited recently, or because the premises has been identified as a location of a potential outbreak. The guidelines do not state that it is the direct responsibility of the premise owners to contact at-risk customers themselves.If a customer or member of staff tests positive for Covid-19, others would not need to self-isolate unless contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service and advised to do so, in which case they will need to quarantine for 14 days, according to the guidelines.Somerset county council said it was not treating the cases as an “outbreak” and asked people to keep to social distancing guidelines and to regularly wash their hands.In a statement, it added: “The pub will be fully deep-cleaned, and when safe to do so we will reopen our doors. We fully understand this is a scary time, but want to ensure our customer safety is our main priority in these tough times.” The Village Home pub in Alverstoke near Gosport, Hampshire, said it had also had a case of coronavirus, adding: “Some of us are in isolation.”Its statement said: “The pub is now shut but all being well will open again on Saturday. Anyone who was in the pub over the weekend, there is no need to isolate unless you show symptoms or are contacted direct by the trace group. Thank you and hope to see you soon.”A nearby pub, the Fighting Cocks, also announced that it would close temporarily as a precaution. Tens of thousands of people flocked to pubs across England on Saturday as pubs and restaurants reopened. There were a number of arrests, but police said a majority of people had acted responsibly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48559c9631eb57c99570e18ba47cf79ef6fe06b5/21_64_1678_1007/master/1678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3683cece692f666b9a8599b2d7ac2354","title":"uk remain campaign strategist to head hong kong pr push","story":"Consulum’s Ryan Coetzee worked for Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats up to 2015 electionHong Kong has turned to the former director of strategy of the UK remain campaign in the Brexit referendum to revive its reputation, amid further scrutiny of the role played by London-based political operatives that advise overseas governments.The Hong Kong government awarded a £5m public relations contract to the Mayfair-headquartered Consulum as part of its Relaunch Hong Kong campaign, shortly before Beijing introduced a new security law designed to crush pro-democracy protests in the territory. understands the Hong Kong account is being led by Ryan Coetzee, who was employed on the unsuccessful 2016 remain campaign.Coetzee is originally from South Africa, where he helped revive the fortunes of the opposition Democratic Alliance party before moving to London during the coalition years to work for Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats. He left the party after serving as their director of strategy during the 2015 general election, in which they slumped from 57 seats to eight.Following his unsuccessful role trying to convince Britons to remain in the European Union, Coetzee joined Consulum where he continues to be heavily involved in projects to rehabilitate the overseas reputation of Saudi Arabia. These efforts were derailed in the international media by the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.One of the main aims for the Hong Kong account will be improving the city’s reputation in the international media, although this may be made more difficult amid reports that foreign reporters could be expelled from Hong Kong if they “cross the line” while reporting on pro-independence campaigns. The UK government has also angered Beijing by offering a route to British citizenship for millions of Hong Kong residents.Asked about Coetzee’s work on the Hong Kong contract, and his or his company’s work in Saudi Arabia, a spokesman for Consulum emphasised the company was focused on economic issues rather than politics. “Consulum is proud of the work that we do for our clients, developing programmes that help countries and governments improve delivery, build capacity, promote economic outcomes and manage change. We operate at the pinnacle of our industry and with the highest standards and integrity, which is the very basis upon which Consulum was founded,” he said.The Hong Kong government initially struggled to find an international PR company to take on the contract to rehabilitate its image following a tumultuous year of anti-Beijing protests in the territory, forcing it to rewrite the original tender document before awarding it to Consulum on the second attempt.Announcing the deal, the Beijing-backed administration said Consulum has been tasked with coming up with a communications strategy “to highlight Hong Kong’s recovery and help rebuild confidence in Hong Kong as a place to invest, do business, work and live”.Consulum has past experience assisting governments facing pro-democracy protests. It was founded by two ex-Bell Pottinger employees in 2012 who initially made their name working with the Bahraini government in the aftermath of the Arab spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90186333971270654efc6bb7759d88adb7a21e8/0_207_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4483476fa31a5b17c44751846b681a4e","title":"wear face masks  coverings over nose and mouth stresses no 10","story":"Criticism comes as government launches public information campaign amid low takeup Experts have urged the government to go beyond a newly announced campaign telling people in England how to wear face coverings and promote their use more forcefully, amid low takeup by the public.The information campaign will instruct people to ensure that both nose and mouth are covered in order to ensure they effective. But scientists say the government should be doing more to increase use of face coverings, which are currently mandatory only on public transport.After the president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said on Monday that refusing to wear a mask in indoor public settings should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt, other experts said the government should play its part.Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist on a subgroup of Sage and also member of Independent Sage, said on Tuesday: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that face masks are needed and warranted, particularly in indoor spaces. And I think we really need to begin thinking about how we achieve that given there’s no cultural history and there’s no huge appetite from looking around at the British public at the moment.“We need to have a really effective and nuanced campaign, and to explain why face masks are important, how they should be worn. And I think we need to do it sooner rather than later.”In Scotland, face coverings will be mandatory in shops from 10 July, whereas in England people are advised to wear them where possible in “enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet”.Unlike Boris Johnson, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has appeared in public wearing a mask. Neither the prime minister nor the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wore masks when they visited retailers to mark their reopening.However, there remain sceptics as to the benefits of face coverings. Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, said the comparison with drink-driving and not wearing a seatbelt was not a valid one.People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.“We know that drink-driving is a very dangerous thing to do and we know the reasons for that, and the same with seatbelts. We know the mitigation of harm when you have a collision and we know the reasons why that protects you from from concussion,” he said. “So that’s all clear, all the mechanics and the risk are outlined very clearly, there’s no need for further research. We know everything we should know. But this is just not the case at all for face masks.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the evidence remained mixed but, even if it was not, “mass behavioural change, such as reduction in rates of drink-driving or smoking, do not come about overnight, but from a complex package of incentives, laws, taxes, messages, stories and beliefs.” Giving details of the information campaign on how to wear masks, Johnson’s official spokesman said: “A face covering should cover both the nose and mouth to reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets, helping to protect others … It is a message we will be keen to emphasise in coming days.” Johnson has been criticised for delaying the the advice to wear face coverings, when they were already mandatory in several other countries.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

But the coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here.Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, has urged the government to abandon plans to treat coronavirus tests as a taxable benefit in kind. In a statement he said:Many employees, especially healthcare and hospitality workers, are required to undergo regular coronavirus testing. This new guidance is unclear and will worry a large number of workers.If these tests are to be treated as a taxable benefit in kind, the tax bill for workers could soon mount up.Many of our key workers could be faced with the perverse incentive of avoiding employer-sponsored tests in order to reduce their tax bill.This cannot be right. I’ve asked the chancellor to look into this as soon as possible.Since the row about Boris Johnson’s comment about care homes is still rumbling on, here are two Twitter threads which are both worth reading.From Tim Harford, presenter of BBC Radio 4’s More or LessFrom Anushka Asthana, presenter of the ’s Today in FocusThis is from Nicola Sturgeon, explaining why she did not answer a question about what would be in the SNP manifesto for next year’s Scottish parliamentary elections at her briefing today.The Labour party announced in May that it would hold its party conference this autumn online. The Conservative party has now admitted that it will do more or less the same - although it is still hoping to hold “some aspects in the physical format”. This is from Amanda Milling, the party’s co-chairman.Independent Sage, the unofficial group set up by scientists who are shadowing Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, has published a report (pdf) saying the government should be pursuing an “elimination strategy”. It says the current policy, involving the lockdown being eased gradually, will lead to “many thousands of deaths over the next nine months” because it implies an acceptable level of infection. The group, which is chaired by Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, says Boris Johnson should instead aim for a “zero Covid UK”.This is what the report says about how this might be achieved. It says the government should:Fully develop community-based and locally-led find, test, trace, isolate, support (FTTIS) programmes with expanded local laboratory provision, involvement of local public sector organisations and provision of all the resources necessary to enable adherence to the regulations on notification of infectious disease.Restrict loosening of lockdown measures in any part of the UK until control of the outbreak has been achieved in that country.Put in place well designed and scientifically based plans to act swiftly to contain and suppress completely and localise flare-ups in Covid-19 infections. Such plans to be exercised in simulation and well understood by the public before they have cause to be put into effect and implemented with full engagement with the communities affected.Restrict incoming or outgoing personal travel internationally and within Britain and Ireland to the extent necessary to maintain control of the epidemic and, in particular to ensure effective isolation of incoming passengers. Combine all these measures with a systematic public information campaign stressing that things are not ‘back to normal’ yet, that premature removal of restrictions in the midst of a deadly pandemic threatens to squander all the sacrifices of lockdown and that strict compliance with restrictions now will make a full return to normality come sooner. The public messaging must be done in a culturally acceptable manner to reach all communities especially those that have been disproportionately affected such as the deprived and ethnic minority populations. While many other countries have adopted an approach of eradication we appear to be stumbling into another disastrous policy that accepts many thousands of people could die from Covid when they need not. We consider this grossly unethical.The report argues that Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as the Republic of Ireland, have coronavirus under control and are well placed to eliminate it. But England and Wales are not in the same position, it argues.On that basis, it calls for travel between England and Scotland to be restricted.It seems sensible that travel restrictions should either be instituted on public health grounds between England (and Wales) and Ireland and Scotland, or instituted if they are not already in operation. The Republic of Ireland has already instituted requirements arriving directly from Britain.The Department of Health and Social Care has recorded a further 155 deaths in the UK in its latest daily update on coronavirus. That takes the official UK death total to 44,391.As we try to point out every day, this official headline total used by the government is not the actual total. That is because these figures only include people who tested positive for coronavirus and died. Taking into account the deaths of people who did not have a test, but where coronavirus was cited on the death certificate, the real total is more than 55,000.The Welsh health minister has expressed concern that workers at a food factory where there has been an outbreak of Covid-19 might be spreading the virus because they take it turns to use the same bed. Speaking at the Welsh government’s daily briefing, Vaughan Gething said there had been a suggestion that workers were coming off shift and jumping into a bed just vacated by a housemate who then went off to work.Gething made the remarks when he was asked about a Covid-19 outbreak associated with Rowan Foods in Wrexham, north Wales, where there have been 289 cases – an increase of six on last week. The minister said: I’m genuinely concerned about the conditions that people live within, not just in houses of multiple occupation where people may share bathroom and toilet facilities or kitchens, and the opportunity for contact indoors and surfaces is an obvious concern. You’ve heard that from our scientists, and others.But in particular, if there is reality to the suggestion that people are sharing beds, there’s an obvious risk if people finish one shift, then return from that shift to get into a bed that someone has just got out of. So there are real issues here about accommodation and how it may be an unhelpful factor in driving transmission within that workforce."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm NoonanClimate crisis and bioersity loss should be in one department \u0026ndash environment groups"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly launches the HSE’s new Covid-19 tracker app. Photograph:Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos  About 607,000 people downloaded the new Covid-19 tracker app within hours of it going live, the HSE has said. The app, developed by Waterford company Nearform, is primarily used for contact tracing, checking on symptoms daily and providing updates on Covid-19 in Ireland.Speaking at the launch of the new app, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it would enhance existing contact tracing measures. The Minister said it was not a “silver bullet” but would be a very powerful and important new tool in the fight against coronavirus. Mr Donnelly said great progress had been made by the Irish people in suppressing the virus. However, he said Covid-19 had not gone away and the situation internationally was very volatile. He said it was entirely possible there would be many more outbreaks in Ireland. The Minister urged people to download the app. “If you do, you are protecting yourself. You are protecting your family. You are protecting your friends . You are protecting many people you do not know. And if they download the app, they are protecting you and your family.”Mr Donnelly said the app’s role in testing and contact tracing would be vital to the continued momentum of the reopening of Irish society and business.“Together we have made a huge collective effort in recent months to limit the spread of Covid-19. As we ease restrictions, many important aspects of Irish life are returning, and we are able to access more services and to meet more people.“The introduction of the Covid tracker app will allow us to speed up reporting and tracing from the first onset of the symptoms of Covid-19,” he said.As of 6.30pm on Tuesday he said the app had been downloaded more than 607,000 times.‘Misleading’He said the idea that 60 per cent of a population would need to download it to make the app effective was a “bit misleading”. It was based, he said, on a UK study which said that would be the case where no other forms of contact tracing were in operation. “We are at over 600,000 already. That in and of itself is going to make a difference,” he told RTÉ Six One News of the take-up rate.“If enough of us do it, it really is going to help in terms of getting the schools back open making sure people can continue to go back to work getting the hospitals and the healthcare system back up and going.”He said when “inevitable” outbreaks occur, the app will “seriously increase our ability to react”.The Minister also said that while the app only works on relatively new smartphones, there are ample numbers of those to make it effective so long as enough people participate.On the issue of foreign travel he said the Government was asking people who have non-essential trips booked before July 20th not to go and for anyone after that date planning on going to a country not on a forthcoming “green list” of approved locations, to also cancel. ReductionMr Reid said use of the new app could see a reduction from days to hours in the time required to trace close contacts of someone who tested positive. “Importantly, it can help to identify close contacts who are not known to each other”, he said, adding every additional contact that could be traced will improve existing contact tracing operations. “By downloading the app you are helping us to reach more people in a shorter time period and to provide the right advice and access to testing. This will increase our capacity to suppress the virus.”Department of Health acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the app was integral to contact tracing. He said the new technology could lead to some people being asked to undertake more than one Covid-19 test. On Tuesday evening Dr Glynn said: “As of 5pm this evening, the Covid Tracker App had approximately 545,000 downloads. This is one more example of the solidarity and collective spirit that has characterised the Irish public’s response to Covid-19 to date.“The app is an important tool to support our contact tracing systems. It has the potential to reduce the time that people are active in the community with infection, which will have a significant impact on the transmission of the disease. “The more people who download and use this app, the more effective it will be. It is a further opportunity for us to play our part in the response to Covid-19.” The app requires the latest versions of both Apple and Google’s software, which include the exposure notification tool upon which the app is built.If you are going to use contact tracing, you will need to enable bluetooth location services are not essential, and both Apple and Google previously said there would be no sharing of location data with the Covid tracker software. Location servicesAfter installing it on both iOS and Android, neither required access to my location data, nor did they appear on the list of apps that had used location services in recent days. You will also be asked to allow the app to send you notifications.For the app to be effective as a way of tracing contacts, it requires other people to also download and use it, which is why the HSE is keen to have as many people as possible share the app.The app also asks for permission to collect app metrics, or data on how the app is being used. According to the terms and conditions, that includes if the app on your phone is being used, if exposure notification services have been turned on and if the app has received any exposure notifications. None of the permissions are essential to the working of the app, so you can refuse consent in the first instance or go back and disable them in the in-app settings.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298300.1594124234!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"healy rae suggests different rules for pubs in rural ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependent Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae believes there is a good case to be made for different rules for pubs in rural and urban parts of the country. File photograph: CollinsIndependent Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae has said that people in rural Ireland are genuinely afraid they will be made to pay for the social distancing breaches in pubs in Dublin last weekend.There was a good case to be made for different rules for pubs in rural and urban parts of the country, he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show.“If you were a small publican in a rural location who was desperately looking forward to turning on the light, maybe lighting a little fire in the corner and dusting down the cobwebs and opening the doors. They were looking forward to that and now they are afraid.“They are genuinely afraid that because of what happened in Dublin and because there was so many people out on the streets and they were nearly up on top of each other’s backs, that we are going to pay a high price for that - and we don’t want that to happen.”There would be more people going into pubs in urban areas, he said, plus there was the issue of pubs and restaurants located near each other where customers, when they came out onto the street, were “spinning over on each other.”Mr Healy-Rae said he did not want publicans in Kerry, Cork or Clare to have to pay the price for what happened in Dublin.“So, I would be pleading with the Taoiseach to act sensibly in reacting to what happened and not overreact to it. I don’t want a resurgence of this pandemic,” he said. “We don’t want more people to get sick and all we all have to do is play our part and play our role. We can’t be blaming the businesses. It is up to ourselves as iniduals to act responsibly. It is up to each one of us.

Photograph: Ronan McGreevyPubs in Dublin’s Temple Bar may not open as planned on July 20th because of fears of a repeat of the scenes at nearby Dame Lane last Saturday. Very few pubs in Temple Bar have opened since all licenced premises shut on March 15th. Temple Bar company chief executive Martin Harte said the area’s publicans were “appalled” by the scenes of hundreds of people drinking in public in a narrow allyway in Dame Lane which is close to, but not a part of Temple Bar. The short clip, which was uploaded to Twitter, showed people crowded together without observing social distancing on Saturday night. It prompted Taoiseach Micheál Martin to state that plans to allow all pubs to open from July 20th may have to be reviewed. Mr Harte estimated that only one and possibly two of Temple Bar’s 30 pubs have reopened, yet he maintained some people had sought to link the scenes in Dame Lane with Temple Bar. “To have a stupid scene like that from the first weekend is appalling. I haven’t heard from any Temple Bar publican who wasn’t appalled. They were annoyed about what happened. Dublin city does not need this,” he said. He said it may be “at least the end of July and it could take longer” before Temple Bar pubs open. Publicans had sought international advice from China which suggested that they should not reopen until they felt it was safe to do so. “People are very concerned over the changing nature of guidelines,” he said. “Six weeks ago there was a lot more consistency about the messages that were coming out from Government in terms of when you could open. “And then it got a little bit confused. I think that people are genuinely concerned that if they do open, a story is going to run like the one with Dame Lane.“Most of the publicans in Temple Bar think it has to open safely because of its brand and they don’t want what happened in Dame Lane to reverberate across social media for them. “It has happened in the past, but they don’t want it to happen in the future. They don’t want to open quickly to be closed down again. It could damage the city economy which could have serious repercussions for the future.” Mr Harte said they have studied the example of Hong Kong and how it was able to reopen following the pandemic. He said the city, which is going through tumultuous political unrest at the moment, was chosen because its dense city streets are similar to Temple Bar.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAn opposition attempt to force Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen to answer questions after his Dáil statement about his drink driving ban has been defeated.Mr Cowen will make a statement to the House later on Tuesday night on the three months driving ban imposed on him in 2016 while he held a provisional licence.Labour and a number of Independent TDs supported Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party in the 30 to 14 vote which prevented a change to the order of business.Rise TD Paul Murphy said it was not acceptable and “problematic” that Mr Cowen would give a statement without answering questions.The Dublin South-West TD said there were “numerous questions” outstanding about the offence, Mr Cowen’s licence and whether he was breaching the law repeatedly in relation to learner plates and being accompanied by a fully licensed driver.He added that it was the “first test of the Government and whether they’re going to establish a precedent” by using their majority to prevent questions to a Minster involved in controversy.Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghail said Mr Cowen had made a request for speaking time to make a personal statement under Standing Order 56 which did not allow for debate.Independent TD Mattie McGrath said no request had been made at the business committee about the issue and he accused Mr Murphy of “showboating and shenanigans”.Earlier Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected opposition suggestions that Fianna Fáil is back to “old style cute hoor kind of politics”.Labour leader Alan Kelly made the claim in the Dáil as he highlighted controversies that erupted in the party’s first week back in office.He raised the issue during Mr Martin’s first leaders’ questions in the Dáil as Taoiseach.But Mr Martin stressed that he had been focused on “policy and substance”. He said that “other stuff goes on as it always has it in politics and we will deal with that too”.Mr Kelly said that Mr Martin had had the “shortest honeymoon in history” of just two hours before internal party criticism began.He told the Taoiseach: “One of your Ministers has had to apologise quite publicly for his driving ban while on a provisional licence,” in reference to controversy over Mr Cowen and the drink driving offence in 2016.Mr Kelly added that “in the same week your Minister for health has stood over an interview where he admitted taking illegal drugs.”And “then one of your MEPs ignored the requirement for quarantine” when he returned from Brussels to attend the Dáil sitting in the Convention Centre.The Tipperary TD asked: “Are Fianna Fail public representatives above the law and above public health advice?”He said the Government’s first week had not been a good week and “the modus operandi looks like it’s back to old style cute hoor kind of politics”.He also hit out at Sinn Féin’s leadership over the controversy about breaking social distancing rules attending two funerals in the North when other families stayed home when their own relatives and friends were buried.The practice of “exceptionalism” might be expected from Sinn Féin but many thought Fianna Fail had been “humbled” by the recession.He also criticised the first act of the Minister for Education which he said “was to bellow about a new grant to a school in her own constituency”, during the biggest education crisis to face the State.The country needed a stable Government during the biggest crisis to face the State and people were concerned about housing, health, rents, mortgage arrears and returning to workMr Martin however told Mr Kelly he rejected “your analysis of the first week in Government” and said his focus has been on “policy and substance”.He said there was an unprecedented amount of legislation they would try to get through in this Government and he had had talks with senior EU officials including the president of the European Commission and British prime minister Boris Johnson.The Taoiseach said “I haven’t wasted an hour” in dealing with policy.He said “no politicians should be above the law and no politician is above the law”.Mr Martin added that punishment “was meted out” to Mr Cowen and he would address the issue in a statement later.He stressed the focus on education and not depriving children any longer of schooling and education. He said they would deal with travel and quarantines and they would focus on education and “engaging with the education authorities in terms of returning to school”, and on the return of health services."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"PM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298574.1594143631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russian space official accused of passing state secrets to west","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer journalist Ivan Safronov, detained on charges of treason for ulging state military secrets, stands inside a defendants’ cage during a court hearing in Moscow on Tuesday. Photograph: Vasily MaximovAFPRussian security services have opened a treason case against a former journalist who recently began working as an adviser to the head of the country’s space agency.Ivan Safronov was arrested on Tuesday morning by agents from the FSB, the successor agency of the KGB. He could face up to 20 years in prison.“Safronov, on the orders of the secret services of a Nato country, collected and transmitted information classified as state secrets about military co-operation, defence and security of the Russian Federation, ” said the FSB in a statement released to Russia’s Tass news agency.Mr Safronov spent nearly a decade working for the business daily Kommersant, writing mainly about the Russian military, as well as on arms deals and the space industry. He also briefly worked in the Kremlin pool of journalists who accompany President Vladimir Putin on trips.He was fired from Kommersant in May 2019 over a story about Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament. The paper’s entire political desk resigned in solidarity. He later moved to Vedomosti, one of the last remaining independent newspapers in Russia. He left after the appointment of a new acting editor-in-chief in April, which led to mass resignations from journalists who feared the new editor would bring censorship to the paper.QuestionedIn May, Mr Safronov took a job at Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, as a special adviser to the head of the organisation.There was no immediate information about the kind of secrets Mr Safronov is accused of passing on. There were suggestions the case could be related to a Kommersant article about Russia selling Su-35 fighter jets to Egypt, co-written by Mr Safronov. It was published in March last year and deleted from the website shortly afterwards.Russian media reported that Mr Safronov had been questioned by the FSB on numerous occasions, including in relation to the story.Mr Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the case was not related to Mr Safronov’s work as a journalist, while Roscosmos released a statement saying it was not related to his work there. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roskosmos, said Mr Safronov had no access to state secrets in his work at the agency.Over the past few years there has been a spate of treason cases brought in Russia, often against elderly scientists who say they were carrying out routine scientific work in collaboration with western colleagues. Treason trials are usually held in partial secrecy.ArrestThe lawyer Sergei Badamshin, who has acted for defendants in a number of treason cases, said on Tuesday afternoon that the FSB was not allowing a lawyer to meet Mr Safronov, claiming they had no information about his whereabouts despite having put out a video of the arrest.“It’s often a sign that there are problems with the case that could be identified by a lawyer. When they are confident, there’s no problem with the lawyers being present,” said Mr Badamshin.Mr Safronov’s father, also called Ivan and also a Kommersant journalist, died in 2007 after falling from a window at the family home. He had been working on a story about military contracts with Iran and Syria before his death, according to colleagues. His colleagues suspected foul play at the time. The story was never published.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Speculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Not wearing them outside the home should be considered as anti-social as drink-driving, or failing to wear a seat belt, he said.It comes as two new reports on face coverings were published by the organisation, including one which found the UK was slower to take up wearing them compared with other countries.Prof Ramakrishnan said: The virus has not been eliminated, so, as we lift lockdown and people increasingly interact with each other, we need to use every tool we have to reduce the risk of a second wave of infection.There are no silver bullets, but alongside hand washing and physical distancing, we also need everyone to start wearing face coverings, particularly indoors in enclosed public spaces where physical distancing is often not possible.Prof Ramakrishnan said the UK is way behind other countries in wearing face coverings, as he claimed that messaging has been unclear and that inconsistent guidance has led to people following their own preferences.Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public, he said.  Elsewhere the mandatory wearing of masks has become a polarising issue, especially in the United States.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has previously said the evidence does not currently support the use of masks to protect the wearer in the general population.But the group said that if someone is infectious with Covid-19 symptoms, face coverings will reduce transmission.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has concluded that the use of a medical mask could prevent the spread of droplets from an infected person.The body said, however, that there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including Covid-19.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia bans marmot hunting reports bubonic plague china mongolia","story":"Russia has increased efforts to prevent the public from hunting marmots after reports of cases of bubonic plague in neighbouring China and Mongolia.Two cases in Mongolia last week were linked to people in the western province of Khovd eating marmot meat. Then, on Sunday, a warning was issued by authorities in the Chinese city of Bayan Nur, located in the Inner Mongolia region, after a local hospital reported a suspected case.The region has now explicitly forbade the hunting and eating of all large rodents and told the public to report any sick or dead marmots they find, as well as suspected cases of the plague. These plague-prevention mechanisms will be enforced for the rest of the year.In Russia’s Altai region, which borders China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan, authorities have been dispatched to patrol the area to ensure the ban is enforced, TASS news agency reported. The local consumer health watchdog has said they “are curbing illegal hunting on marmots and conducting an awareness campaign with breeders about the strict rules”.WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said the organisation was aware of the outbreak and monitoring it but, at the moment we are not...considering it high-risk.”The Russian-Mongolian border has been closed to all but essential goods since mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak. Temperature checks are conducted on all truck drivers by Russian border agents.Marmots are a native cuisine of Mongolia and Siberia, and have been eaten by local people for centuries. Barbecued marmot, known as boodog, is a delicacy in Mongolia. Russia in 2014 outlawed marmot hunting which is still popular with indigenous people in the Altai region close to the Chinese border. Several cases of bubonic plague were reported there in 2014 through 2016, all connected to marmot meat, and plague vaccination in the region has since been expanded.In May 2019, a Mongolian couple died after contracting bubonic plague by eating raw marmot kidney in the most westerly region of Mongolia. The region was placed under quarantine for six days at the time.Also known as the Black Death in the Middle Ages, the bubonic plague is a highly infectious, often lethal disease spread primarily by fleas and rodents. It causes a high fever, chills and large areas of swelling on the skin, known as buboes. According to the World Health Organisation, if left untreated, 30-60 per cent of those who contract the disease die.In the mid-1300s, an outbreak of bubonic plague in Europe killed one-third of the entire population of the continent. Modern research suggests that outbreak was also linked to the steppes of inner Mongolia. However, modern, widely-available antibiotics are able to cure the disease with relative ease.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"workers told hmrc pay office based coronavirus tests paye","story":"Workers will have to pay for coronavirus tests organised by their employers through their annual tax returns, HM Revenue and Customs has ruled.HMRC guidance published this week makes it clear that employees will face a taxable benefit in kind for private tests carried out in the workplace.The decision means that an employee could see their take-home pay cut by more than £3,000 per year if they have to be regularly tested, according to calculations seen by The .The decision has raised fears that people will be put off from testing to avoid being left out of pocket. MPs said treating a coronavirus test as a workplace benefit was a joke.The guidance says: Coronavirus testing kits or tests carried out by a third party which have been purchased by you to provide to your employees, are treated as a taxable benefit in kind on the employee.The Government\u0027s workplace safety guidance does not include temperature checking or medical testing in the list of steps employers should necessarily be taking.However, many employers are actively considering these extra precautions. Benefits in kind cover anything not included in salary which is received by staff from their employers.In this instance, a cash value will be assigned to the coronavirus test by the employer, and the employee will pay Income Tax on this amount through Pay As You Earn (PAYE).Mel Stride, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, said: “Many of our key workers could be faced with the perverse incentive of avoiding employer-sponsored tests in order to reduce their tax bill.“This cannot be right. I’ve asked the Chancellor to look into this as soon as possible.”He added: Many employees, especially healthcare and hospitality workers, are required to undergo regular coronavirus testing. This new guidance is unclear and will worry a large number of workers.“If these tests are to be treated as a taxable benefit in kind, the tax bill for workers could soon mount up.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat leadership contender, added: We cannot have a system where you pay tax as you test.The government cannot class a vital health test as a \u0027benefit\u0027, the idea that this is a perk for an employer or employee is a joke.NHS workers and anyone else who has their test provided by the Government via the national testing programme will not be subject to the tax. People who fill out a self-assessment tax return will have to declare the cost of any tests on it. Some frontline workers are now being tested as often as once a week, and at-home coronavirus tests can easily cost £150 or more. That means privately testing one employee every week for a year could cost £7,800.A higher-rate taxpayer earning £60,000 would pay income tax of 40pc on this, equal to a total of £3,120 over the year, according to calculations by wealth manager Quilter.Someone making £30,000 a year, paying the lower rate of income tax, would face a 20pc charge (£1,560). Quilter’s Rachael Griffin said: “It’s unclear whether this was a snap decision made without thinking through the consequences or a money-making ploy.Tim Stovold of accountancy firm Moore Kingston Smith added: “It is absurd that HMRC should collect tax on employer provided kits.

The new figures suggest there is a potentially large number of asymptomatic cases – meaning the virus could be spread by people who don’t realise they are carrying it. Only 33 per cent of those testing positive for Covid-19 reported any evidence of symptoms at the time of their swab test or at either the preceding or subsequent swab test, ONS analysis shows. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis falls to 22 per cent when accounting for those who reported evidence of symptoms only at the time of their swab test. The ONS analysis is based on a small sample of 115 iniduals from private residential households in England who tested positive for Covid-19 and does not include hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.

Infection rates are higher for those working in patient-facing healthcare or resident-facing social care roles than for people not working in these roles, the data suggests. There is also some evidence to suggest infection rates are lower in one- and two-person households than in larger households. Antibody test result data also indicates white people are less likely to have had Covid-19 in the past than non-white ethnic groups.

The number of deaths registered in both countries in the week ending 26 June was 8,979 – down 360 from the previous week, ONS said. Boris Johnson has been condemned for appearing to suggest that care home bosses were to blame for the large number of deaths in those settings. “We discovered too many care homes didn’t really follow the procedures in the way they could have,” the prime minister claimed on Monday as he addressed concerns raised by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens. The National Care Association said the remarks were a “huge slap in the face” to those working in the sector, with the National Care Forum branding the comments “hugely insulting”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A pocket-sized, insect-eating reptile that lived 237 million years ago was an ancestor of giant dinosaurs that went on to dominate the world, newly studied fossils suggest.Kongonaphon kely, whose scientific name means “tiny bug slayer,” stood at just 10cm (4ins) tall and 40cm (16ins) long. It inhabited a floodplain region of what is now southwestern Madagascar during the Triassic period, according to scientists who unveiled the species this week.A long-legged and possibly bipedal predator, the Kongonaphon was a member of a group called Ornithodira, which evolved into dinosaurs and their flying cousins pterosaurs. The origins of the later, larger reptiles are poorly known as few specimens from near the root of this lineage have been found.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut American and Madagascan researchers who described the new species in a study on Monday said their analysis suggested dinosaurs and pterosaurs “evolved from a miniaturised ancestor” that lived relatively recently before them.“There’s a general perception of dinosaurs as being giants,” said Christian Kammerer, a research curator in palaeontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. “But this new animal is very close to the ergence of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and it’s shockingly small.”Asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs hit at ‘deadliest possible angle’Dinosaurs and pterosaurs first appeared roughly 230 million years ago. The early dinosaur Herrerasaurus was about 6m (20ft) long, while the early pterosaur Eudimorphodon was pigeon-sized.Both groups eventually achieved gigantic proportions. The pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus had a wing of about 10.5m (35ft), akin to an F-16 fighter. The dinosaur Argentinosaurus reached about 35m(115ft) long.In the context of this later gigantism, an animal like Kongonaphon “that could fit into your hands seems almost paradoxical,” said Dr Kammerer, the study’s lead author. He suggested “some of these things would have been quite cute animals” that “would probably make a great pet”.“However, it fits the broader pattern that we observe at this time. There was a sustained trend towards smaller adult body sizes in the early history of this lineage,” he added.“This is based not only on Kongonaphon, but on a series of small-bodied reptiles near the common ancestry of the dinosaur and pterosaur lineages.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe fossils of Kongonaphon were discovered in 1998 in Madagascar by a team of researchers led by John Flynn, curator of fossil mammals at the American Museum of Natural History.Dr Flynn said: “This fossil site in southwestern Madagascar from a poorly known time interval globally has produced some amazing fossils, and this tiny specimen was jumbled in among the hundreds we’ve collected from the site over the years.“It took some time before we could focus on these bones, but once we did, it was clear we had something unique and worth a closer look.”Researchers said the shape of Kongonaphon’s small, conical and unserrated teeth and an examination of microscopic wear on them suggest it ate insects or other small invertebrates. Analysis of a cross section of fossilised bone indicate the specimen found was likely a mature animal.Kongonaphon is not the first small species known near the root of the ornithodiran family tree, but previously such specimens were considered “isolated exceptions to the rule,” Dr Kammerer noted. In general, the scientific belief was that body size remained similar among the first archosaurs – the larger reptile group that includes birds, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs – before increasing to gigantic proportions among dinosaurs.Dr Kammerer said: “Recent discoveries like Kongonaphon have given us a much better understanding of the early evolution of ornithodirans. Analysing changes in body size throughout archosaur evolution, we found compelling evidence that it decreased sharply early in the history of the dinosaur-pterosaur lineage.”The findings could help to answer questions about how and why dinosaurs evolved as they did. For instance, the researchers believe the fuzzy skin coverings and feathers found on both dinosaurs and pterosaurs may have originated in their miniature common ancestor, which would have required extra help to keep its small body warm in the mid-late Triassic era of climatic extremes.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises.“No pubs have been closed by the police.“We’d like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.”Elsewhere, police in Essex claim to have made four arrests following a “disturbance” in Brentwood High Street.Special inspector Steve Weaver tweeted: “That didn’t last long. Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent\u0027s Help the Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material — meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website — they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That\u0027s the key question which we don\u0027t know the answer to. Brexit talks end a day early as \u0027significant differences\u0027 remainEU must prepare for no-deal Brexit, Merkel warnsDr Jablonowski said the biggest problem with gauging whether the scheme was working was that we do not know how many EU citizens are here.I\u0027m looking at the impact assessment for the EU settlement scheme produced by the Home Office in 2019, and that states that it\u0027s anything between 3.5 and 4.1 million, he told MPs.So even the Home Office admits that there is an uncertainty around 600,000 people and since that was published we\u0027ve learned that there are further problems with the reliability of the population statistics that these numbers are based on. The numbers are complicated by the fact that there is constant churn of EU citizens leaving and entering the UK, including during the period the scheme is open, and that not everybody who registers intends to stay.There is also concern that vulnerable groups could not understand that they have to register.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don\u0027t have a clear picture of those that can and should apply. I think it\u0027s more likely in my experience that older people are more likely to have an assumption that they have a right to be here than say anybody else.But I would say that there is a very concerning trend - and this steps beyond the vulnerable categories into more general EU citizen population - that there is worrying perception from some people that they don\u0027t need to do anything. I regularly come across people who have previously applied for an acquired permanent residence document, thinking that that\u0027s the end of the journey, they don\u0027t need to do anything else or that they\u0027ve been told by somebody that they\u0027re British and they don\u0027t ned to worry about it or that they have this perception that they\u0027ve lived here all their life and they don\u0027t need to do anything. There are very similar trends here in the assumption of rights to those who were impacted by the Windrush scandal. There was this continuing assumption that they were OK and when they faced those barriers to employment, housing, health, it was only at that stage then that they realised that they weren\u0027t safe and unfortunately sometimes it\u0027s too late then, and it could take time for them to retrospectively fix the damage that has been done.During the Windrush scandal, new restrictions imposed by the government on needing legal documentation to work and get housing or healthcare meant many people were wrongly deported, threatened with deportation, or denied rights because they could not produce the correct documentation. Many of those affected had arrived legally in in the UK before 1973 as British subjects.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Tengger tribe people make their way to the summit of Mount Bromo volcano to make offerings in Probolinggo, as part of the Yadnya Kasada Festival.

They can still apply to use this immigration instrument.So on top of EU nationals who actually live in the UK we have significant numbers of EU nationals already departed form the UK who might want to retain their connections to the country because of children or whatever, or they just want to come back - so that\u0027s additional thousands of people we might need to consider as clients for this particular scheme.Asked by MPs why they had not been contacted by many constituents asking for help with the scheme, she said: Our experience is that eastern Europeans in general are much less willing to see out hope from broader society, they more rely on their own networks. That is partially because people feel they are not equals, that they will be seen as EU residents, therefore they will not have tried to speak to their local MP for example - because they don\u0027t see their local MP as representing them. They are told that they are immigrants and they are being told that they come here to do bad times, stealing jobs. Frankly it is very disturbing but quite a high level of EU nationals harbour this feeling, quite frankly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The announcement from the international trade secretary comes just a day after the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would introduce a sanctions regime that will target people who have committed the gravest human rights violations and that Global Britain will be an even stronger force for good in the world, in the years ahead.In March 2015 a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen against Houthi rebels, who are fighting the internationally recognised government and control large swathes of territory. But humanitarian groups and the UN quickly accused Saudi-led forces of breaching international humanitarian law, including bombing schools, hospitals, weddings and food infrastructure.The conflict has cost an estimated 100,000 lives, with 80 per cent of Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has said “the crisis is of cataclysmic proportions”.In June 2019, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Government had acted unlawfully by licencing the sale of UK-made arms to Saudi forces for use in Yemen without assessing whether incidents in the conflict had amounted to breaches of international humanitarian law.Since the bombing of Yemen started in March 2015 the UK government has issued export licences worth £5.3 billion, including £2.5 billion of licences relating to bombs, missiles and other types of ordinance.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailIn a notice to exporters published on Tuesday, the government added: The broader commitment that was given to parliament, relating to licences for Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners ... no longer applies. The government will now begin the process of clearing the backlog of licence applications for Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners that has built up since 20 June last year.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade described the government\u0027s move as disgraceful and morally bankrupt and said that it exposed the rank hypocrisy at the heart of UK foreign policy.The Saudi-led bombardment of Yemen has created the world\u0027s worst humanitarian crisis, and the government itself admits that UK-made have played a central role on the bombing. We will be considering this new decision with our lawyers, and will be exploring all options available to challenge it, he said.The evidence shows a clear pattern of heinous and appalling breaches of International humanitarian law by a coalition which has repeatedly targeted civilian gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and market places. The government claims that these are isolated incidents, but how many hundreds of isolated incidents would it take for the Government to stop supplying the weaponry?This exposes the rank hypocrisy at the heart of UK foreign policy. Only yesterday the government was talking about the need to sanction human rights abusers, but now it has shown that it will do everything it can to continue arming and supporting one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world.Rosa Curling of Leigh Day solicitors, which took the original case to court, said the decision was being looked at carefully.Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said: “This is a deeply cynical move to restart business as usual when it comes to Saudi arms sales.“How the Government can seriously describe a five-year Saudi-led aerial assault on Yemen which has seen numerous examples of civilians killed in schools, hospitals, funeral halls and market places as a set of ‘isolated incidents’ is almost beyond comprehension.“This seems like an attempt to rewrite history and disregard international law. The UK is bypassing its obligations under the international arms control framework. Its approach to this decision has effectively rendered our own protections meaningless.Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam, described the decision as nothing short of cruel.“It’s shocking that less than a week after signing up to a UN Security Council resolution for a global ceasefire, the UK government is announcing a resumption of weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. The UK should not licence arms to a country that has led a coalition in their bombardment of Yemen over more than five years, he said.“Even before the coronavirus hit, Yemen was already facing the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis and had seen its hospitals and clinics decimated in the conflict. It’s nothing short of cruel that the government should take the decision to restart sales to Saudi Arabia at such a time.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Tengger tribe people make their way to the summit of Mount Bromo volcano to make offerings in Probolinggo, as part of the Yadnya Kasada Festival.

This shows that the work of that committee, and the scrutiny that comes with it, is more important than ever.A government spokesperson said: “The Government has retaken the licensing decisions as required by the Court of Appeal. All existing and new applications for Saudi Arabia for possible use in the conflict in Yemen will be assessed against the revised methodology which considers whether there is a clear risk the equipment might be used in the commission of a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.“The Government takes its export responsibilities seriously and assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria. We will not issue any export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sub-Saharan Africa is behind and I think we\u0027re just at the start of their outbreak, we think in that continent.Many African countries are moving to open their airspace to encourage tourism in a bid to stave off further economic damage, even as cases climb.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Tengger tribe people make their way to the summit of Mount Bromo volcano to make offerings in Probolinggo, as part of the Yadnya Kasada Festival.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We can only regret such unfriendly steps. Of course, the principle of reciprocity and some kind of retaliatory response will apply to the extent that it suits the interests of the Russian Federation,” Mr Peskov said. Speaking about the new sanctions regime, Mr Raab told parliament on Monday: “If you’re a kleptocrat or an organised criminal, you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country.”UK to impose sanctions on iniduals for alleged human rights abuses“Today this government ... sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs and despots, the henchmen and dictators, will not be free to waltz into this country to buy up property on the King’s Road, to do their Christmas shopping in Knightsbridge, or frankly to siphon dirty money through British banks or other financial institutions,” the foreign minister added. Following his announcement in the House of Commons, Mr Raab met with the widow and son of Sergei Magnitsky, who died after 11 months of mistreatment in Russian police custody in 2009 after he raised allegations that Russian officials had been involved in massive tax fraud. Magnitsky’s friend and colleague Bill Browder, who has led the campaign for justice over his death, also attended the meeting. Alexander Bastrykin, an investigator who reports directly to President Vladimir Putin, and Aleksey Anichin, a former deputy interior minister, are among the Russians who the UK has now blacklisted over Magnitsky’s death. The UK also sanctioned 20 Saudis for their roles in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018, including intelligence and security officials in the office of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In a statement given before Mr Raab’s announcement, the Foreign Office said that the measures mark the first UK-only sanction regime, rather than sanctions introduced by Britain as part of a EU or United Nations regime.  Commenting on the UK sanctions on Monday, Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said: “We strongly support efforts to bring more human rights abusers to justice, but there’s a risk with a unilateral approach that sanctions could be selectively imposed by the UK for what are essentially political reasons.“It is far preferable to have a joined-up, multilateral approach, working through the UN or the EU for example,” she added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I would favour a stronger north-south relationship and the development of that.#He added: #The agenda for the future of this island is how we engineer and develop an accommodation where we can all live in peace and harmony on the island and to not try to dictate to one tradition about what the solution is going to be which seems to be the agenda youre pursuing.#The Good Friday Agreement is the defining document because it is based on three sets of relationships, the British-Irish relationship, the north-south relationship and the two traditions within Northern Ireland itself.#The pound rose to a three-week high today, strengthening almost one percent against the euro.It surged on optimism that British and EU trade negotiators could find common ground at a dinner planned for later in the day.Kenneth Broux, an analyst at Societe Generale, said: #I think there is a little bit of optimism today for the dinner that is taking place tonight at  Downing Street.#The market is looking at what is going to give a boost in the next six months# but I think its mostly flow driven and volumes that are not really heavy.#The word ‘“gammon” is back in the news after a row erupted on a BBC podcast where white women were told not to become “Karens”.“Gammon” is used as an insult to describe middle-aged white men, commonly those who supported Brexit and are politically right wing.Interviewees on the latest episode of No Country for Young Women told white women that they needed to #read some books# and #get out of the way,” sparking a furious backlash.Tory MP Ben Bradley tweeted: “BBC spending £m on ersity and this junkwhilst at the same time ditching regional news in order to save £m.“Absolute joke. Cancelling my TV license. I dont need to pay for this.”TalkRADIO presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer commented: “So I’m a gammon, a boomer and now I’m a Karen too.“Another day, another insult.

It’s expected one subject the pair will address is fishing # a major sticking point in trade talks. Barnier has already backed down on the UK leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, and opting instead for zonal attachment.

He said a #basic# FTA eliminating tarfs and quotas is doable but getting anything more substantial by the end of the year is #totally unrealistic#.Mr Coveney said: #Very, very little progress has been made. I would be naive to say a no trade deal isnt possible.#But it would be such an act of self-harm and such a failure of politics, I believe politicians and governments will find a way of getting a deal.# Britain imposed sanctions on  Russians and  Saudis on Monday as part of post-Brexit measures were aimed at stopping the laundering of #blood money#.After leaving the European Union in January, Boris Johnson said he wanted a new independent role for Britain in foreign and trade affairs.This is the first time the country could impose asset freezes and visa bans independently.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has pressed for tough sanctions and set out the first names in parliament.#If youre a kleptocrat or an organised criminal, you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country,# Raab told MPs.They include Russian nationals Britain says were involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and Saudis held to be involved in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Russia said it would respond to the new measures while the Saudi government media office and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier will travel to London on today for talks with his UK counterpart David Frost.Last week, discussions between the two sides on a post-Brexit trade deal broke up early with #signicant dferences# remaining.But Mr Barnier and Mr Frost will meet face-to-face in London, before talks with the rest of their teams on Wednesday.The UKs chief negotiator Mr Frost said last week that though the ability to meet in person had given #extra depth and flexibility# to the discussions, there was more to do.Mr Barnier said that while Brussels had engaged #constructively#, officials needed to see an #equivalent engagement from the UK side#.#Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,# he said. #However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain.#It had been hoped the face-to-face meetings # agreed following a high-level conference call last month between Boris Johnson and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen # would inject new momentum into the process.Many unionists may hand the SNP its biggest mandate for independence after seeing the benefits of the devolution during the pandemic.Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that the Covid- pandemic had demonstrated the power the Scottish government has to chart a dferent course from Westminster.Professor Curtice said this could hand the SNP a bigger share of the vote, The Times reports.On BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, he said: “The fact that Scotland has its own government, and that Scotland can do absolutely crucial things for everybody’s lives, has been more apparent in the last three months than it has been in the previous  years of devolution.Michel Barnier has said the negotiations in coming weeks will be #decisive# for the EU and UK to secure a free-trade deal.He urged Boris Johnson to drop his “unacceptable approach” to the talks when they meet to discuss the negotiations.In evidence published by the House of Lords yesterday, Mr Barnier said: #If there is to be further progress on the substance it has to come from the UK.#The coming weeks will be decisive in setting the direction of this agreement.#We are working for a deal, but we do not need to speed things up. We are ready for the hypothesis of no deal.#He added: “We are open to being creative so that we keep ious sides happy.”A Finnish MEP has claimed Brexit could be the #beginning of the end# for the European Union.Laura Huhtasaari claimed Brussels is aware the EU would be more prosperous outside of the union.She also suggested the EU is trying to make it #more dficult# to leave like the UK.The politician told the Express: #Weber, who leads the European People’s Party, said thatthe UK’s exit was to be successful and you would prosper and triumph…the EU is afraid of competition.#It knows that the member states would do better without the federal state, they would do better as independent states in a free trade area.#If Brexit is a success, it will be the beginning of the end of the EU.#The EU is willing to accept UK requests that fishing opportunities be ided using a scientic method after Brexit, Thereports. The method will reflect the number of fish in UK waters rather than use the EUs Common Fisheries Policy. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has hinted that Brussels could agree to the use of zonal attachment, an important British request in ongoing trade negotiations.He said: “There will be no trade agreement with the UKthere is no balanced agreement on fisheries.”British fishing organisations believe that the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means that they have not received their fair share of quotas – rights to catch a certain amount of fish – in UK waters.This has, they believe, contributed to the decline of the fishing industry and fishing communities over the last  years.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected Chinas accusation that Britain had indulged in #gross interference# over Beijings imposition of new security legislation in Hong Kong.He told Reuters: #This isnt a gross interference in domestic affairs.#Its a matter of trust and lots of countries around the world are asking this question: does China live up to its international obligations # Earlier on Monday, Chinas ambassador to London said the remarks made by Britain could damage future Chinese investment.Ambassador Liu Xiaoming has warned the UK not to interfere with Hong Kong following the imposition by Beijing of a sweeping new national security law.It comes after the UK offered a path to citizenship for up to three million people from Hong Kong.The Chinese ambassador said this was #gross interference# from the UK.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected the accusation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly. Many of the NHS staff tell us they were just doing their jobs and that was their purpose in le.For the nurses and doctors, looking after people is a calling.This is our chance to show how grateful we are that they followed that calling and stay true to it — even when their lives are in danger.Of course, this is not a celebration, because people are still passing away and carers are still being put in danger.Tonight we would like people to put some kind of light in their window, an electric one rather than a candle, and to pause for reflection.Many landmarks will also be lit up in blue as we remember the thousands who have lost their lives.The other reason why this weekend is a good time to come together again is that there have been signs of a ide in the nation. We also need to remember that we are not over coronavirus  yet.We don’t know what is going to happen and there is a risk that there will be a second spike.We have already seen in Leicester that a fresh lockdown was needed and people are still dying.News is changing so fast and there is so much uncertainty.The Together coalition, which I am part of, hopes we can bring back that special spirit that helped us get through the worst of the crisis.We hope that Sunday can be a positive spark.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m angry, upset.“I just want people to know the way they [Wizz Air] operate, their lack of compassion. Their communication is zero.I feel sorry for the people working there because they have obviously not been trained very well. It was utter chaos.He added: Myself and James are on an emotional rollercoaster at the moment.James, ,  said: “I managed to make it on. No thanks to Wizz Air who were trying to kick me off the plane.“I kind of tricked them into thinking my passport was Portuguese, which is why I didn’t get thrown off the plane. “I can’t imagine what my uncle feels like at this moment not getting to see his brother. I’d be absolutely livid. “I saw my dad at the hospital. He was unconscious but he was still alive. The soonest my uncle could get after that was a flight with BA the following morning.“Shortly after he arrived at the airport my dad passed away a couple of minutes later. So he didn’t get to see him.He added: “The damage is done there’s no coming back from what they [Wizz Air] have done there.”To add to the family’s torment, a two-hour delay in kicking furious passengers off the Wizz Air flight meant James had to sleep in their hire car after landing in Portugal as the hotel was closed for the night.Staff on board the low cost carriers flight said they had been told there had been a change in the rules which meant those without a Portuguese passport or visa would not be allowed in. Passengers said they contacted Lisbon Airport and staff there said there is no such rule in place.Official sources told The Sun Wizz Air made a mistake in human error by kicking the passengers off.Police were even called to escort passengers who refused to leave the flight back to the airport terminal on Saturday evening. Clive said: “We got to the gate and my nephew was let through. I was told to stand aside.“There were already a few people there. We were told to wait, there was no explanation then it became clear we weren’t going to fly.“People were getting really agitated. It was an awful situation. It all kicked off.“The only reason they let my nephew through is because he’s got an Italian passport.“We were corralled into this corner by check in. The Wizz Air staff were absolutely appalling.James said: I was able to get on the plane then they tried to kick us off because they were sayingyou didn’t have Portuguese passport and Portuguese residency, you need to get off.“They went through a couple of hours later and checked everybody’s passport. I didn’t show them the cover of my passport. I just flashed the photo page.“It was really lucky I got through. This is a complete cock-up by Wizz. There were no restrictions. I went straight through immigration in Portugal with absolutely no problems.“What they were saying was we’ll be turned away and they can’t allow us on the plane. Absolute rubbish.Other passengers raged at the airlines mistake.Data engineer Joseph Honeywood, , was jetting out from Luton to Lisbon to work for a month when he was ordered off. Joseph, from Erith, South East London, spent £ on his flights.He said: “There were about  of us who had to get off. Its so frustrating. I was really looking forward to going out there for a few weeks to enjoy the sunshine and get away.At one point Wizz Air staff said people could go on the flight but when we got there we could not enter the country. It was a joke.Another passenger said: Wizz Air staff used fear tactics to get people off. We couldnt believe it. Then they even called the police for people who would not leave.Rules at the time said people are free to travel to the country but must self-isolate for  days upon . A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: We attended in a supporting capacity and no offences occurred. A spokesman for Wizz Air said at the time: Wizz Air sincerely apologises to customers on board the Luton to Lisbon service yesterday evening, who were wrongfully informed that British nationals are not eligible to enter Portugal. This was a result of a genuine mistake by the airline. All affected passengers are being rebooked onto other Wizz Air flights to Lisbon, and are being contacted inidually in order to apologise directly.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With other sports there may be issues.“It’s not a question of how do we make it better, it just has to stop across the board.These healthy conversations will help make a change because people will learn more about this and will educate their kids.“I want to use my position as a sportsman with a big  to put back into the community and unite and change the image.I don’t want us to only be relevant when I’m knocking someone out or a police off­icer has his knee on someone’s neck.“I want us to have positive images that there are architects, doctors, entrepreneurs, lawyers and valuable members of British society amongst the afro carribean community.”Patrick: “It is probably about the same. The only dference is, now it is unacceptable whereas before it was acceptable.I’ve heard fans giving racial abuse to players on the pitch and clubs get a few thousand pounds fine. Where are the £million fines  That would send a real message.”Trevor: “As a teenager and student I stopped going to see my club, Cha, in the early Seventies. They used to throw darts, and I realised I had become the bullseye in the Shed end. That’s not going to happen now.“But we need to think about how could it be that in football, where around  per cent of players are people of colour, of the  managers in the top flight just one is black.“So the answer is not that there is more racism in the game — I think things are much better than they were, but the game itself now has to say, ‘Are the black guys in the game for everybody’s entertainment or do they become leaders too ’ ”Hugh: “Just three of  board ­members – board positions on national sport ­governing bodies – were held by ­people who were non-white. Do you see any barriers  Andthere are any, what can alleviate them ”Anthony: “I think it is important to take your destiny in your own hands and that will lead me to my career after boxing where I’m in control.“I want to be financially literate, understand accounts, legals, business conduct. All these aspects will help put me in a managerial position.“I’ve had these conversations with my management team, with my partners and sponsors. Even as a black man myself I know how many people I hire from one community to an­other. I have been making changes.”Trevor: “I love what Anthony just said. Nobody is going to be able to put on a big boxing event without Anthony Joshua. So he says, ‘By the way, when you put this event on I want to see ersity.’And that is fantastic, because black sportspersons did not do that in the past. Possibly the only one that would have done that would have been Muhammad Ali.“So a generation of sportspeople like Anthony are now using their powers to change things more widely.”Katharine: “It is not just a problem in sport because in the top  FTSE companies there is no black CEO. Over half of them don’t have a black board member. We do need to win hearts and minds.”Stuart: “Look at the top — the FA board members, the ersity, the age range, the amount of men there. Unless we are changing the way the top looks, we are always going to have these conversations.”Hugh: “We have seen TV presenters wear Black Lives Matter badges, we saw the words on the back of the shirts in the Premier League. And we have seen broadcasters taking badges off. Do you think Black Lives Matter just as a statement has ­suddenly become too isive ”Katharine: “People want to show themselves to not be racist, so they wear something and say, ‘look at me, I am not a racist’.I want to say to them, ‘Why don’t you volunteer in a charity  Come and work in the inner city with young black people ’  I don’t want the stuff that signals — I want the stuff that does something.”ROHAN Aden, , of Harrow: “What does Black Lives Matter mean to you ”Anthony: “I believe that the mass ­gatherings are so important because it spreads awareness. I stand for what the Black Lives Matter slogan means.“There are architects, doctors, ­entrepreneurs, lawyers and valuable members of British society among the Afro-Caribbean community. I believe it will move to a better place.“I’m still really connected to my grass roots. So I went back to the community in Watford and am working on a project.“I want to help the local kids from every background with opportunities.”Stuart: “This fight is my fight – it is not my son’s fight. I want to make sure in the rest of the time I have here I am dedicating myself to this, to seeing real change.“I know it is not going to happen overnight. I want to make sure when my son is my age this conversation isn’t a thing.”Trevor: “We should not get into the mindframe of thinking thateverything we always wanted to happen doesn’t happen in the next three months, then it has all been pointless.The big step ­forward recently is that people are no longer embarrassed to talk about race.”Katharine: “I think these last few weeks have given us the opportunity to do exactly what we are doing here, which is talk about the issue.“I think it is important not to alienate people because we all want to live in a society together where we can get on.” KIRSTY Wright, , of Kent: “Do you have faith in the British policing ­sys­tem or do you think prejudice still exists ”Stuart: “It took one good copper to do something that made a massive impact into my brother’s case and I am always mindful of that.They have moved forward but there is always going to be that institutional racism in the Met while people do the same sort of things and the same sort of training and the same people who are in there.”Patrick: “The reasons my friends and I went down to the Black Lives Matter protests was because of our lack of trust in the national policing system.“We thought we needed to oversee young children to stop them getting into any trouble. Black people get a raw deal when it comes to policing.”Trevor: “There is still a major issue for some police forces but anybody who says there has not been any change isn’t looking at what is happening and would be massively disrespecting both the work that Stuart and the Lawrence family did and its impact, which has been profound in this country.”Anthony: “This is a topic I don’t know the solution to because when you are put in a position of power it just depends how you use it. I think young people start out thinkingthey are in trouble they call the police.But then they see the video of a police officer with his knee on George Floyd’s neck and it can become a massive distrust.”JULIE Howe, of Kent: “How can we change the National Curriculum to give our children a better education on black history and race issues ”Katharine: “Education is complex and the reason children don’t know lots of things is more to do with the poor behaviour in schools and poor teaching methods.I have never seen a history textbook that doesn’t teach slavery, civil rights in America, colonialism.”Stuart: “I was a school teacher for  years. And to be honest, what you focus on a lot is how to get kids through their GCSEs. I would like to see kids have more choice to pick the history topics.”Patrick: “When I was at school I learned about the Tudors, Henry VIII Samuel Pepys and Oliver Cromwell.“I never learned about anybody that looked like me. And with the World Wars, there were black people involved, but it was not documented in school.”Trevor: “Schools are trying to tackle these things. What I think may be more important is the fact that figures of authority in our schools, by and large, are not black.If I had a criticism of where we are in the schools system, it is less the curriculum but more what you see and feel every day as you go into school.”Anthony: “We have a problem within the Afro-Caribbean community with the curriculum. We have state schools that produce a certain agenda and private schools that have control and produce a certain agenda.I would like to see what can be done to connect the two.”“WOULD removing statues be to lie about our history, as the Prime Minister has suggested ”Patrick: “Anybody that had benefitted from slavery in this huge way, andthey have been celebrated for it, then yes, those statues should come down.”Stuart: “I flip-flop on this one. A  to discuss which statues should come down is a side distraction.The main point is equality for everyone, for every black person. If we have more representatives at the top table, other issues will be sorted along the way.”Katharine: “I am a headmistress so I would always be telling our children not to go round tearing down statues.“It is very dficult to decide who goes and who stays, which is I why I have come to the conclusion that ­plaques by the statues are the best way forward so we can all learn something.”Trevor: “I would never want the whole statue thing to become an excuse for people saying, ‘Look we took down the statue – we have done something.’“What leans me slightly against pulling them down is I don’t want people to forget.If we pretend transatlantic ­slavery was just about some particularly nasty iniduals, andwe get rid of them, that is fine – but we are making out there were some bad people who did bad things, rather than the monstrous crime transatlantic slavery was.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jessica is terried she will never work again.“Meghan has forsaken her most loyal friend just to look woke.”Former actress Meghan, , met Jessica in Toronto while filming US legal drama Suits.But she distanced herself from her after she was exposed by Canadian influencer and blogger Sasha Exeter for using her “wealth and privilege” to attempt to shut her up in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement.The scandal started last month when Sasha posted a “call to action” to people with large online followings to support the Black Lives Matter movement.Sasha revealed that Jessica seemed to think this was aimed at her — even though it mentioned nobody by name — and sent her a string of offensive messages.She also claimed Jessica spoke to sponsors and companies that worked with her, which she said was “an attempt to silence a black woman during this movement behind closed doors”.She called her response “textbook white privilege”.Sasha also shared screenshots that showed Jessica threatening to sue her and which saw her sacked from her roles on bridal show I Do, Redo and Good Morning America.But a source close to Jessica said: “She was stupid and tone deaf but she’s definitely not racist.”After the scandal, Jessica — married to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney’s son Ben,  — tried to apologise by referring to her friendship with Meghan.She wrote on Instagram: “I have lived a very public and personal experience with my closest friend where race was front and centre.”However, her work prospects now appear in tatters as many companies employed her partly because of her connection to the royal, according to our sources.The insider added: “She is losing so much work from brands who loved her connection to Meghan in the past but now feels she has become toxic.“All it would take is for Meghan to go out on a shopping trip with Jessica to show she still has her support. But the clear indication is that there’s not going to be any show of support like that.“It’s a brutal blow after a ten-year friendship. Jessica has been there for Meghan through thick and thin.”Jessica became best friends with Meghan shortly after she joined the cast of Suits in .Meghan started spending most of her time in Toronto and they quickly bonded over their shared love of yoga and fashion. Jessica was a useful pal for the aspiring actress to have, as she is a high-profile stylist, influencer and a socialite in Canada.The pair quickly became close and started taking holidays together, posting pictures of their trips on social media.When Prince Harry, , and Meghan started dating and he visited her in Toronto, Jessica and Ben would host the couple at their family home.As their relationship blossomed and became more public, Jessica also found herself in the spotlight.When Meghan was seen with Harry at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in , she had her mother, Doria Ragland, alongside her as well as Jessica and Markus Anderson — who is said to have introduced her to the prince.Jessica was said to be Meghan’s “unofficial wedding planner”, jetting to London to finalise arrangements for the big day in .She also attended a small hen party for the future duchess and made herself available for dress fittings. Jessica was even said to have helped Meghan choose Givenchy as the designer.Both Jessica and Ben attended the wedding and all three of her children took part in the ceremony — Ivy, then four, was a bridesmaid and her then seven-year-old twins Brian and John were page boys. In February last year she also attended Meghan’s baby shower in New York along with stars including tennis ace Serena Williams.All the attention saw Jessica’s star status soar, but some pals say that made Meghan uncomfortable.However, the timing of the fallout could be particularly awkward for the duchess because Jessica could play a pivotal role in Meghan’s upcoming court case with the Mail on Sunday.Jessica is widely believed to be the anonymous friend who briefed People magazine about the letter Meghan sent to her father Thomas Markle.Pals think Meghan may need to try and keep Jessica onside to ensure she does not go rogueasked to participate in the case. However, Meghan is famous for ghosting those who were once close to her, with everyone from her school friends to her father to Piers Morgan being brutally cut off.In fact, the term “being Meghan Markled” is now recognised online as a relationship term describing when people are chopped out your le without warning.The source added: “When Meghan makes a decision to ghost someone she doesn’t usually go back.“But, when it comes to Jessica, hopefully she has learnt her lesson from the past and realises that it’s not a great idea.“Jessica knows all her secrets and everything she’s been through. This is not someone she wants to make an enemy of at this time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An idea that might have sounded funny, in a drunken Zoom meeting, with the “creatives”, but collapses the moment you see the first dog-cam footage.Five seconds of low-level barrelling, round Georgia Toffolo’s gaff, you feel queasy. Twenty and you’re probably spray-painting your own walls green, which is why the pets are accompanied everywhere by a camera crew. So what you’ve actually got here, on prime-time, is Dog In An Empty House.If at this point you’re expecting the guessing game to sustain your interest in Celebrity Snoop Dogs, I have more bad news. On Friday it lasted about as long as it took Kevin to describe the kitchen lighting as “ETERNAL” and the viewers to think “Right then, it’s Louise Redknapp”. Sure enough, ten minutes later: “Hi. I’m Louise Redknapp.”Not one of the great TV reveals, although it was positively bewitching compared to week one, when Kevin Bridges’ labrador Annie wandered past some football shirts, early on, and the owner was duty bound to point out at the end: “One of them says BRIDGES. So unless you’re a moron, you’d have probably guessed it was me.”Kevin’s got a point here, I think, and has also identied Channel ’s target audience. To such an extreme level I reckon even ITV might have thought, “It’s a bit beneath us.”Celebrity Snoop Dogs is beneath almost everyone, truth be told. Although the slightly galling thing for me personally is I appear to be an exception and part of that target audience as I had real problems with week one’s second celebrity, who’s got a lovely house in London and a lhasa apso with an underbite called Charlie, who looks like a Wookiee version of Keira Knightley.Yes, there were a lot of Strictly Come Dancing clues but no there wasn’t a dog house marked “Vernon”. I was already thinking about the host, though, when Kevin said “Grey drawers compliment the veins of marble” and couldn’t contain myself any longer when he added “It’s an antique clothes hanger”, so I actually shouted: “TESS DALY.”Sure enough, when the big reveal came, it was confirmed . . .  “Hi, I’m Shirley Ballas.”A fine woman who, it transpires, rescued Charlie from certain death. “He was about to be euthanised at a dog shelter” in Los Angeles.

or show no symptoms at all.It means that young people are actually at higher risk of spreading the virus to more vulnerable people, potentially without even realising.Some young people may also have underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic asthma and hypertension, which put them in the at-risk group.But there have been a number of cases in which young people have ended up in hospital or even dying from Covid without having any health issues.Last month, a -day-old baby with no known underlying conditions became Britains youngest coronavirus victim.  The most recent figures from the Office for National Statisticstoday showed that deaths overall in the UK are below normal - and coronavirus fatalities have fallen to the lowest level since before lockdown.But experts warn that while these figures are great news, it doesnt mean the pandemic is over.New positive cases of Covid- had been decreasing as a result of lockdown but this has levelled off in the past few weeks with infections stalling.Deaths tend to lag behind infections as it can take up to two weeks for symptoms to show, experts say.Also, people might not get tested immediately which could lead to a more severe illness and result in hospital care, or ultimately death.Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor at George Washington University School of Medicine, told \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"CNN: It takes about a week after someone becomes infected until they get sick enough to be hospitalised, and then often about a week after that until you start seeing deaths.Boris Johnson said the country had to meet five key tests before lockdown could be eased.These included making sure the rate of infection was decreasing to manageable levels.One of the ways this is tracked is by measuring the R rate - which refers to the average number of people that one infected person can pass the virus on to. If its above one, it will spread exponentially, infecting more and more people.With theR rate below the crucial value of one across the country, the Prime Minister was able to announce that the restrictions could ease further and on July  pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers were allowed to reopen.But some regions, such as the north east, are only just teetering under one, so officials are monitoring the situation carefully.There have also been localised outbreaks such as in Leicester, so the city has been forced back into lockdown to prevent the spread.The Government has warned that it wont hesitate to put other areas under tougher measures - forcing the economy to shutdown again -cases rise.While face masks arent guaranteed to stop someone from catching the virus, they can be helpful in preventing infected people from spreading it.They can stop viral particles from sneezes, coughs and even talking from being released.Currently, Brits have to wear a face mask or covering when using public transport or face being fined.Experts have also advised people to wear one when in places where its harder to socially distance, such as supermarkets.Its not compulsory but some experts are calling on the Government to make face coverings mandatory.Homemade masks wont offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasnt stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.The president of the Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan said other countries have managed to implement the use of face masks into their daily lives so there was no reason why the UK should not have implemented a more stringent policy.Meanwhile, new research by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.However, they need to be worn properly - intermittently putting them on and off increases the number of times you touch your face.For the general public, more effective methods of protecting yourself from infection include regularly washing your hands, not touching your face, disinfecting surfaces, and social distancing.Brits have been advised not to purchase surgical coverings due to a shortage or personal protective equipment for NHS workers.The Government has released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.If you already have a mask then there is no harm in wearing it, but make sure your mask is sanitised and that your hands are clean when taking it off and putting it on. And wash your hands again after taking it off.Most people who catch coronavirus only show symptoms about five days after being infected - but it can take up to  days in some cases.One study, published in the Lancet, found that during the initial five days - where people reported feeling fine - is when the highest amount of viral shedding happens.This is when infectious particles from the virus spread from one person to another.Experts still dont know how many people are asymptomatic, which is why it is important to self-isolate for  daysyou have knowingly been exposed to the virus.Its also vital to quarantine evenyou dont have the key symptoms of a persistent cough or a fever.The Government recently added a loss of taste or smell to the list of signs that could suggest a mild form of Covid-.Less common symptoms may include myalgia , nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, soyou feel unwell always contact NHS .With widespread job losses, economic recession and being confined to our homes at the forefront of our mind, its easy to see why this theory crops up.But allowing everyone to become infected with coronavirus - to gain whats known as herd immunity - could have serious negative impacts.A team of scientists at Imperial College London modelled what this would look like in the UK and predicted that it could lead to a quarter of a million deaths that would completely overwhelm the NHS for months.It would also prevent people from accessing healthcare, emergency services and even prescriptions for normal medical reasons, while doctors and nurses are off sick.People could begin dying from minor conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks, pregnancy complications, everyday accidents, bacterial infections and more.Experts from \" href\"https:www.kcl.ac.uk blog-the-ten-most-dangerous-coronavirus-myths-debunked-\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Kings College London say that instead of this scenario, governments are aiming to eventually achieve widespread immunity with vaccination - when one becomes available. This way a large part of the population will become immunised in a controlled manner, drastically minimising the devastating potential of the virus.While flu cases decline over the summer, experts dont yet knowthis is what will happen with Covid-.The warmer weather can help as people can spend more time outdoors, where its easier to socially distance.Thats why doctors are concerned about a second wave this winter.But as its a brand new virus, humans havent developed a level of immunity yet, so evenit is seasonal, prevalence may continue to increase as it infects more of the population.Coronavirus spreads via droplets from coughs and sneezes, but you dont necessarily have to be close to the infected person to catch it.It can easily live on a range of surfaces for several days.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.In fact, the US Centres for Disease Control and Preventiondiscovered that Covid- survived on surfaces for  days - after infected passengers disembarked from a cruise ship.So disinfecting surfaces and washing your hands regularly is so vital to stop the spread.An alcohol-based disinfectant is enough to kill the virus on surfaces.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now he appears to know several other commands.Devine said she was inspired to try out the soundboard with Bunny after seeing other dog owners use the training method online.She decided to try the method with Bunny after seeing videos of speech language pathologist Christina Hunger have success using the communication technique with her dog, Stella.Devines soundboard technique gradually developed to be more advanced.The first soundboard that we used was one that I had made after following Christinas guidance on her blog, she said. We used that for several months before I connected with Leo Trottier, who is a cognitive scientist.He was looking for beta testers of a new device and that is the board we are currently using with Bunny.In another video posted to TikTok, Devine acknowledged that its dficult to say for sureBunny actually knows what she is communicating.I am not a scientist but I recognize that large amounts of data need to be collected before we can make a judgment as to whether or not Bunny actually understands what shes saying, she said.Im also aware that I inevitably skew the data in favor of saying that Bunny is consciously communicating with me.Either way, she said, its a fun and exciting experiment to try out with the beloved family pup.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A poll of , adults found  per cent donapost feel they can make any eco-friendly changes to their current lestyle, because their bank balance wonapost allow it. The average person has just £ disposable income per month, but seven in  wish they had more to allow them to live a greener lestyle. Organic food, electric cars, energy-saving bulbs and double glazing are just some of the aposgreen itemsapos Brits would love to buy, but simply canapost afford. And as many as eight in  adults say the government should do more to incentivise home owners to help save the planet. Claire Tracey, Chief Strategy  Sustainability Officer for Nationwide Building Society which carried out the study said: Financial constraints shouldnapost hold people back from being able to be more eco-friendly. We welcome the Government making up to £k available to homeowners to retrofit their homes. Our study shows that many consumers who want to go green are prevented from doing so by the price of ethical and sustainable products. This new incentive is therefore a helpful start to making the UKaposs homes greener. At Nationwide, we want to help our  million members reduce the carbon footprints of their homes, whether they own or rent them. Greening our homes for future generations is a joint effort between the public, the Government and lenders like us. As we green our economy, it is critically important to make it work for everyone. The study also found almost half of those polled would love to be able to install solar  into their home, while a third would buy an environmentally-friendly laptopmoney allowed. A quarter would like to have organic towels and bedding, while other small purchases such as eco-friendly dishwasher tablets, compostable bin liners and recycled toilet paper are wanted but off-limits due to the cost. Brits would also like to install low-flow shower heads , purchase a solar powered lawn mowerand have solar powered charging stations for gadgets- but canapost afford to splash out on such aposluxuriesapos. It emerged six in  adults wish they had enough money to make signicant changes to their home that would help the planet, with the average adult estimating theyaposd need to fork out an additional £ a month to make a dference. Other barriers stopping Brits from going green include an unwillingness to changeand not really understanding how to alter behaviour . But the cost of goods is the overwhelming factor, with  per cent saying the price of buying locally and ethically is unobtainable for many. The study, carried out via Onepoll, found there is a general willingness among  per cent of adults to try and help the planet, when money allows. More than half of Brits will walk rather than drive at any given opportunity, and a third are making a conscious effort to eat less meat. Taking reusable carrier bags shopping has become the norm for  per cent of adults, while two-thirds try to recycle when they can. And just under half of those polled try to turn off all household technology when not using. Other methods commonly adopted include avoiding buying plastic when possible, having a compost bin and getting the food shopping delivered. But sadly,  per cent would definitely make more effort to be eco-friendlyit didnapost cost so much money, and  per cent are worried how their current shopping choices might impact the environment and future of the planet. Nationwide already offers a Green Additional Borrowing mortgage which has cheaper rates in order to fund improvements such as better insulation, new windows, solar  and even electric car charging stations.

Health officials have warned aposlocal lockdownsapos will be required going forward as the country learns to adapt to outbreaks of Covid- on a more regional level. One lockdown is ongoing in Leicester after a sharp increase in positive tests. The number of cases being found in Leicester was the highest in the country per ,, going from  to  cases in seven days to June . This was when Leicester went into lockdown with an infection rate three times higher than the next highest local area. But in good news today Health Secretary Matt Hancock, asked directly about Leicester, said the seven-day infection rate in the city has fallen to  per , people. He said the development underlined the importance of the dficult but vital decision to impose a lockdown. The Merseyside borough of Knowsley saw the sharpest increase in cases, from six to  per , in the seven days to June . Six areas have seen the infection rate per , increase over the week to June , according to the statistics. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES ARE STILL GOING UPMerthyr Tydfil has increased from . cases per , to . Knowsley has increased from . cases per , to . Bolton has increased from . cases per , to . Sheffield has increased from . cases per , to . Doncaster has increased from . cases per , to . Blackpool has increased from . cases per , to .The huge rise at Merthyr Tydfil, which takes it beyond Leicester, has been attributed to a cluster of  positive cases at Kepakaposs St Merryn meat plant.  Public Health Wales has said the surge in cases stems from increased testing with most of the positive cases uncovered on the same day. Factory floors are coming into sharp focus as having the potential for rapid cluster outbreaks with garment factories in Leicester also linked to a sharp increase in cases. On July  Bolton’s director of public health, Dr Helen Lowey, said: “The current situation in Bolton is very dferent to that in Leicester.The number of cases being confirmed in Bolton has been in decline over the past two weeks. “We will continue to closely review the data for Bolton and advise any measures that become necessary. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth - a Leicester MP - asked what would trigger the lting of the lockdown in the city. He said: What is the exit strategy for Leicester  How does an area that has gone into a local lockdown escape from a local lockdown  Mr Ashworth said in Germany, lockdowns were lted when cases got down to  per , people. Mr Hancock said  days of data were needed and the next steps would be announced on July .He would not give a specic figure for lting the lockdown because both the level and the rate of change matters. If the level were lower but it was going up, that could be a worse situation than a higher level that is under control and falling, he added. The statistics do show some good news with areas that had previously been a concern showing a fall in cases per ,, indicating it is likely the key aposRapos rate in the area is below one. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES HAVE SHARPLY FALLENBradford where cases have decreased from . per , to . Gwynedd where cases have gone down from . per , to . Wrexham where cases have plunged from . per , to . In Barnsley cases have dropped from . per , to .The drop in Wrexham is supporting the belief held by Public Health Wales that an outbreak at a meat factory in the area has not widely spread into the community.  AREAS WHERE CASES ARE BEING REPORTED AFTER ZERO INFECTIONSArds and North Down had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases Armagh City Banbridge Craigavon had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases Fe had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases Newport had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases South Tyneside had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases Torfaen had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases West Berkshire had . cases per , after previous week showed  cases And in Scotland travel restrictions have been lted in Dumfries and Galloway after a coronavirus outbreak was brought under control, according to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Speaking during her daily briefing in Edinburgh, she said all chains of infection in the area have been identied and controlled.

Has your pub been forced to close because a customer has tested positive for coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror It reads: This isn’t the message we wanted to write so soon but The Lighthouse will be closed due to a customer testing positive to Covid-. We are slowly getting through our list of customers that were in the pub on Saturday. All our staff are going to be tested and we will reopen when the time is safe to do so. Thanks to all the positive phone calls. Prior to The Lighthouse opening it had posted on its Facebook page a list of new rules that customers must stick to including all patrons must give their name and address to staff and sanitise before entering entering the building.  It also stated that furniture should not be moved for any reason as it has been placed to comply with social distancing and there is a one way system throughout the premises. The post also says: Please understand that this is a learning curve for us all and I am sure some measures may change very quicklythe system fails to work. We are in this together to keep all of us safe, hope to see you all soon. The Lighthouse Family. The Fox  Hounds, in Batley, West Yorkshire, also reopened on Saturday and announced they were closed in a Facebook post today.  The pubs are believed to be the first in England to close and have to contact customers due to coronavirus. The post said: Following our announcement this morning that we will be closed until further notice Iaposd like to put all rumours and speculations straight that are currently floating about. This morning I got a phone call off a customer which visited our pub on Saturday to say theyaposd tested positive for coronavirus. On their visit they were unaware and had no symptoms but after seeing a post off another place theyaposd visited thought it was best to take a test to which they came back positive.  Due to privacy reasons we wonapost be naming this person. Following this information we are awaiting further guidance from NHS and track and trace. Myself and all staff have taken a test today and we should have results back within  hours. The pub manager added that the premises will be deep cleaned before they reopen.  The post ended: We fully understand this is a scary time but want to ensure our customer safety is our main priority in these tough times. Over the past few weeks we have put a lot of hard work into the pub following government guidance to get us opened back up. Anyone that has visited us this weekend can see our new layout of tables of one metre plus, our one way systems, full table service and continuously cleaning throughout. A third pub in Alverstoke, Hampshire, also announced on its Facebook that a customer had tested positive for Covid- so it was closed.  The Village Home posted: We have had a case of Coronavirus in the pub which means that some of us are in isolation.The pub is now shut but all being well will open again on Saturday.Anyone who was in the pub over the weekend there is no need to isolate unless you show symptoms or are contacted direct by the trace group. Thank you and hope to see you soon.  In addition to pubs, hairdressers, restaurants, cafes and campsites also reopened after the government eased lockdown restrictions to get the nation moving again.However worrying scenes of hundreds of drinkers ignoring social distancing rules and carnage in the streets over the weekend have sparked fresh fears of a second wave of coronavirus and local lockdowns. Police had to break up fights and deal with other trouble while some revellers overindulged on aposSuper Saturdayapos which one top cop said was as busy as New Yearaposs Eve.

He was given a -day home curfew between pm and am as part of a community order for possession of the drugs. Larner has suffered from PTSD and insomnia since he was stabbed in the terrorist attack, Croydon Magistratesapos Court heard.

He was found dead on June  following a coffee catch-up with his mum. She recalled Mike, who lived in Worcester, as seeming aposfull of joyapos and looking forward to a job interview he had secured. His devastated mum, who is a teacher, is sharing his story to raise awareness of mental health in a bid to prevent suicide.She told the BBC he was “the kind of person who always worried about someone .”The mum-of-two added: Mike was the le and soul of the party who always put others first and worried about everyone but himself. He had only been at the job for approximately six weeks and they couldnapost afford to keep him on after furlough so got rid of him. He was a really smart man with a bright future ahead of him yet he felt inadequate because he couldnapost get a job after months of applying. The financial strain and being alone all day, every day, began to affect him. I was with him on the day he died, we laughed and joked whilst drinking coffee - he seemed fine and he was in good spirits. When I left his home, he was cooking dinner - it breaks my heart that I didnapost know how he was really feeling.  I received a call at midnight stating he had attempted suicide - I live  minutes away and by the time i had got there, it was too late. I felt helpless and it is a horrendous feeling knowing he was hurting so bad but felt like he couldnapost reach out to anyone. We were incredibly close and I thought he could tell me anything, we had previously been to the doctors for him to get help - they gave him medication and put him on a six-month waiting list. It is frustrating that they werenapost able to sit and speak to him because maybe he would still be here today. Mike was a keen American football player, and he hoped to pursue a career in motor sport engineering. Rachel is urging other young men with depression to seek help. She said: I was the kind of mum that always gave him privacy and space but supported him in everything he did. Mike and I were really close - we would go motor racing as he was in to cars. And off-roading with him driving land rovers! I miss him so much - I will miss him popping in for a cup of tea or our shopping trips - he would always make me laugh by trying on silly things.

During the chat Harry, who is president of the QCT, said thereaposs no way the Commonwealth of  nations could progress without first coming to terms with its past and human rights legacy. He said: Certainly, when you look across the Commonwealth there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past. And I think so many people have done such an amazing, incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs. But I think we all acknowledge, on here, that there is so much more still to do.  Itaposs not going to be easy and in some cases itaposs not going to be comfortable but it needs to be done because guess what  Everybody benefits. Meghan continued: We have to, in this moment in time, say aposweaposre going to have to be a little uncomfortable right nowapos because itaposs only in pushing through that discomfort that we get to the other side of this and find the place, as youaposre pointing out, where a high tide raises all ships. Mr Neilaposs barbed comments sparked a debate with some coming to the princeaposs defence. One chimed: Are they allowed to have opinions ! Another said: Thereaposs nothing controversial in the princeaposs comments here. He and Meghan are using their public profile and connection to the British State to raise awareness and prod for change. But others agreed with Mr Neilaposs assessment and went on to accuse Harry of undermining the interests of the UK. The discussion about the Commonwealthaposs colonial history and hand in the slave trade is a subject close to Harry and Meghan. It is all the more topical given the wave of mass discontent sweeping the global about racial inequality following the death of George Lloyd at the hands of US cops. Meghan also spoke about how they had to make the time and “found it a huge honour” to speak to global leaders. Last month Harry warned the world about the issue of unconscious bias which leads to people unknowingly practising racist behaviour.

For those who have been affected by HIV and AIDS, the examples of resilience within oneaposs self and the community, have been felt and fostered for decades.

Landlady Jess Green said the experience had been stressful after making her way through every person who had been in the pub after lockdown eased on Saturday and pubs were allowed to open their doors once more. She told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: The main thing that was going through our heads was we had to make sure everyone was safe, that we contacted everyone of our customers. We took it upon ourselves, because obviously Test and Trace can do all that, but we took it upon ourselves to do it because we knew that we had done it before it got out there. It took us all day, we finished at about  oaposclock last night. Ourwas about  and there were actually more butthey were in a social bubble or a household, we took the main person and they spoke to the people they were with, so it could have been more than that. When asked what the experience was like, she said: Stressful - thataposs probably the only word I can use. The Lighthouse Inn was one of three pubs which opted to shut after coronavirus cases were identied among their drinkers on the weekend. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Matt Hancock heralded the trioaposs example as evidence that the test and trace system was working.

Mr Hancock told MPs the pubs were doing the right thing by their customers and by their communities. This is NHS Test and Trace working precisely as intended, he added. Three pubs shut so that others can be open. The Fox and Hounds in Batley said it would be closed until further notice after receiving a call from a customer on Monday to say they had tested positive for coronavirus.Posting on its Facebook page, it said all staff had since taken a test and added that the pub will be fully deep cleaned and when safe to do so we will reopen our doors."},{"url":null,"title":"shocking moment man repeatedly struck","story":"NewsShocking moment man repeatedly struck by thugs through broken car window after crashWest Midlands Police are hunting for two men after a crash in the Erdington area of Birmingham led to a driver being repeatedly struck while in his vehicleShareByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video horric-moment-man-is-repeatedly-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news shocking-moment-man-repeatedly-struck-\"\", url\"News, views and top stories .

A study of over s found those taking them were % less likely to die from any cause and suggests more Brits should take them. The once a day pills also slashed the risk of succumbing to a heart attack or stroke by a fth. US researchers looked at data on over , US veterans between  and  who were at least  and had not previously had a heart attack or stroke. They identied more than , who began taking statins during this time and found a signicant link with reduced deaths. The benefits even applied to iniduals in their s and those with dementia. It adds to evidence that thousands of deaths could be prevented every yearmore elderly people were prescribed them. Lead author Dr Ariela Orkaby, of Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston, said: “Based on these data, age is not a reason to not prescribe statins. “Statins are commonly studied and prescribed for middle-aged adults but understudied in people over age . “One of the most remarkable things about our results is we found the benefit of statins held true regardless of whether a person was older or younger or had a condition such as dementia.”  The drugs are taken by more than six million Britons but only around a third of . million over s. They lower levels of ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol - preventing blood clots which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. It is known they protect against heart attacks, strokes and death in the middle-aged. But in  major clinical trials, only % of participants have been  or older.

The rampaging cyclone is currently churning through the Atlantic Ocean and is set to reach the UK by Thursday on the back of two straight days of showers. However, parts of the country will see highs of C today with plenty of humidity despite the likelihood of rain - while next week could see Britain top C, according to some forecasters.Netweather weather charts show temperatures hitting C between next Sunday and July  but the forecaster has also indicated C is possible.While BBC weather maps suggest highs of C in London by Tuesday next week with the south set to see several days of warm and dry weather. And the Met Officeaposs long range forecast states: Temperatures are likely to be either around or on the warmer side of average, with the warmest conditions likely in the southeast. BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes, meanwhile, said two lumps of cloud are set to bring rain for today and tomorrow before Edouard arrives, with no sign of the weather settling down just yet. He said Tuesday will see thicker cloud edging in and once the rainaposs set in itaposs going to be windy for much of the day - with wind gusts hitting mph by the evening, according to the Met Office.London will see the best of the heat and humidity today, but sunshine is also likely in Scotland before showers move in by the afternoon. Mr Fawkes said the rain will become a little more confined to the south on Wednesday and will continue in pulses - light one minute and then a bit heavier.  Then Edouard - who will be considerably less energised by the time he reaches Britain - will bring more rain. The Environment Agency has issued one flood alert in London today, affecting the Thames between Putney Bridge and Teddington Weir, and a flood warning in Keswick, Cumbria. UK  day weather forecast Today: Early cloud and rain over Ireland will spread eastwards across much of England and Wales, rain heavy at times in the west. Southern UK staying dry with some bright spells. Sunny spells for Scotland, but also a few sharp showers. Tonight: Early evening rain over Wales and northern and central England sinking southwards into southern UK. Some heavy rain in West Wales. Scotland drier, clearer and chilly.

What begins as a small issue over things like noise complaints or shared spaces can lead to years of passive-aggressive behaviour. And it appears one neighbour may have just sparked a Titanic battle of back and forth when it comes to their front garden. Twitter user @Chialton saw his tweet go viral after posting a photo showing the results of his neighbouraposs lawn mowing, writing: Next door with top class grass banter. In the image, the lawn in front of the two neighbouring properties has been cut on one side, creating a perfect line in the grass where the drainpipe separates the two homes - and leaving behind a measly patch of uncut grass no more than a metre wide on one side. The post racked up more than , likes and ided opinion, with some slamming it as petty while others argued they saw no issue. The user who uploaded the photo hilariously added: Decided Iaposm going to leave it, when their grass grows back Iaposll mow mine. I will like this game. One reply labelled it   for pettiness and plenty of people came back with their own suggestions of how to take revenge. Never cut that piece of grass, ever. Let it become a jungle, one comment read. A second said: You need to knock and seeyou can borrow his lawn mower.  Another added: Put a string line from wall square of house which will show he has cut part of yours. Then note through door saying please do the cut my grass again. But some people argued they would have done the same, as one replied: Not sure why you expect them to do it  I get itaposs just a bit, but itaposs still yours.

When Levi advised him to get out and delete her off everything, Kevin revealed he was currently stuck sitting next to her, unable to move as his leg was covering the stain. A later update read: Smell starting to become noticeable. Think Iaposm going to make an escape soon. However, when the woman left the room he seized his opportunity and flipped the bedsheets so the mark was on the opposite side, as well as spilling some beer on the area for good measure.  He made his getaway before she could notice and, maybe somewhat unsurprisingly, the pair havenapost spoken since aposthe incidentapos. Kevin said: I ate a burger and chips from Burger King and drank  litre of Hennessy the night before. We went back to bed for a bit watching the TV show aposNormal Peopleapos and I then realised something was off. I swapped the sheets around to her side of the bed and spilt beer on the stains. It’s not looking good for the relationship. He may have felt confident in getting away with it until the exchange went viral on social media after being posted by Levi with the caption: My mate has had a nightmare here, staying over in some girlaposs house heaposs been seeing.

Whilst most of us simply run our produce under cold running water to rid it of any dirty or creepy crawlies, this woman puts them in the dishwasher. Hmm... Taking to TikTok, the woman explained how she avoids wasting unnecessary time washing the goods by hand, instead opting to put them in the dishwasher for a quick cycle - and we have to admit itaposs pretty unique. To the top tray she lines up fruit like apples, kiwis, grapes, and avocados. And to the bottom shelf she adds raspberries, tomatoes and blueberries - separated by plastic trays - pineapple, melon alongside a few other items. Then she adds around a cap ful of distilled white vinegar to the opening where you would usually add your detergent. Before selecting a light setting and pressing start on the machine. Then before you know it, the cycle is complete and everything has been given a good old rinse.

Jordan Tye, , arrived in Lleida in the northeastern Catalonia region on Friday for work - but he warned other Brits I would stay away from Spain. He described the city as like a ghost town and was shocked by how it changed from one day to the next.Police at roadblocks began warning drivers they were entering a lockdown zone on Saturday as Spainaposs northeastern region of Catalonia reimposed restrictions on more than , people following several new coronavirus outbreaks.Residents in Segria, which includes the city of Lleida, are not allowed to leave the area, although they will not have to stay at home as was the case during Spainaposs original lockdown.

If you are in Lleida you canapost exit andyou are outside you canapost enter. I got into Lleida a couple of days ago. The first day the city was full of people and we went out for meals. Then yesterday it was like a ghost town. Everything looked shut when I was walking around, shutters were down, police were everywhere. All you can hear are ambulance sirens. Last night there was not a soul on the streets.  He continued: Spain is not a nice place to be in at the moment. Itaposs mega expensive, thereaposs not much public transport. Youaposve got to wear face masks and gloves everywhere. Itaposs a nightmare. I wouldnapost advise anyone to come to Spain, I would stay away. As soon as Iaposm done here Iaposll be on a flight back home. He said it reminds him of how the UK was during its aposworstapos time in the pandemic.Mr Tye, an installations manager for an engineering company who travels all around Europe, has an authorisation letter to travel from his company - meaning he is exempt from the rules. But he saidheaposd have known what the situation in the region would be like he would absolutely not have gone. Mr Tye, who spent a few days in Barcelona last week, is due to spend another two weeks in Lleida but is planning on moving hotels to stay outside of the exclusion zone.

Aerial images of a farm in Asia show thousands of the animals strewn across the floor – some still alive – waiting to be carted off on the back of a lorry. TV wildle presenter and campaigner Chris Packham described it as “like a scene from hell” and one of the worst cases of animal cruelty he has witnessed. More than  million animals are killed each year for their fur including mink, fox, raccoon dog, chinchilla and rabbit – three every second. They typically spend their lives in one-metre-squared battery cages and are only moved twice – for weaning and on the day they die. Since a  fur farming ban in the UK, pelts worth £million have been imported. Much of the fur comes from China, the US, France, Italy and Poland. In  almost £m of animal fur was imported, including £.m from China alone. Today the Daily Mirror is calling for an immediate ban on the sale of fur products in the UK. Joining forces with Humane Society International UK, we also want an end to animals being trapped for their skins here, and repercussions for businesses knowingly passing off real fur as fake. The footage was captured by the charity’s investigators. The exact location has not been revealed to protect their identity for fear of punishment. One of the team said: “I’ve never seen so much death in one place. It really shocked me and I had to steady myself to keep filming. “There was a mountain of dead bodies, there must have been  tens of thousands of animals discarded like rubbish, like their lives meant nothing.”  He also captured animals repetitively pacing and swaying their heads, classic signs of mental distress and boredom. Animals are kept in rows of cages in long sheds exposed to the elements. Cages are barren apart from the faeces on the floor. Water dishes were also empty. But that is the least of their problems. When the foxes and raccoon dogs are a year old and their winter coats have developed, they are repeatedly smashed over the head with a metal bar while terried cage mates helplessly bark. Investigators also captured what experts say is strong evidence of a fox regaining consciousness after being fully skinned and thrown on a pile.  HSI UK veterinary consultant Professor Alastair MacMillan said: “The pain of that would be unimaginable. This footage is absolutely appalling. The stunning and slaughtering process is done with such a flagrant lack of skill or care, making it highly likely that many of these foxes did not lose consciousness and suffered severe pain. “Equally, a signicant proportion could have regained consciousness before, during and even after they had been skinned.” Packham gave his backing to the sales ban campaign, saying: “I am astonished at the depravity of the fur trade. It is like a scene from hell and anyone who knowingly wears fur should not turn away from watching it. Aside from the unbelievable cruelty of their deaths, these foxes and raccoon dogs will have endured utterly miserable lives. “There can be no place in British shops and wardrobes for fur, not when this is the price animals pay.”  The world’s total fur sales in  totalled £.billion, according to the Fur Information Council of America. Some fur creations were seen on the catwalks at Milan Fashion Week this year but designers including Prada, Gucci, Armani, Versace, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, DKNY, Burberry and Chanel have ditched it. In , Calornia became the first US state to ban fur sales. This year, Hawaii and Rhode Island followed. Many British retailers are actively fur-free but clothes, shoes and accessories made of fur can still be found on the high street and online – whether the buyer knows it or not. A Daily Mirror investigation found real fur clothes masquerading as fake, made from the pelts of foxes, rabbits and raccoon dogs, from as little as £ in shopping centres and markets.  It is estimated % of China’s wildle trade is dedicated to fur production, making it the world’s biggest.In the Netherlands,  mink fur farms have been closed down after animals were confirmed as infected with the coronavirus strain that causes Covid-. More than , mink were culled by government order.Three farms in Denmark infected with the coronavirus are also shut. Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International UK said: “Behind the PR spin of the fur trade, this is the hideous, heartless reality they don’t want you to see.  “Raccoon dogs driven mad with boredom in their pitully small wire cages, foxes repeatedly smashed over the head with a metal bar in front of their terried cage mates, animals skinned alive so that the fur trade can sell consumers the lie of luxury. “I am sickened and heartbroken by what our investigators witnessed on these cruel farms, but not surprised.“Every designer putting fur on the catwalk, every retailer putting fur on its shop shelves, and everyconsumer putting fur in their wardrobe, is helping to pay for this shameful misery.“It needs to stop, and the UK is now in a unique position to take action by banning fur sales.

Roman Trofimov says he has been stranded in the Philippines during lockdown after getting stuck on a dream trip to southeast Asia. In a bizarre saga reminiscent of the Tom Hanks film The Terminal, the Estonian national claims to have been eating and sleeping in Manila airport for months and washing in the bathrooms. He is pleading to be rescued from the airport, where he has been in limbo since he arrived on an AirAsia flight from Bangkok on March . Mr Trofimov can be seen sporting a long beard and shaggy hair in viral Facebook posts documenting his plight - in which he claims to be surviving on food and snacks donated by airport staff. He shared pictures of his aposmealsapos of bottled water and chocolate bars on social media, claiming he has been told he must stay put until local quarantine rules change as he begs for help. The stranded tourist claims the airport is like a ghost-town - with staff rarely to be seen, and most flights grounded. Mr Trofimov claims he had to sleep on the terminalaposs floor and on metal benches at first.  Eventually the Estonian consulate stepped in to help him be transferred to the passenger lounge on April , he said. According to ERR media he hails from the eastern Estonian town of Jõhvi. He first arrived in southeast Asia via Thailand, in a transfer from Novosibirsk, Russia. According to his series of Facebook posts, Mr Trofimov claims he saved up a year for the dream trip.  He was travelling in Southeast Asia when coronavirus lockdowns began kicking in, and he claims his passport was taken before going through immigration. The airline he flew in on was also unable tohim to Thailand as flights around the world were being grounded due to fears over the deadly virus.  He claims he was then denied entry into the Philippines due to entry visas no longer being issued for arrivals as Covid- began ramping up its march around the globe. Mr Trofimov was among travellers around the world caught up in the chaos as airlines halted travel and countries rush to close their borders.  While most tourists stranded managed to jet home on last-minute flights or were repatriated by their governments, Mr Trofimov claims to have been struck ever since. His plight is eerily similar to the plot of the -comedy Terminal, in which Hanksapos character Viktor Narovski is stuck in New Yorkaposs John F. Kennedy Airport terminal for months due to a military coup in his home country, an Eastern European state that is never named. Mr Trofimov likened his own situation to being a prisoner.  Documenting his plight, he said: aposaposIaposve been stuck here for more than  days. I need help getting out. The airline said I need to wait for Enhanced Community Quarantine to be over before I am allowed to fly. Iaposve been waiting here ever since.aposapos Mr Trofimov claimed he had an onward flight to Cebu province booked for the same day on March  and aflight to Bangkok for April . But both were cancelled.  The desperate tourist said he had asked his embassy for help but they were unable to organise a repatriation flight. Coronavirus restrictions have been implemented in the Philippines according to the risk level of each region. TheManila, where the airport is located, was under the Enhanced Community Quarantinefor a few months before it shted to a lower level General Community Quarantine in June. However, despite having a more relaxed guideline under the GCQ status, most flights are still not allowed to resume - including to Estonia.  Mr Trofimov, who has a bad back, added: I am a person with disability, my health is getting worse because of malnutrition, lack of sun, and fresh air. I have no other choice, but to go public please share with news agencies. According to ERR, Mr Trofimov explained he had been hoping to travel in southeast Asia for months before he got stuck. He said: This was my dream. I compared both Thailand and the Philippines and couldnapost decide which country would be better to travel to for months to free myself of stress and the hustle and bustle of the city that my nerves couldnapost take anymore.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Estonian media it is aware of Trofimovaposs situation and is looking for a way tohim home. The ministry told ERR they were made aware of Trofimovaposs situation on March , when the man had reached Manila Airport, where he was not allowed further entry to the country due to travel restrictions. Estonian officials told news site ERR it is trying to help Trofimov organise a flight after he initially declined toto Estonia, but has since expressed a desire toto country.

kids in the town every day for  weeks.The initiative has now come to an end, with a big barbecue held on Friday to mark the occasion – treating  children to burgers and ice-cream.Michelle, , admitted she had no idea the scheme was going to last as long as it did when she started it in March.And the project even drew the attention of the Duchess of York, who donated £, to the farm shop as well as providing recipe packs and treats of shortbread and yoghurt.Michelle said: “It was something I saw on Facebook, and I thought that’s something I could do as well, and it would make such a dference to these kids.“But I can’t believe how much of a dference it’s made.“The amount of people that have got in touch with me to say it’s really helped them get through the lockdown, it#s been part of their lockdown routine, they could walk to the farm shop and get their lunch.”She added: “It’s a lot of credit to a lot of people, and especially to Leigh Barker and Shirley Dow. They’re the girls who are in the shop most of the time.“Leigh came to us when the schools stopped, because she was a school cook, and she’s been doing most of the cooking for the kids as well.”Jill Thomson, , a furloughed major emergency management instructor for Petrovac from Craigearn, was one of the volunteers who helped to keep the Kemnay kids fed.She said: “I’ve admired Michelle and her team, and how hard they’ve worked over the entire lockdown period. I’m glad to be a small part of it.“If it wasn’t for Michelle and her tribe of girls this would never have happened.”As well as donating money, the Duchess of York also dedicated a story reading session on her YouTube channel to children at primary schools in the area.A spokesman for the Duchess said: “The Duchess is so happy to be able to carry on helping with what she hopes have been delicious school meals for all the children.“She knows what a tough time it is for many people and is delighted to do her bit.“As before, she hopes the children have also been watching and enjoying her storytime with Fergie and Friends every day on YouTube and reminds them that things will eventually get back to normal.”Jill said: “The Duchess’s generosity has really touched the heart of Kemnay community.”Looking back at the impact of the scheme, Michelle said: “I am so grateful to the girls who worked for me, they are absolute superstars and I could never have done this without them.“Louise , one of our volunteers, has made every delivery every day since we started. She’s been a superstar as well.“I’ll miss the kids, actually. We’ve really got to know a lot of them, and they come in just beaming, and we get little cards brought in or boxes of chocolates, or just pictures they’ve coloured in for us.“I’ll miss them, although I’m sure they’ll continue to come in and see me.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

We’d need to look carefully at the safety and supervision of the youngsters, but it could be a great opportunity for our younger fans.“If it’s feasible, priority would be given to our under- season ticket holders and our AberDNA Junior members.“We launched AberDNA Junior earlier this year to offer free membership to every child under  across the region with almost , already signed up. We had planned a signing on day at Pittodrie for these new, young members but this has been postponed due to lockdown.“Having these new, young fans into the stadium, perhaps earlier than other fans, would be a fantastic way for them to start their Dons journey.”When asked about the possibility of children being allowed into football grounds, Prof Leitch said: “When we get to crowds I think there may well be a thought that classes could go or school trips could.“I think that’s an excellent idea. The extra bit we’d need is the ability to gather in large groups outdoors, particularly for adults.“That will come in time.“I think the idea is a neat transition to actual crowds, physically distancing. I don’t think it’s a stupid idea.“It’s certainly worth exploring, but we are not there yet.“One of the challenges of schools going back on August  would be transportation. So we’re going to have to solve those problems.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

They would have worked seven days a week, from dawn till dusk.Like most Italian immigrants of the time, they built the business from nothing to create a small ice cream factory behind the cafe.The ice cream was made by hand and boiled in small quantities each day in response to the demand. They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf. Fiona Rutherford posted: ldquoLoved his cafe.Gillian Duffy said: ldquoAlways used to be the place to hang out at Alfiersquos when a teenager.Alan Fraser said: ldquoBrilliant recognition by the people of Musselburgh.Elaine Black added: ldquoHappy memories.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it. Surely an essential requirement for any sane food economy should be that it creates safe jobs for the people who work in it "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-scotland-puts-health-profit","story":"The Scottish Government is far from perfect but at least attempts to put the welfare of the citizenry before profit, which is certainly not an allegation that can be levelled at Mr Johnson and company, whose utter stupidity was neatly encompassed by their ldquocountries to fly to\" edicts.Mr Stevenson then attempts his knock-out blow with the \"its only a unied UK approach that can work as Scotland is too poor and too insignicant to pull itself out of the coming financial downturn.

Follow where, exactly  Following Mr Johnson leads to a leap over the hard Brexit clf, something Scotland never voted for. But letrsquos assume the PM knows what hersquos doing with the announcement of his pound billion \"New Deal\", which is just . per cent of UK GDP. The original New Deal in the US represented % of GDP, so there is just a wee bit of hyperbole going on here.It turns out that poundbn wonrsquot even meet half the cost of filling all the potholes in England and Wales, according to GMB Secretary Jude Brimble, and represents less than pound of spend per person. Furthermore, Mr Johnsonrsquos \"Project Speed\" is merely code for cutting workersrsquo rights and slashing environmental standards. He made no mention of investment in public services, starved after more than a decade of failed Tory austerity. The UK canrsquot build its way out of its current hole while local governments still have to cut vital public services.Contrast his announcement with the Scottish Governmentrsquos call last Monday for the UK to invest poundbn, which represents four per cent of the UKrsquos GDP, to begin to address the economic fallout from Covid-. This is the same proportion announced by the German government to kickstart its economic recovery. Reacting to Mr Johnsonrsquos ldquoNew Dealrsquo, Nicola Sturgeon said, ldquoTo put it mildly, Irsquom extremely underwhelmed. So should we all be.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.I AM currently writing from Germany, where I arrived about a fortnight ago. I was due to fly home with Eurowings from Cologne to Edinburgh on July . After my arrival in Germany, Eurowings cancelled the flight as a result of the UK quarantine requirements and a subsequent slump in demand. The airline has removed all flights to Scotland until August.I had hoped Eurowings would reinstate the service to Edinburgh once quarantine restrictions are lted for countries with a low Covid- infection rate ndash countries such as Germany. Now we learn that the quarantine will indeed be lted from July , but for England only.Nicola Sturgeons refusal to agree to end quarantine in line with Westminster means that there is no real prospect that Eurowings will relaunch flights to Scotland any time soon. In practice it means that I wont get back to Scotland with this airline and, in order to remain stranded here for the foreseeable time, Irsquoll have to pay for an expensive one-way flight with a dferent airline.My stay in Germany is by no means a leisure trip. There will be more people like me who travel for essential family and business reasons and now have to put up with more unnecessary uncertainty, inconvenience and extra cost just because the SNP and other devolved governments are in a huff.Withholding agreement to end this flawed quarantine policy for countries like Germany, which have a demonstrably better record on dealing with the pandemic and a sustained lower infection rate than Scotland, is simply unacceptable and a slap in face of our partners in the EU and beyond, effectively telling them that Scotland is firmly closed for business.Thankfully the UK Government has seen sense and ends quarantine for international travellers. Meanwhile I live in the hope that discussions between Westminster and the devolved administrations will lead to the Edinburgh Government giving up its nonsensical stance on this issue.Regina Erich, c o Essen, Germany, permanent address Stonehaven.ONCE again Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the most recent UK Governmentrsquos Covid- announcement, the air bridges quarantine policy .She certainly knew in advance that a policy was imminent and she may have a point that the Scottish Government was given little or no time to study it. However, now she wants time to fully peruse and examine the policy before either agreeing with it or dismissing it. My guess is that she will agree with it but it will probably not be introduced to Scotland until the usual one week later than England. We always seem to be trailing England, but again she always maintains that we have got to be safe and must not jump into decisions.The questions that arise are as follows. Why did the Scottish Government not draw up its own list of countries where an air bridge could be introduced  Would that have been too dficult, or is it because Ms Sturgeon wants the UK Government to do the research and development, so that she can be in a position to criticise Why are Scottish families who are now into the formal school holidays having to wait for her decision  As the schools willin mid-August, the clock is tickingthey want to get away for a European holiday, so delaying it will not give them much of an opportunity for an overseas break.It would certainly be very positive, and welcome,for once Ms Sturgeon could agree at once with a Covid- policy that originated from the UK Government. As our Prime Minister has stated the devolved governments are generally following the same route, the only thing is that we seem to be trailing behind as usual. What a shambles.John Cuthbertson, Leuchars.BORIS Johnson and his Government are in full-on self-congratulatory mode after achieving a deal with European countries over cross-border travel. We should be grateful that the rest of Europe is prepared to have us considering that, with the exception of Belgium, our Covid death and infection record is the worst in Europe by every measure.It is our European friends who are taking a risk allowing us in rather than the other way round. If I am able to take a European holiday this year, I will make sure to thank them.John Jamieson, Ayr.I AM disappointed, to put it mildly, that Judith Gillespie should suggest that ldquoScotland is becoming a country that is defined by its hatred of England and all things English\" . Such a isive assertion is absolute nonsense which in itself can only give rise to ill-feeling.It may well be the case that many of us domiciled in Scotland disapprove strongly of the approach of the hyper-nationalist clique in power in Westminster to such issues as immigration, Brexit, the handling of the pandemic, relationships with Donald Trump and Britainrsquos role in the world. That disapproval is shared with many in England, and thus should not be associated with nationalist sentiment north of the Border.John Milne, Uddingston.ACCORDING to David McEwan Hillhe was \"confused\" after reading the excellent letter from Dr Gerald Edwardsand then went on to make some astonishing claims about the Scottish economy. For example, he claimed that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports\". Really  This is nonsense, as UK companies exported pound billion worth of goods and services across the globe in  whereas Scotland only contributed pound.bn. He then made a lot of play about Scotland exporting power to England but failed to mention that most of the wind power is subsidised by the English taxpayersand with little back-up powerwill become very reliant on rUK for power.With regard to his comment about Scotland being the only \"viable economic unit\" in the UK when most people understand that London and the south-east of England are in a league of their own is equally laughable ndash notwithstanding the fact our fiscal deficitwas five times that of rUK.But he keeps the best to last with his assertionis that England somehow wants to \"hang on to us\".

Economies around the world have ground to a halt as governments scrambled to control the spread of the virus.Modern le does not offer many ndashany ndash opportunities to monitor the impact of switching off the economy. While it has taken a substantial toll, the lockdown has given us this opportunity and we must not waste it.Irsquom sure we have all noticed the way the air seems clearer and nature seems louder and livelier during lockdown. Thatrsquos not a coincidence the complete cessation of economic activities has lowered the detrimental impact on the environment.To borrow a phrase, this is an unprecedented time to explore additional ways of tackling the climate crisis.Eighteen national academies and science societies across the Commonwealth have joined forces to urge governments to address climate change and bioersity loss and, in particular, ensure global economic recovery from Covid- is environmentally sustainable. The Commonwealth academiesrsquo statement on climate change, bioersity and sustainable energy, which the Royal Society of Edinburghhas signed as Scotlandrsquos national academy, sends a call to action to heads of state to take urgent action. It warns that failure to tackle these combined challenges in the increasingly narrowing timescale required will pose signicant risk to human development and welfare, societal inequalities, and impact all Commonwealth countries and globally.Addressing climate change and bioersity loss must be a core theme on the road to recovery. We must explore the possibility of changing the way we live ndash creating a ldquonew normal ndash to develop sustainable economic growth, cheap, clean energy and better public health tackle poverty and inequality limit global warming and replace bioersity loss. We need to address dficult questions, including the impact of humans encroaching on wildle and their natural habitats, which increases the risk of viruses, like Covid-, transmitting between species.In all cases, planning and action is needed now, including further research to complete our knowledge gaps and translate research into policy. Global leadership is also required, which is present, but has not met the necessary scale of action.Key events have been delayed, including COP and COP, raising the risk that efforts to address climate change will also be delayed. More research and planning can be conducted in the meantime, but without the opportunity to meet and raty decisions, certain joint actions cannot be progressed.The RSE has established a Post-Covid- Futures Commission to support Scotland in emerging as positively as it can from the current pandemic.

And while that may seem entirely counter-intuitive as we emerge from a pandemic that has made us comply with lockdown rules and fearful of a trip to the supermarket, I believe it is essential that we make these qualities core to our education system.If the disruption caused by Covid- within our schools has given us one advantage it is that we have the opportunity to reset our education priorities. Home schooling and the likelihood of blended learning options in the future have forced a greater adoption of digital s and advanced the need for greater digital skills.Inevitably, this has highlighted the gaps in digital access that need to be addressed urgently, but it has also raised issues around how to engage all students and what skills we choose to nurture and encourage.I went to a school in Dundee that literally threw opportunities at us and for me the one experience that led to success as an adult was the chance to create my own business as part of the Young Enterprise ScotlandCompany Programme. I had a mentor and learned resilience and communication, but fundamentally it took away any mystery around the world of work.As I set out on my own business career, therefore, any fear of not being able to do something was taken away as I had already done it. I realised that I also had the capability to take strong managed risks, without which nothing would have happened.This summer, more than  Scottish school students passed the first ever YES Company Programme ldquoHigher and for me, these young people provide a blueprint for the way forward. They learn by doing and will take forward an entrepreneurial spirit that will be invaluable to Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.Moreover, the Company Programme has been shown to have disproportionately strong impacts for the most disadvantaged group of young people, because by demystying business it demonstrates to these pupils that people in top jobs are not wizards.As a measure of that success, this month sees the launch of the YES membership of Gather, a global network of JAalumni, who are still driven to share ideas and create products and services to drive profit for good. It offers a means to connect and find new sources of inspiration. It is also a timely reminder that we need to continue to be outward-looking and aspirational at a time when working lives are being put under ious constraints.As YES alumni we still have a role to play. This may be through mentoring and coaching. It may well be through supporting teachers and schools find a way to embed greater digital learning into the school curriculum. Or, perhaps, more importantly, it is by ensuring that experiential learning is not lost at a time when having the courage to be innovative and enterprising is fundamental to Scotlandrsquos path through the economic consequences of coronavirus.Enterprise is a framework to help young people think about and deal with what lies ahead, how we build this into every school day is now both a challenge and for me a priority.Chris van der Kuyl is CEO and founder of J Studios, an alumni of the Young Enterprise Scotland Company Programme and a former Chairman of the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andy-mciver-unionists-given-just-asleep","story":"Inasmuch as truth is relevant in the puerility of Scottish constitutional debate, I feel compelled to begin with my view on the matter.I am not exercised by constitutional politics. Nationality, for me, evokes contentedness, at best, rather than pride. I canrsquot get excited about which flags fly on buildings, what colour my passport is, or whether a copy of The Gruffalo is available in Scots. Indeed, I find the all-too-prevalent Scottish and British exceptionalism cringeworthy and insular, especially in those areas where we claim world-leading status when all the sensible evidence points to the contrary.Although I would have been prepared to vote Yes, I voted No in  based solely on my view that Scotlandrsquos inherited fiscal deficit combined with the leftism of a new, ideologised nation would leave me and my family poorer for a signicant period of time.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe  campaign made me feel that a Yes vote would be an act of personal self-harm a virtue signalling affirmation of non-Englishness. The stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment it was not.That said, polling trends are now clear enough to be sure that, slowly but most definitely surely, the country is moving towards independence. From the : position of , the No vote has gradually declined. Evenwe strip out polling during the pandemic, which may fairly be seen to be skewed by a seismic current event, numbers for No now normally tend to be in the low rather than the mid-fties.Since the peak of coronavirus passed, Yes has begun to build what may be seen as a psephologically consistent lead. This particular set of warning signs for unionistswere there in the polling conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC in May, in which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was given a net approval rating of % for her handling of the pandemic. Only one-in-eight people thought she was doing badly.That means, plainly, that a large number of died-in-the-wool unionists thought that Ms Sturgeon was doing a good job. As soon as I saw that poll I wondered whether unionist leaders north and south, who have long hitched their wagon to the negative perceptions of Ms Sturgeon that they claim to hear on the famous doorsteps, would understand the potential implications of their people offering her their approval, even during a crisis.The question in my head, now, is this: have the unionists given up, or are they just asleep at the wheel To be sure, positives for nationalists are plentul. Simple demographics play their part bluntly, young people are more likely to be ideological nationalists, and unionists are more likely to die. Secondly, without being pejorative about Boris Johnson, on whom the jury remains out, the very presence in Downing Street of a figure largely unpopular in Scotland also helps the case, especially when he and his partyrsquos demise still seems distant. And, thirdly, the uncertainty ushered in by Brexit, in a nation which did not vote for it, is another push factor for soft unionist Remainers.However it would also be a mistake to think that this most recent trend towards nationalism is particularly sticky. Ms Sturgeonrsquos communications around coronavirus has been as outstanding as it must have been exhausting, but her strategy has so far been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos.During a crisis, opinions are transient and often frankly hysterical. So all should not be lost for unionists. And, yet, their prospects look bleak. Bleak not because of the last two months, or even the last two years, but as a result of decades of poor strategy, guided by emotional anti-nationalism rather than calm, clinical calculation.One word sums up British unionism: ldquoreactive. The Smith Commission was a reaction to the independence referendum result. The Calman Commission was a reaction to the SNP winning in . Devolution itself was a reaction to nationalist strength.Unionism is forever chasing the curve of Scottish public opinion. It is never ahead of it. It is never proactive. If it wants to save itself, it now needs to be. If unionists think they can just say no to indyref  and eventually it will all go away, theyrsquove not been paying attention.Unionism has some strong fundamentals in its favour. Firstly, it may well be the case that at any future independence referendum voter fatigue plays a signicant role. Scots have, in six years, been asked to decide upon their future in the UK and their future in the EU, have faced three general elections and a Scottish election, with another around the corner, not to mention enduring the coronavirus crisis, during which their job has a good chance of having been saved by a UK Chancellor. They might simply think ldquoenough is enough.That is, perhaps, rather a depressing reason to vote No. But there are more uplting ones. The transfer of such large volumes of No voters to Yes over recent years means that, by definition, a large proportion of the vote is soft. It can go back under the right conditions.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeThose right conditions, I think, inevitably involve the proactive creation of a New Unionism, discussed in some quarters but not so far ostensibly embraced by anyone with their hands on the levers of power.This New Unionism would read the changing mood, not just in Scotland but also in Northern Ireland and even to a degree in Wales, and try to get ahead of it. It would almost certainly move beyond the immature unionist debate which presumes power to be binary, either shting from Westminster to Holyrood or vice versa, either a strong Scotland or a strong Britain, and instead enhance the role of both parliaments and governments through a structure built to last for decades, rather than one built to last until the next time the SNP does well at an election.When you ask two unionists how to defeat nationalism you get five dferent answers. Unless they settle on a New Unionism in short order, they will probably still be arguing with each other when the independence train leaves the station.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-stuart-waiton-keir-starmer-channels-new-mccarthyism","story":"McCarthyism was a form of terror that used unsubstantiated evidence, fear and threats to destroy potentially anyone, especially those in the entertainment industry, who were seen as left wing. The inquisitorial question, ldquoAre you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, has gone down in history as a chilling expression and reminder of the dangers of right-wing political panics.Today, we find the so-called left, in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, being sacked, McCarthy style, by Labour leader Keir Starmer, for daring to retweet a newspaper interview with the actor Maxine Peake that had in it a crass and inaccurate reference to Israeli security forces training US police to use the kneeling tactics which killed George Floyd.The irony, of course, is that this sacking does not come with rants about communist atheism, a defence of Christian mortality, ideas of treachery or the lack of loyalty to the nation. It is not a right-wing sacking but an all too familiar ldquoprogressive sacking.It is unlikely that Starmer thinks Long Bailey is actually anti-Semitic and many have suggested this is an opportunistic move on the Labour leaderrsquos behalf to clear out some of the Corbyn supporters in his shadow cabinet. The problem being, of course, that in so doing he is simply applying the modern McCarthyite approach that has been developed by the ldquoleft when dealing with those with whom they disagree.McCarthy and his ilk hated the liberal and left-wing progressives that they saw as dominating the entertainment industry, the luvvies who transgressed from American patriotism and Christian morality. Today, this too has changed, and it is often the cultural elite, the left-luvvies, who are the most ldquoright-thinking, censorious and keen to demand that people be ldquocancelled.Just ask Lawrence Fox, the actor who has been blacklisted for questioning the idea of ldquowhite privilege. Fox fears he may never get another acting job he may well be right.Until relatively recently it was only the most small-minded of bigots who thought it acceptable to sack people because of their ldquoimmoral opinions.

In any case, the really unhealthy thing about China, and the one that should alarm the West, is in the body politic.The recent actions of its government, which include the new national security law in Hong Kong, its illegal incursion and military engagement in the Galwan river valley in India, and its systematic rounding up of Uighur Muslims, more than a million of whom have been put in concentration camps in what the UN says amounts to genocide, ought to be a reminder that the despotic Communist regime remains wedded to the principle outlined by Mao Tse-Tung, that ldquopolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.In the case of Hong Kong, you could hardly get a more obvious example of the regimersquos authoritarian instincts ndash as well as a blithe disregard for the legal undertakings it gave before the handover, which promised that there would be no change in the law for at least  years, and that the territoryrsquos special status would be maintained. Instead, the new law essentially makes it a criminal offence to argue for democracy, and makes a free press impossible. Already, there has been the removal from libraries of books on liberty.It is greatly to the discredit of Western democracies that, for the past  years or so, there has been little attempt to draw attention to, let alone challenge, this repulsive dictatorship. We donrsquot seem even to be able to resist the imposition of a mobile phone network that may well be compromised by the Chinese security services, which have a stellar track record of spying on their own population and restricting their access to information.Itrsquos not just that, since the Tiananmen Square massacre of , in which thousands died, wersquove largely ignored the oppression of the Chinese people by their government after all, despite a few token protests when their president tips up, wersquove ignored the plight of illegally occupied Tibet for almost seven decades, and Taiwan, which practically no Western nationofficially recognises, and which we wonrsquot even admit to the UN in case Beijing gets huffy.Itrsquos that we appear to have convinced ourselves that, because China has embraced aspects of capitalism and become much more affluent in recent decades, that we can just forget about the fact that itrsquos still a dictatorship as tyrannical as that other Peoplersquos Republic in North Korea, which is the countryrsquos only official ally.That may have something to do with the fact that prosperity and freedom seem to be related with very few exceptionsliberty, along with property rights and the rule of law, seems to be a requirement for a sustained and successful economy. Command economies, even when they have enormous natural advantages, as Venezuela and Zimbabwe did, tend to go bust after enslaving and immiserising their citizens.And China, despite the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the worldrsquos largest number of billionaires, is not quite the economic success it might appear it may have embraced commerce ndash it is the worldrsquos largest exporter and second-largest importer ndash but not free trade. Its financial gains are slightly less stellar than its position as the worldrsquos second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the speed of its growthmight suggest, and it is certainly not evenly distributed. The middle class may now number around  million, but the country has . billion citizens, and an awful lot of debt.In per capita output, China is still a middle-income nation, ranked somewhere between th and nd , depending on how you measure it, behind such powerhouses as Gabon, Suriname and the Dominican Republic. By contrast, Macau, Hong Kong and Singapore are all in the top  by almost every estimation.In the past two decades, according to the Heritage Foundation, China has added about  trillion to its GDP, which sounds impressive. But in the same time, the United States added about  trillion to its, with a population less than one-fth the size, and with much lower levels of growth.None of this, naturally, alters the fact that, quite apart from being one of the worldrsquos oldest and greatest cultures, China is the worldrsquos most populous country, third or fourth biggest, one of its most signicant military powers and probably the only place that really rivals the US. These are all reasons why no one, and particularly not the UK, is going to start kicking the Chinese around.But it does provide some cause to question the orthodox opinion that it is about to overtake America as a superpower, that the two are in some form of new Cold War, or that it ndash as opposed to, say, India ndash is bound to dominate the next century.

restrictions on travel, and the socially distanced and virtual ways of working for the foreseeable future may have catastrophic funding implications.Our universities are world-renowned, and attract students from around the globe to come to live and study in Scotland.This has been a great strength, and the international student tuition fee income has become vital to enable universities to deliver the teaching, knowledge exchange and research they do so successfully, particularly when teaching budgets have been underfunded for some time.The pandemic and the emergency measures required bring so much uncertainty as to whether new students from Scotland, the rest of the UK, and the wider world, will turn up in September for the new academic year.These studentsrsquo decisions have financial implications for institutions, as to whether those who pay tuition fees will be bringing that income to universities this year.Forecasts y, with estimates ranging between a pound million loss of income for the sector at the lower end, to the Scottish Funding Councilrsquos worst-case scenario estimate of an operating deficit of poundm in  . Whatever the reality, our universities need help to get through the coming period, not least because they are the drivers of economic growth, andso many are vital employers and stakeholders in their local economies.UCUrsquos research carried out at the start of the crisis by London Economics estimated a  per cent decrease inthe number of international students coming to Scotland, meaningjust under , fewer first-year international student enrolmentsin the coming academic year. The London Economics report estimates that this, along with the other effects of the current crisis, will lead to apoundm financial hole in the sector for the year  .We know universities are already taking steps to make cuts. This includes not renewing the army of fixed term and hourly paid staff who deliver vital teaching and tutoring to undergraduates. Staff are being asked to endure pay and increment freezes, as well as other reductions to their terms and conditions.A number of universities are also contemplating signicant job losses. UCU will always look to protect jobs and vigorously oppose compulsory redundancies. :Scottish universities at risk of being wiped out by Covid- crisis , experts warnThe perilous financial situation is why we launched our Fund The Future campaign calling on government to support universities through this dficult time.But this is more than simply a trade union looking to protect its membersrsquo jobs. Universities are not seeking special treatment or additional funding simply for the sake of it. Rather we need to protect the sector because universities have an essential role in driving the country out of crisis.First, and probably of most importance at the present, is the specic role of higher education in fighting the virus, providing labs for research and testing, finding possible cures and treatment for those infected and developing vaccines, protective equipment, and other public health strategies. Similarly, it is many of our universities that are educating the nursing staff, health care professionals, doctors and consultants who work in the NHS day in and day out. The inspirational reports of nurses and doctors leaving their studies earlyto join the fight against Covid-and save lives is testament both to their personal dedication, but alsoto the staff in our universities who have equipped them for the job they now do.Equally important is the role that universities play in their communities. Universities are major employers in their town or city and offer decent, skilled employment that bringspeople to live and contribute to local economies.University research, and the critical thinking graduates they produce, helps us to understand the world in which we live. At a time where fake news, misinformation and polarisation is re, we should be valuing the role of universities to inform, educate and empower.The final element of why government help is required is that higher education is a key driver of economic recovery as the country comes out of the current crisis. From nurturing entrepreneurial skills, spin-off companies and SMEs, research and development, and a supply of highly skilled graduates entering the jobs market, universities are a key player in building the economy back from the coronavirus recession. Simply put, there is no road to recovery that does not involve a well-resourced higher education sector.We welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos poundmillion of new money for research in universities along with its commitment to maintaining free tuition.Research carried out among Scottish domiciled university applicants for UCU has shown that their attitudes towards deferral, and in some cases, going into higher education at all, is substantially dependant on not having to pay tuition fees.The UK Governmentrsquos support to the sector thus far has been to bring forward money for research, offer loans and suggest it will bail out institutions on the brink of failure. This response is underwhelming and fails to acknowledge the key role higher education plays in our economy and society.The shortfallin teaching funding in universities in Scotland has not yet been addressed, and will be exacerbated by any loss of international student fee income.  We need a support package from both Scottish and UK governments that properly underwrite the sector and secures the future for our institutions and the staff and students who make them world class.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

She is currently volunteering with Skye Community Response and helping to fundraise for the Centre of Resilience in Bihar in India, among other projects.Layla worked with the directors of the Centre of Resilience # Kumar Prashant and Benjamin Reid-Howells # last summer and spent three months in India last winter.During that time she visited the centre which is in the fourth poorest state in India, Bihar.Bihar was historically the educational epicentre of India, however, it suffers from floods and droughts, cases of extreme poverty, and wide-spread disease # but people, like Kumar Prashant, are working tirelessly to elevate this state out of poverty.Kumar Prashant travelled with his friend Ben from India to Scotland by motorcycle helping multiple humanitarian initiatives along the way. The motorcycle journey took them  years.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Just some of the hair mishaps stylists will have to tackle after over  days of closure. On Monday, normally a day of rest for the hair and beauty industry, the latest easing of restrictions meant demand for a post-lockdown top-to-toe transformation was sky high. And judging by the volume of phone calls and messages from clients scrambling to get an appointment, salons are set for a busy few weeks.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadStephen Hamilton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadAs well as hairdressers and barbers, beauty salons and tattoo parlours were also back in business. Belfast#s Lisburn Road was a hive of activity as men seeking urgent restyles queued up outside the numerous barber shops dotted across both sides of the thoroughfare. Despite cups of coffee and glossy magazines being out, and facemasks, hand sanitiser and Perspex screens in, salons have been booked out weeks in advance.At Andrew Watson Hairdressing, Una Calvert from east Belfast was sitting comfortably in front of the mirror for her first cut and colour since January. You have no idea how long I#ve waited for this day. I have been tempted to put all sorts of things in my hair but I#ve stayed away from home dye, she said. Apart from trimming my fringe, I leave it all to the experts. Once I heard when salons could reopen I was straight on the phone to Andrew and I#m so delighted to be here on the first day back.As a long-time client Una said she had absolutely no qualms about coming back in.

Six days later, his body was discovered in a storm drain close to where he went missing.While police say they have no reason to suspect foul play in the -year-old St Malachy’s College pupil’s death, speculation has continued on social media.The family, including mum Fiona, said: “We recognise the huge public concern of the entire population and we thank each and every one of you. So many people have been incredibly generous to us with practical support.Read More In his own words: A letter to Noah Donohoe from dad Emmanuel“This support includes providing pieces of information regarding Noah’s disappearance and death. Separately, some have also ventilated concerns on social media s.“At this time, we are working with the PSNI on matters which are outstanding to the investigation and we are seeking answers to questions which arise. Noah’s disappearance and death undoubtedly raise questions however public speculation and theory is unhelpful. We are dealing with the facts. We have seen a number of social media accounts which have been founded under Noah’s name seeking further information. These accounts do not have the family’s permission.“Rather than ventilating any issue on social media s, we urge anyone with information regarding Noah’s disappearance and death to forward this information, including any photographic CCTV footage to the PSNI or to Relatives for Justice  email: info@relativesforjustice .“All information will be dealt with in strictest confidence.”The family said they were are also represented by solicitor Niall Murphy of KRW Law.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metNurse reports Sinn Fein MLAs to police over Storey funeral as Stormont parties to unite to demand apologyFor sale!

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappShawn Keeleyfrom Dungiven celebrates becoming Northern Irelands latest National Lottery millionaire.Gillian HallidayJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA CO Londonderry store manager has become Northern Ireland’s latest millionaire after scooping an incredible £m on a scratchcard.Shawn Keeleyfrom Dungiven bought the winning ‘£M Mega Cash Showdown’ scratchcard at McNicholl’s Eurospar on Station Road, Dungiven, the store that he manages. A finance graduate from Jordanstown, Shawn now has a few decisions to make on how to handle his new-found fortune after his Saturday night turned into something far beyond his wildest dreams.“It all started when I bought a couple of £ scratchcards on the Friday night,” explained Shawn. “I won £ on those so, as I was leaving work around .pm on Saturday evening, I bought a couple of £ scratchcards with my winnings.“Normally I’d scratch them in the car but on this occasion, I took them home with me as I had to get ready to go to a socially distanced garden party with a few friends that night. I actually forgot about the scratchcards in my jacket pocket so when I got home, I had a shower and got ready to go out.“Then I remembered the cards, took them out of my jacket and started scratching around pm. All of a sudden, I could see that my numbers matched and the card was telling me that I had won the top prize of one million pounds.“I really couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was still trying to process what was happening while my mum was already making plans for a new asphalt driveway at the front of the house, which they’ve been working on. “Then she phoned my brother Paul in England and I texted my brother Gavin in Australia – both of whom naturally thought we were joking,” he laughed.Shawn was soon brought back down to earth when, having just become a millionaire, he received a phone call from the store assistant who had earlier sold him the winning scratchcard.“The call came through and immediately I thought this was it – I’d been the victim of an elaborate prank,” said Shawn. “But it turned out there was just a problem with the fridge in the shop so I had to go round and fix it, knowing that I’d literally just won a million. That was around .pm which meant I was running very late to meet my friends.“When I arrived, my friends asked… ‘you’re late, what happened to you ’“I replied ‘nothing much, I just won a million quid on a scratchcard’ and then the party really got under way!” Despite his big win, Shawn will continue working at the store as he loves his job and has a ‘great relationship’ with the owners. He now plans to treat his family, adding the local community has been very supportive since news started to leak about his big win.“It’s been really nice as customers have been coming into the shop and saying that they’re delighted for me and that it couldn’t have happened to a nicer family,” he said.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metNurse reports Sinn Fein MLAs to police over Storey funeral as Stormont parties to unite to demand apologyFor sale!

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

Public church services resumed this week in the latest easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Pubs and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on Friday. Speaking at Mass today at St Eugenes Cathedral, the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said there was still confusion in relation to some religious services. “This last week, I have been trying to work out whether the NI Executive has now given us permission to baptise,” said Bishop McKeown. “I know that it sounds ridiculous that Churches have to get political clearance to baptise a baby or an adult! googletag.cmd.push “Of course, I can understand the thinking behind the earlier temporary baptism ban because, for some, sacramental events seem to refer to the large parties afterwards. “Now we can have the baptism parties – but I am unclear whether we can actually have the baptism before the party!” Bishop McKeown said he was not sure whether the legal restrictions have changed or whether people still waiting for further clarication. “When politicians accuse others of not understanding government messages, that might suggest a lack of clarity in the messaging rather than merely culpable deafness on the part of the listeners,” he added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

It was revealed recently that just over % of all vehicles using the Pennyburn dump in Derry are from the Republic. Concern had been raised that local ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. googletag.cmd.push The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed yesterday at a special meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a working group be set up to look at the issue of vehicles from the Republic using the local recycling centres. This was backed by all other parties on the council apart from Sinn Fein. In a report prepared for yesterdays meeting, it was stated that additional staff would be neededthe council was to monitor vehicles using the recycling centres. The report stated: More recently Members asked that officers consider the implications of a policy that restricts access to recycling sites to those that reside within the Council area only. This would place an additional resource burden on the service in that staff will have to check the residency details of all those entering sites right across the district. Several of the sites operate with a single member of staff, who needs to supervise the disposal of materials and assist those using the site, therefore additional staff would be required at these facilities to ensure compliance.

As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

The former linen warehouse on the Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complexBelfast City Council has long had a contradictory attitude to the city’s built heritage.It boasts that Belfast’s streetscape is “a veritable storybook to rival any city in the UK or Ireland” while simultaneously allowing the removal of numerous pages through its support for developer-led regeneration.The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to the type of clash between heritage and commerce now faced by the council in relation to former Ulster Televisionheadquarters at Havelock House.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...An exterior picture of Havelock House, UTV, in , six years after the first broadcast from the studio there in Halloween The former linen warehouse on Belfast’s Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complex. The proposal from Olympian Homes is highly likely to succeed because the failings of our planning system have allowed the developer and the council to maintain the legal fiction that the building has no heritage value.This position isn’t even remotely credible, given Havelock House’s integral role in the birth of Northern Ireland’s television industry, its indelible association with legendary local series such as Teatime with Tommy, Romper Room, Good Evening Ulster and Kelly and its status as the last surviving small station from the pioneering days of UK television.Features such as the original UTV studio, designed by local architect Brian Hewitt, are literally the nation’s last built record of the earliest days of television in regions such as Northern Ireland.The Queen meets UTV broadcasters including Paul Clarke during her visit to Havelock House as they launch their new HD station there in . Pic Colm Lenaghan PacemakerBut, despite its clear historical importance, nobody seems willing to protect a building which occupies a prime development site.There are two forms of protection available: full listed status, which can only be granted by the Department for Communities , and heritage asset status, which could be granted by Belfast City Council.The DfC has decided that Havelock House does not meet the criteria for a listing survey, the first step in the listing process. It reached this decision on the basis of a brief inspection of the building by officials in . Studio  inside Havelock House in the s with guests including Frank Carson, Gloria Hunnord and Rev David BurkeThe rationale behind its decision was never fully recorded. The fragments available suggest that the officials were not familiar with television architecture, leading them to make several inadvertent but decisive misinterpretations. The DfC has been aware of this issue for  months yet has remains unwilling to review its decision.Eventhere were a review, it is unlikely the DfC’s decision will change because its listing criteria are dominated by aesthetic considerations. This is exemplied by the protected status of the BBC’s Broadcasting House, which is an attractive building devoid of internal historical fabric. Dr Ken Grfin, a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster TelevisionBy contrast, the DfC seems relaxed about the possible loss of Havelock House, a less attractive building with unique historical architecture.The absence of listed building status isn’t necessarily an issue because local authorities can designate heritage assets, buildings which don’t meet the national listing criteria but should still be protected on cultural and historical grounds.This author has been unable to find any instance where Belfast City Council has used this power. It’s also unlikely to do so in the future because its current draft development plan indicates that only listed buildings qualy as heritage assets, which defeats the purpose of that designation.The authorities’ inaction has not just left Havelock House exposed to demolition but it has reduced the public’s ability to scrutinise Olympian Homes’ demolition proposal. Without protection, the developers and Belfast’s planners have been able to maintain the fiction that Havelock House is a building devoid of historical value. This has allowed Olympian to submit a heritage statement which does not consider the historical or cultural impact of the building’s demolition. This is entirely legitimate as such statements are not required to disclose a development’s impact on unprotected structures.It has also allowed the developers to avoid the type of public consultation normally triggered by planning applications which entail the demolition of historically signicant buildings. Due to Havelock House’s unlisted status, Olympian could conduct a minimalistic consultation. It is impossible to assess the nature of Olympian’s consultation because the developer seems to have omitted its consultation report from its planning application. But it seems to have been poorly advertised – this author only became aware of the proposal by accident while, despite the development’s size, only a handful of objections have been received by the council to date.The developer’s decision to name its development ‘Havelock House’ in spite of the intended demolition of the eponymous building also seems to have sown confusion. My personal experience is that many people assume that the historic television station would be retained as part of the development.The affair of Havelock House might seem extraordinary but the sad fact is that such scenarios are not uncommon in our planning system.This has had a corrosive impact on public faith in the planning system: last month, a survey by Queen’s University found that % of people believe that Northern Ireland’s planning system does not serve the public interest.Barring a miracle, events on Belfast’s Ormeau Road are likely to only reinforce this view.• Dr Ken Grfin is a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster Television.

unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added: \"Everyone has a responsibility in keeping themselves and others safe until this pandemic is over.\"We do not know when that happen, but it certainly will not be in the short-term.\"Until then, take care of yourself, do not put others at risk and stop the increase of the R number in our community.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene.
