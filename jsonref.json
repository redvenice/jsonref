This quickly descended into violence, with fights between the rival groups as the police tried to disperse the crowds for a 5pm curfew. Their were also protests in cities including Liverpool, Newcastle, Brighton and Glasgow as BLM activists - spurred on by the removal of 18th Century slave dealer Robert Milligan from outside the Museum of London in West India Quay. The addition of Sir Arthur Harris to the list of targets is likely to provoke further debate. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8aa4fc6c1f648498a5f3200f5e737d10fa2e09/0_1643_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9372187c883924c132b2a7c880571226","title":"thomas hoepker early images in pictures magnum","story":"Thomas Hoepker has been a Magnum photographer for nearly 60 years.

Lenders and regulators, and the government and the British Business Bank as the authorities standing behind the loans, will need to apply a shared understanding of how to treat borrowers in difficulty,” he said.The FCA boss said lenders would need to scale up their debt arrears teams quickly and invest in the right training and control. An appropriate dispute resolution system would also need to be ready to handle a potential spike in complaints.“We can’t allow this to become a replay of the 2008 crisis where the treatment of some small business borrowers did such serious damage to people and to trust in financial services,” Randall warned.Figures released by the Treasury on Tuesday showed that lenders have so far approved £38.2bn worth of government-guaranteed loans to 913,110 UK businesses since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.But there are fears that small and medium-sized businesses will be shouldering £97bn to £107bn of unsustainable debt by March 2021 as a result of the pandemic. The City taskforce which put together those projections said a third of that total would come from government-backed loans.One banking executive told the  that he was preparing to shift significant resources – including hundreds of staff – by October in order to deal with a surge in business customers struggling to repay their debts.That is when repayment holidays – granted for up to six months – will come to an end, just as government support for employee wages through the coronavirus job retention scheme is expected to wind down.“We don’t want to find ourselves in the same position we did in March, where literally within 10 days, all of a sudden there was this huge tsunami of demand as the government launched what was initially the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, very, very, very quickly,” the executive said.“It’s a bit like the government’s mantra of trying to get ahead of the curve. We’re just trying to do the same thing.”The banking boss said his team had set “severity ratings” for thousands of customers most at risk of a cash crunch, and was preparing experts to handle firms from the hard-hit sectors like leisure, travel and tourism, hospitality and entertainment. “We’re putting all our time and attention into getting teams talking to clients about getting ready for the next few months,” he said.A second wave of businesses struggling to service their debt is expected to emerge in spring 2021, when small and medium sized businesses will have to start repaying government-backed loans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84b7fb8d8abddfd69c867036a6cdf7548a037c9/0_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01d1793021ff3ba550f8518ce154a37","title":"germany vietnam test trace england coronavirus","story":"The government was shown how to contain coronavirus – but chose to prioritise centralised control and private interestsMost people agree that England’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has been slow and disorganised a fact made worse by the government’s willingness to squander public trust by massaging data and spinning the facts to save face. Yet its shambolic approach to testing and contact tracing isn’t the result of mistakes, but a choice to ignore evidence and experience.For months, public health specialists in England have asked the government to decentralise responsibility for testing and tracing to local authority public health teams, which can develop nimble and responsive plans that are specific to different contexts, and organise systems with clear lines of accountability. They have also asked the government to recognise the obvious fact that case detection and contact tracing are social and behavioural interventions, which rely on skilled personnel and trust.Testing is particularly important with coronavirus, because many people have mild or no symptoms. Actively detecting new cases through testing also allows public health authorities to visibly demonstrate the importance of vigilance, and provides an opportunity for frontline health workers to engage with communities. Ideally you want to target communities or population groups who are at risk of either getting a severe infection, or transmitting the virus to others.You also need a well-trained workforce, able to engage with people on a human-to-human basis, with some epidemiological and clinical knowledge. Because testing results aren’t always correct and can be delayed, sometimes a presumptive clinical diagnosis – of the sort a trained health worker can provide – is necessary. And when a case has been identified, information needs to be carefully gathered and assessed to determine the likely period of infectiousness, identify high-risk contacts (those who have had close and prolonged interaction, especially in a confined indoor space) and then formulate a tracing plan. Conversations need to be empathic and culturally sensitive, and conducted in the right language.Given that we still face months of potential chaos and damage, we have to understand why the government keeps ignoring well-established principles of good practice, and why it is willing to hand over contracts to companies such as Serco rather than involving local public health systems from the outset. This is not a case of mistakes being made. Instead, the government’s contact tracing shambles suggests something more troubling: a disdain for evidence, an obsession with centralised control, and the privileging of private over public interests.• David McCoy is a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d3494a3fabb02480d1b4b409a965cc2dc803a7/0_92_3784_2272/master/3784.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=d05bdb41276738a8aa2433ba19b61239","title":"parents schools tough choice government","story":"So many blunders. But the risk to children’s wellbeing from keeping them at home is greater than the risk of being in class“A massive catch-up operation,” Boris Johnson said. Whatever he meant is due to be announced this week for the nine million children who are on course to lose getting on for half a year’s schooling. Will it be another fatuous over-promise? Something enormous is needed to repair the damage.The cabinet is tussling over relaxing social distancing to 1 metre. If earning public trust is key to opening up, those pushing for the cut are unlikely to reassure a nervous public. They are not pleading the cause of children, but agitating for pubs and restaurants. In the difficult decisions to ease the lockdown rules, estate agents, car showrooms, house cleaners, nannies, zoos and shops came first.The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is calling loudly for schools to fully open now, and for a children’s catch-up plan lasting a year, with a generous pupil premium. Closure, she says, denies the fundamental right to education.Longfield has been vocal about all that has been stripped from children in the past decade: as a founder of some of the best children’s centres, she was distraught at their destruction. She once took me to her Braintree Sure Start, back in New Labour’s heyday, proud of its remarkable nursery and family hub, with every professional help on hand, its cafe run by young people with disabilities, and a youth unit for excluded children. “Most centres have gone, or have very little left going on,” she says.These decisions are fiendish: politicians weigh up the risk of disease versus the certainty of personal, economic and social calamities. But taking cautious steps, schools are not only the most important places to open, but one of the safer places. Children are at very low risk from coronavirus. And, according to studies in seven countries, teachers are at the same risk as the general population.David Spiegelhalter is the Winton professor of public understanding of risk at Cambridge University. His discipline needs close public attention. Most of us are bad at assessing risk, irrationally fearing the wrong things, gambling on faulty perceptions, emotionally swayed. In the great miasma of facts, factoids and misinformation, with serious scientists disagreeing, how are parents to weigh up the odds? No wonder most have opted to keep children at home.At first people trusted government instruction. But no longer. Johnson and his ministers’ dishonesty with figures – they were even rebuked by the chief statistician – has left people all at sea. Testing and contact tracing, crucial to opening up, have been badly undermined by excessive boasts and lies about targets. But, for all the blunders, things are improving. The risk to children’s wellbeing from keeping schools shut looks far greater than the risk of opening the gates.What has Gavin Williamson’s education department been doing these 12 long weeks? The simplest tasks are beyond its grasp, failing to send free school meals vouchers, leaving families hungry for weeks. Despite a grand announcement it has still failed to get laptops to 200,000 children lacking them, exposing years of exclusion when so much homework requires the internet.“We’ve had no laptops, not one,” says Nicola Noble, co-head of Surrey Square primary in south London’s Aylesbury estate: she’s relying on donations. She has desperate parents and children standing outside school using its wifi, as they can’t afford data. A quarter of the school’s families have no internet.“But we’ve had 90-page Department for Education guidances that essentially leave all responsibility to us. Nothing useful,” she says. Noble had to spend hours Googling for a risk assessment process for staff and students, and days working out a wellbeing survey for the children, because it was not provided centrally. “They only told us their definition of vulnerable and key worker the night before admitting those children,” so they had to call all parents to ask what job they did, and everywhere only a fraction of the vulnerable children were actually sent to school. “They said 180 of our 500 children with social workers were vulnerable, but we’ve found it’s 243. We call every child every week, which should be guidance, but it’s not. They sent no script to help teachers talk to children about coronavirus: it took us hours, now dozens of schools use ours.”Food and wellbeing have preoccupied her staff, as many families have “no recourse to public funds”, left penniless once they lost their jobs. The school delivers food parcels to 128 families.Waiting for Johnson’s “big summer of catch-up”, she is ready to open up fully as soon as possible. “We could do anything – and we can’t close for summer holidays.” But schools are barred from going a penny over budget. “Just give us the money to hire spaces and support staff. Let us give out free breakfasts and lunches. Our children need to be back here.” As for distancing, she’ll try, but “frankly, they won’t”. That’s the honest risk, but one she wants to take.Yet again, why so late in the day? Why so little thought or planning? There has been no consultation with schools, nor with the children’s commissioner. Longfield wrote to the chancellor last week: “If we can have business recovery plans, we need a children’s recovery plan. But no money has been put forward.”Whatever this government’s ideological deformities, what continues to astonish is its staggering lack of ability to deliver anything, to learn from its mistakes – or to just plain govern.The decision for parents to make about sending their children back to schools was always going to be hard. But this government has made it doubly difficult."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8cb6d3b1c2590cf4d0400aeea7a5fab7173a18/0_100_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d2618fa52ba15980f2c69690eb43267","title":"record unemployment uk government ons figures labour market","story":"New ONS figures show how coronavirus has crippled the labour market. There are ways to help – but urgent action is neededThe figures released on Tuesday morning by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) paint a bleak picture of the state of the labour market. After Friday’s news that we are on course for the largest recession in three centuries, today we have learned that the number of people unemployed and claiming benefits is rising faster than at any point in our history. Three key things stand out from the data.First, claimant unemployment – a measure of all of those who are unemployed and claiming social security benefits – has risen by 1.6 million in two months, to 2.8 million. This is the highest level since 1993, 1.2 million higher than the last recession and the largest increase since unemployment benefits were created nearly 100 years ago. Even in the first year of the Great Depression, unemployment only rose by one million. Furthermore, we estimate that based on applications for benefits in May, claimant unemployment likely stands at about 3.1 million as of 9 June – probably beating the previous highest ever level, set in 1986.Rising unemployment has also been accompanied by a collapse in job vacancies – from about 800,000 before the coronavirus crisis to just 320,000 in the single-month estimate for May. Putting this together with the unemployment data, this means that there are now 8.5 unemployed people competing for every job opening, compared with just 1.5 before this crisis began. This picture also varies hugely across the country – with our analysis of online job adverts for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggesting that in many ex-industrial, inner city and coastal areas the picture is far worse.The ONS suggests that part of the difference between the survey measures and the claimant measure may be explained by people who are working a small number of hours but who have applied for universal credit and are being counted as unemployed. Undoubtedly this explains part of the difference. However, “real time” tax data also published on Tuesday suggests that the number of employees has fallen by 600,000 between March and May – which, added to the fall in self-employment, would mean at least a million more people out of work in May than in March.All told, with at least a million more people out of work and nine million workers furloughed through the job retention scheme, it is likely that right now less than half of the working-age population are actually working.So what will the next few months hold? In some respects, today’s data has added to the uncertainty around what is actually going on in the labour market. I think that we can say for sure that next month we will be reporting that claimant unemployment has passed three million and may well be at its highest ever level. I also think that the LFS data will start to catch up with this claimant data and will start rising towards three million in the coming months.Looking further ahead, new claims for universal credit appear to have fallen back to close to pre-crisis levels, while data that we will publish on Friday will show that the number of new vacancies has doubled in the last fortnight (albeit from a very low base). Both of these are positive signs.However, unless people are confident to start spending again, and businesses are able to reopen, then there is a very real risk that a “second wave” of unemployment could hit us as the job retention scheme starts to unwind. This could push unemployment up by at least a further two million, and see it rising inexorably towards four or even five million by the end of year. As with everything in this crisis, all roads lead back to successfully suppressing the virus.In the meantime though, we need to act now to deal with this jobs crisis. As we at the Institute for Employment Studies set out over the weekend with over more than business leaders, politicians and charities, we think that this response needs three parts. First, an urgent and temporary stimulus to kick-start hiring and support job retention over the summer, ideally by cutting employer national insurance. Second, a doubling of the size of our employment services, so that everyone gets the help that they need to find new work. And finally, investment now so that we are ready for record long-term unemployment next year – and in particular so that we can guarantee that all young unemployed people will have the opportunity of an education place, apprenticeship or job.• Tony Wilson is director of the Institute for Employment Studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce07a2fe738399bc6e256c1f6a63ca398a10a74/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdee35f5170171752352a7e7f7928776","title":"tell us are you helping uk school children get free meals","story":"We’d like to hear from local initiatives helping to feed disadvantaged children struggling to access free school mealsMarcus Rashford has put pressure on the government to extend its free school meals voucher system for low-income families over the summer holiday period.The footballer’s call – rejected by the prime minister – comes after the scheme in England was extended over the Easter holiday to ensure the 1.3 million children entitled to the free meals did not go hungry during the coronavirus crisis.But the scheme has been beset with problems while many schools remain closed to most pupils, sometimes leaving local initiatives to plug the gaps.Have you helped children get free meals during the lockdown?

The lawyers, acting for Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project, say this potential risk to life means ministers must act even if the evidence is not yet conclusive.The letter adds to pressure on the government from 90 parliamentarians who on Friday backed action on air pollution to help avoid a second coronavirus peak. Meanwhile, a new air pollution inquiry by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs select committee will examine delays in the rollout of clean air zones in cities as a result of the pandemic.The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups was recently called “astonishing” and “wholly irresponsible” by critics of a Public Health England review.Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “When there is a risk of harm to human life, the government must take measures to alleviate that risk. With evidence piling up that links dirty air with cases of Covid-19, it is the government’s legal duty to conduct an urgent review. The government says they are listening to science. They must prove it.”Jemima Hartshorn, from the campaign group Mums for Lungs, said: “Air pollution is linked to cancer, respiratory illnesses, stunted lung growth, diabetes, cardiac diseases, strokes and many other diseases. In the midst of a respiratory pandemic, the government has to finally take the necessary action to ensure clean air for all.”“Whilst this firm and our clients are sympathetic to the pressures facing government at this time, these matters are necessarily urgent in light of the likelihood of further ‘waves’ of the Covid-19 pandemic,” they said. “The longer the government delays this review, the longer this generation and the next will suffer from the impacts of Covid-19.”The letter notes that in May Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said the link between air pollution and coronavirus was “entirely plausible”, and that the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said dirty air “remains a hidden killer”. It also notes that the health minister Lord Bethell has acknowledged evidence that inhaling pollution particles might “increase the spread or severity of Covid-19”.The lawyers have asked Eustice to commit to a review by 23 June and publish it within three months. If the government refuses, Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project will consider further legal action.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We remain committed to being a world leader in tackling air pollution. As we rebuild our economy in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we will continue to shape a cleaner, greener and more resilient society.”Neil Parish, the chair of the environment select committee, said: “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, air pollution was vastly overlooked. The pandemic is threatening to push back some of the crucial work planned for addressing poor air quality, when it is clear that it should instead be a once-in-a-lifetime catalyst for action.”The Hausfeld letter to Eustice is also backed by the Students for Global Health group. Its director, Harpreet Kaur, said: “A green recovery is vital to tackling the hidden crisis of air pollution. It is important we move on this quickly to ensure a healthy environment for current and future generations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c459c3ed7d0fcf3f365dd192ed56ec613fa525/1_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f25f97aef5ddbe2c07b383ee4654a07f","title":"my lockdown spring watch a photo essay","story":" sports photographer  Tom Jenkins follows up his popular take on tulips during the enforced break from action photography.

I was pleasantly surprised by the response, with far more people getting in touch than I’ve ever had for a sports story.\u0026nbspThe tulips died down, but sport was nowhere near a return. I needed something else and, fortunately, nature handed me another gift, a project that would test my photographic skills and give me the adrenaline buzz that I desperately missed from my normal job.Just as lockdown had fully kicked in around my north London home, I couldn’t help but notice two tiny birds flitting around my front garden.

I knew robins, mainly because of Christmas cards, and other birds because they were nicknames of football teams – magpies, eagles, seagulls, canaries, etc. Every year I go with my family to the wildlife photography exhibition at the Natural History Museum and marvel at the pictures, amazed by the skill, technique and patience needed to create such beautiful images. Did it make me want to do similar? Not really, sport was my thing and I was happy with that.But these little birds kept grabbing my attention. We soon realised a nest was being built in the rose bush growing beside our front door. I had no idea what these birds were called, needing an uncle to identify them as long-tailed tits, Britain’s lightest bird and known as bum barrels. “You lucky things!” he said. These two were near-identical cute fluff balls with mainly black and white plumage tinged with bits of grey and pink. Only later, under close inspection of the photos, did I realise one had an orange eyeball, the other had yellow. They went everywhere together I read that long-tailed tits often went round in large groups as an extended family but these two were by themselves. I decided I might as well follow them, seeing if I could get a decent frame or two. This was my chance to be a bird photographer, at least for a while.At first it was really frustrating – I would see them on a branch but before I could focus they were off. They were so quick and seemed nervous of me. As for getting them in mid-air, their undulating and erratic flight seemed impossible to capture. I needed another approach: rather than chasing them around, I realised I had to be in place first and let them come to me. I began to learn their patterns of behaviour, noting routes they flew and places they visited. It reminded me of an approach I use in sports photography, getting to know “the hot zones”, areas where most action happens and the chance of success is greater. With these birds it tended to be near the rose bush, as they would always return there for nest building.To improve my chances of a better picture, I researched the birds expanding my knowledge of them could help me work out what they were doing. As I learnt more about the birds I got closer to them. I started to get some half-decent images but all were of them sitting neatly on a branch or bush. I needed something a little more exciting and challenging, to show their character. Luckily for me they decided to provide exactly what I needed.For about three weeks during their nest building they would have sudden mood changes. Most of the time, when perched, they looked calm and cute, but then, out of the blue, they would become aggressive. They began flying into my front windows, repeatedly hitting the glass. I’d never seen anything like this before and no other birds were doing it. I guessed they must have been confused by the reflections off the glass, attacking the mirror image of themselves, thinking it was a rival bird threatening their new nest. I know it might sound a little cruel but I found it fascinating – and not bad for pictures.This behaviour could happen at any time during the day. We could be watching television when there’d be a tap, tap, tap on the window – the angry birds. Sitting in my armchair I’d have a perfect view of the TV and the front window. There could be someone having their arm ripped off on the show Tiger King but my gaze was fixed elsewhere.Some days were much quieter. I’d be sitting, poised with camera, waiting for the birds, but nothing. That didn’t seem too bad if I was inside but I would also sit outside, tucked away behind my bins in a basic attempt to disguise myself, getting some very strange looks from passers-by, obviously questioning my mental well-being. The hours would pass, time enough for me to wonder myself about own sanity, then suddenly there would be a flurry of action. It reminded me of being at a cricket match, waiting ages for something to happen, then boom, drama all over in a flash.The birds seemed to have their favourite spots. Stretching across the street are a couple of old telephone wires, which they loved sitting on and bouncing in between. It gave them a perfect view down to the nest below and no other bird used them. It was part playground, part lookout, part bathroom and all theirs. Frequently, as the last rays of the setting sun hit the wires, the birds would wash themselves and dry off there.Looking at the nest it was easy to see why the long-tailed tit has been called the structural engineer of the bird world. These two put together an amazing rugby-ball shaped construction with a small entrance hole about three-quarters of the way up. It was built from hair, moss, cobwebs and lichen but, most ingeniously of all, with silk from spider cocoons which made the nest elastic and stretchy, so when it was full of growing chicks it could expand with them. Once the outside was made the two birds set about finding a stash of feathers – up to 2,000 can be used – to line the inside, making it soft for the eggs to be laid.When the nest was done the constant flying ceased. I presumed the eggs were laid as one bird would often stay behind, probably incubating, while the other found food. We loved it when we could see the bird’s head poking out of the nest entrance, watching the world go by. This pattern continued for quite a few days until I sensed something else was happening. I saw one of the birds with food in its mouth heading into the rose bush – a sure sign. Perched on top of a ladder I found a great view, in between branches straight through to the nest entrance which had a large pigeon feather pulled across, shielding the contents inside. The parent completely ignored me and poked its head inside – a tiny beak appeared.From then on, growth for the chicks was rapid, fuelled by the endless food shuttles the parents were doing. Backwards and forwards they flew, laden with various insects and grubs. The chicks quickly lost their reptilian looks, gaining feathers and fluffing up. The distinctive white line of the long-tailed tit on their heads, like they had tiny Mohican haircuts. It may be a stereotypical scene, seen countless times on television, thrusting beaks of egg-yolk yellow, eager to grab food from a parent, but it still gave me goosebumps witnessing it right there in front of me.The chicks would desperately try to force themselves forward to the very edge of the entrance hole, hoping to be first in line for grub. This jostling of positions would often end up in squabbling and bickering – it struck a familiar chord with me. In between the regular feeds they would sleep, some with necks hanging right out of the nest, not wanting to lose their hard-earned priority position.Unsure of exactly when the first chicks were born, I had to guess the day they might start leaving the nest. Fledging time was approaching. One day I looked out and saw the first chick had ventured from the nest and on to surrounding branches. After about 20 minutes of washing itself and wobbling around, very unsure on its feet, it decided that was enough and headed back inside the nest. The next day I went out very early. Looking down to the ground I saw two chicks had tumbled eight feet from the nest down to the concrete pavingOne was already dead, the other looked battered, shaken and groggy – a heart-breaking sight. We scooped up the injured one in a tiny bowl and placed it back in the rose bush. It was ignored by both parents – the question was, did these two chicks fall or were they pushed? Perhaps the nest got overloaded and they were forced out? I also started to think about my role. Should I be trying to save this chick? Was I interfering with nature? It’s obviously a frequent dilemma faced by many recording the natural world. The injured and scorned one fell out of the rose bush another couple of times, each time we scooped it up and placed it back. After the fourth fall we had to make the decision to leave it to die. I was gutted. Another chick emerged from the nest and briefly wobbled around. Whether or not it saw its sibling lying on the paving below I can’t be sure, but it soon decided freedom was overrated and returned inside.The next morning, whilst eating breakfast, I heard a commotion from the nest, one much louder than the usual arguments. Going out I couldn’t believe it – the sweetest chicks you could ever imagine emerging from the nest and perched in the branches of the rose bush, seven in total. A mass wash and unfurling of feathers was happening, the chattering noise incredible. Gradually they found their balance and bravery, wandering around before, one by one, they summoned up the courage to take their maiden flights, in this case around three feet over to the privet hedge. Some just about made it, some fell short landing on a dustbin, window-box or dwarf Christmas tree. One landed on my camera. Somehow they all managed to meet up in the privet hedge, where they began to mimic being back in the nest, squeezing together in a bundle of fluff and feather.That first night out they went to sleep, seven in a row, packed tightly on a branch in the privet hedge. But the next morning, they had gone. I looked for ominous signs, like loose feathers, fearful that a cat or fox had found them. Thankfully there were none.They had flown off and my feeling of responsibility had gone with them. I stood in my back garden, all around me a cacophony of tweets and squeaks as new wings were being tested out, but not the ones I was really interested in. Occasionally I spotted one of the parent birds in among all the others, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens and wood pigeons … and robins of course. Later that evening I saw one of our chicks in a tree near our bathroom window, looking tiny, out by itself in the wide, open world. But after that sighting I saw them no more, they were definitely gone.It has been said that sport has often played a vital role at times of crisis, battles on the pitch taking the nation’s mind away from battles off it. This time, it’s clear to me that nature has stepped up to take on the role of the great distractor. Thanks to this wonderful family of tiny birds, the natural world handed me solace and respite, helping me keep my sanity during this crazy spring. Thank you my beautiful bum barrels, I’ll never forget you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b47929c4e58a35fa8151684dcbb58e8d59477fb/0_138_4144_2487/master/4144.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=758150bd3132303cf3ea68c6893d47d6","title":"my favourite film aged 12 cruel intentions","story":"This stylish 1999 take on the aristocratic sexual scheming of Les Liaisons Dangereuses remains just as seductive as when I first saw itI don’t know what it says about me that my favourite film aged 12 is my favourite film aged 30. It could mean that I am enduringly loyal, knew my mind at a young age, and had mature tastes. Or it could be that I haven’t developed at all as an inidual and am stubborn as a wine stain.My favourite film is Cruel Intentions. Nowadays it sits in my affections alongside more serious and arty fair, as well as classics: Three Colours Blue, Some Like It Hot, Persona, The Silence of the Lambs etc. Back then, in the late 90s, its competitors were The Craft (1996), Anaconda (1997), Scream (1996),Clueless (1995). All of these I was introduced to via Blockbuster VHS rental.For those of you unfamiliar, Cruel Intentions is a 1999-modern take on Stephen Frears’ Dangerous Liaisons (1988), itself an adaptation of Christopher Hampton’s 1985 play, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, itself an adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ 1782 epistolary novel. The novel tells the tale of the sexual scheming of the aristocratic Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, narcissistic ex-lovers who get their kicks – and their rocks off – by manipulatively seducing paramours unsuspecting of their status as mere pawns in Merteuil’s and Valmont’s cruel, competitive game of conquests.Valmont, however, is redeemed by his eventual love for Madame de Tourvel, originally the subject of a bet with Merteuil. All this is set against the decadence of the ancien régime, in the decade leading up to the 1789 French Revolution. Though I imagine you had already grasped this was in France.Of course, I wasn’t aware of all this aged 12, though pretentiously and precociously I did read Laclos’ book aged about 15. In Cruel Intentions, the re-imagined “Kathyrn” Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and “Sebastian” Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) are private-high-school step-siblings, enjoying their summer holidays in their Upper East Side pad, their rich and negligent parents nowhere to be seen. Their main hobby aside from shopping, horse-riding and driving around in vintage cars? Shagging, of course. Meanwhile, the Tourvel character becomes the new girl at school, “Annette” (Reese Witherspoon). As with the book, there is an additional subplot a true cat’s cradle of heartstrings.What did I love about Cruel Intentions then, and what do I love about it now? Some things sit in the centre of the Venn diagram, others are split with time. Sebastian’s initial cruelty is countered with incredible charm, the cheek of his smile and confident, caustic wit. As a young pretender, I was insatiably drawn to his pithy one-liners, brilliantly scripted by Roger Kumble, who also directed – and whose entire career has been defined by this film.I thought (and perhaps still think) there is no more suave answer to the question, “What are you doing tomorrow?” than “I’m going out with you.” There is the scene where Sebastian remotely blares classical music into Annette’s room – and only her room – when they are staying in the same house. Then switches the music to the Cardigans’ Lovefool when she comes to remonstrate with him. The way he teases her when asking her to join him for a swim, and she, also capable of smarts, replies: “I suppose your proposal was only mildly insulting, so I’ll consider it.”Did I mirror Sebastian’s positive characteristics (even if he often employed them insincerely)? Did I start louchely standing with my hands in my pockets the exact way he did and begin to keep a leather-bound journal? Was I hornily rewatching the film to satisfy my burgeoning, or, more accurately, burgeoned, interest in all things sexual? Yes to all. Aged 12, I simultaneously wanted to be Sebastian and to be with Phillippe. I was not happy that he ended up marrying Witherspoon in real life.In a many ways, the film was progressive. It included a lingering woman-on-woman snog (which won the MTV movie award for best kiss) – and this only two years after Ellen DeGeneres came out, with her show cancelled after a backlash. Sebastian’s best friend (played by yet another 90s staple, Joshua Jackson) was gay, without comment. I was keen, too, on the unabashedly feminist (though I wouldn’t have used the f-word then) attitude of Kathyrn: “God forbid, I exude confidence and enjoy sex” railing against the confines of womanhood and gender double standards. (“Do you think I relish the fact I have to act like Mary Sunshine 247 so I can be considered a lady?”) Racism was addressed, too: a character played by Sean Patrick Thomas being told he’d been helped “off the streets”. “Off the streets? I live at 59th and Park.”The soundtrack: still one of the best. Mostly a mix of mainstream, cool (Blur, Fatboy Slim, Placebo etc) and bands I had never heard of before, and have never heard of since. Listening to Bitter Sweet Symphony by the Verve, which plays during the end scene, still makes me cry and swoon moodily as it did then. And that end scene retains all of its stirring, triumphant power.I also was not (and am not) immune to the film’s aesthetic luxuries: the sweeping shots of the New York skyline the wide angles of a country house in the Hamptons, the costume design of Kathryn’s flattering couture dresses and Sebastian’s old-school tennis whites.There has been some present-day criticism that Sebastian more or less tricks one of his conquests into oral sex (“He took down my pants and he started writing the alphabet but he was writing it with his tongue”). But this is the exact kind of behaviour implicit to his character, long before the transitional moment when Annette says to him, “I’m impressed”, and he replies, “Well, I’m in love”, which somehow manages to make riding an escalator romantic.The only thing that could ever taint the film would be watching the roundly panned sequels and prequels with none of the original cast members, which is why I pretend they do not exist. A cancelled television series a second and third film, both straight-to-video. I ignore these because though Laclos’ cautionary tale of morality is timeless that, to this day, it teaches us things about the complexity and contradictions of people, I do not want Kumble’s translation diluted.The brilliant screenplay, which gave the story a sassier, more optimistic ending than the book. The genius of the new setting. The perfect casting (Phillippe – much more charismatic than the reptilian John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Dominic West have all had a bash on stage or screen, too) Gellar, famously blond in her mainstream television role as Buffy Summers, going unrecognisably brunette Witherspoon showing her range by playing the opposite of Tracy Flick in Election support from Selma Blair and others Christine Baranski!). Fortunately, a television reboot mooted in 2016 only made it as far as an unaired pilot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3325fb71c622d9028ba2b5fa5223d05b26246760/0_41_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b799cea4adc968396922a9a98f63bd4","title":"10 of the best icing recipes buttercream chocolate ganache frosting","story":"For that final touch, there are plenty of frosting options to spruce up your bakes – so get whisking They flash past you on The Great British Bake Off, with their elegant names and particular methods, but how many of us know how to make more than a few of the dozens of cake icings that exist? Here are 10 of the best recipes, from basic to exotic.\u0026nbspThis is what you would would probably come up with if you were just guessing how icing was made: sugar and water, stirred together. That’s pretty much all there is to it, but the water should be boiled and added to the icing sugar slowly, or the result can end up too thin. At the right consistency it can be drizzled on to cakes or used to ice buns or biscuits. Dan Lepard’s recipe includes variations such as orange water icing, coffee, lemon and ginger.\u0026nbspButtercream is perfect for covering the imperfections of a home-made birthday cake – like filler on a damaged wall. Once you have slathered it on with a flat knife, no one need know what’s going on underneath. It’s pretty versatile – you can also use it for decorative piping, or to top cupcakes. If you are only ever going to learn to make one sort of icing, this should be the one. \u0026nbspButtercream is a whipped blend of icing sugar, unsalted butter (and, in some recipes, a pinch of salt), a little milk to thin and flavouring – most often vanilla. The trick, insofar as there is one, is to beat it for longer than you think – first the butter alone, and then with the sugar added in stages. It should be almost white when you’re done, but if it isn’t quite, that’s fine – it tastes the same. A paler brand of butter yields a whiter icing, and some cooks say you can offset a slight yellow tinge with the tiniest drop of blue food dye. I say: quit while you’re ahead.\u0026nbspJemma from the Crumbs \u0026amp Doilies bakery in London offers a pretty comprehensive YouTube buttercream tutorial. Buttercream flavours can include chocolate (using cocoa powder), coffee, lemon (using juice and zest), strawberry (fresh pureed fruit, plus a tablespoon of jam) or just about anything else, bearing in mind that any added liquid will change the consistency, so you might need to compensate by using less milk.\u0026nbspSwiss meringue buttercream is a “next level” version of buttercream: lighter, whiter, better for piping, less sickly sweet, more elegant and consequently harder to make. It’s a mixture of egg whites, butter and sugar, and it involves cooking: the egg whites and sugar are heated together until the sugar dissolves (another alternative, Italian meringue buttercream, requires a hot sugar syrup, and there are disputes about which of the two recipes is the more troublesome). For either option a stand mixer is a blessing, but an electric whisk works fine – you will just be holding it for a really long time. If you have only got a hand whisk some people would tell you not to bother, and I am one of them. You will wish you never started.\u0026nbspThis video from Preppy Kitchen is a thorough and non-intimidating introduction to the art. Claire Ptak’s mango buttercream is obviously meant to go on her mango cake, but you could certainly substitute other flavours for the mango puree.\u0026nbspThis is easy, and disproportionately impressive: use equal parts double cream and good dark chocolate, chopped into bits. Heat up the cream until it’s just boiling and pour it over the broken-up chocolate, then whisk this mixture together until it’s glossy. After it’s cooled slightly you can pour it over a cake and it will set smooth and shiny. It’s so simple that this how-to video hasn’t any commentary.If you use white chocolate you can add other flavours – Kim Joy’s chocolate penguin biscuits contain an orange ganache that would certainly sit well on a cupcake.\u0026nbspOne more chocolate trick: if you melt plain dark chocolate and let it cool a while you can pipe it in lacy designs on to greaseproof paper, and when it’s partly set you can wrap the whole thing around a frosted cake. When fully set an hour later, peel the paper away to reveal a cake with lacy chocolate sides. See Mary Berry’s showstopper cake, which has white chocolate ganache and lacy sides. To figure out how much side you will need to make, multiply the diameter of your cake tin by pi (3.14159). It’s a bit more than you’d think.\u0026nbspCream-cheese icing is just that – cream cheese beaten with sugar until it’s spreadable. It’s most often used on carrot cake, banana bread, red velvet cake (and cupcake versions of all three). Sometimes it has butter in it, as in this recipe, and sometimes not. Felicity Cloake\u0026nbspleaves out the butter but uses brown sugar and lemon when topping her perfect carrot cake.Liam Charles’s carrot cake, on the other hand, employs a topping made from cream cheese and double cream, and yoghurt, sweetened with both icing sugar and maple syrup. Once again, the ingredients are just beaten together, albeit in a particular order.\u0026nbspYou can also fashion icing with mascarpone instead of cream cheese, for example in Nigel Slater’s coffee mascarpone frosting, which also has a bit of butter in it. For the best coffee flavour, according to Slater, even the finest espresso does not work as well as instant coffee of undrinkable strength.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0c8d9ddcff3bcc72509b7fbd1249f04f3528d8/0_62_2554_1532/master/2554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a65b4f1c93473415c59d0c8d6c93269","title":"how to bake a summer picnic quiche kitchen aide","story":"Stop thinking of quiche as a tart, but as a baked custard in a pastry shell, and you’re halfway to summer perfection• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theMy quiche always turns out stodgy or watery. Where am I going wrong?Rosie, Bicester, Oxfordshire\u0026nbsp“Quiche has been a great boon these last few months,” says Jeremy Lee, head chef of London’s Quo Vadis, whose lockdown adventures have included classic lorraine, greens, potato and cheddar, and asparagus. Done correctly, Lee says, quiche is a thing of beauty, but its reputation has been bruised by indigestible, meanly filled supermarket offerings (or, as he puts it, “utterly lifeless matter”), so Rosie is right to persevere.The path to a rich yet light custard that holds just so starts with a change of mindset, says Feast perfectionist Felicity Cloake: “I understood quiche a lot better once I stopped thinking of it as a tart in which the ingredients are bound together by egg, and started thinking of it as a baked custard in a pastry shell.”There’s nowhere to hide when it comes to that custard, however, and its success for the most part comes down to the dairy. “We’ve become so nervous of dairy that folk have forgotten how good cream is,” says Lee, who uses 300ml double cream, three egg yolks, one whole egg, a scrape of nutmeg and some salt and pepper. More specifically, Cloake adds, being heavy handed with egg (the white contains a lot of protein) or opting for milk or low-fat dairy can result in a rubbery or watery custard. Creme fraiche is another option, but Lee finds it “too tangy. It’s cream or bust.”\u0026nbspDepending on what you have to hand, you could then add cooked asparagus, peas, spinach, broad beans or jersey royals – and lots of cheese. “It’s a great vehicle for whatever’s in the fridge,” Lee says. “A chunk of gruyère, parmesan or cheddar all work incredibly well.” Cloake, however, is a purist and keeps the contents of her filling to a minimum: “Let the custard be the star.” \u0026nbspNext, the baking. To achieve that wonderful wobble and prevent overcooking, use a deep tart tin, Cloake says, before suggesting an alternative approach: “The Brotherhood of the Quiche Lorraine do not blind bake the case, so only the outside is lovely and crisp, and the bottom a bit doughy. It’s a matter of taste, but know that it is sanctioned by the authorities.”For those looking to stand on safer ground, Lee makes a shortcrust pastry with 300g butter to 500g flour, plus egg and milk. After chilling, he lets the pastry come up to ambient temperature before rolling, to preventing cracking. He then blind bakes at 180C fan for 35-40 minutes to get a really crisp shell, before lowering the heat to 150C fan, adding the custard and baking for 25-35 minutes. “It’s never quite the same twice, but that’s part of the fun,” he says. Once your quiche is puffed and golden, don’t ruin your efforts by tucking in immediately: “Just warm is ideal, so give it 15-20 minutes to settle,” Lee says.\u0026nbspA quiche deserves to be surrounded by salads or sliced up for a socially distanced picnic, though for Lee it’s the ideal companion to watching a film on the sofa, with “little slices to nibble on throughout the day, should there be any left … which I always find quite remarkable”.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

After entering it as Arsenal’s player of the season, an early ankle injury stripped his confidence bare. His struggles in front of goal led to a nine-game drought until February, made worse by the fact that his presence shifted Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to the flank. This seems like an important opportunity for him to return with a clean slate and provide Mikel Arteta with some enthusiasm for his future at the club. Otherwise there will be many questions.After making an ill-advised trip to a friend’s house, crashing into two parked cars and, worst of all, walking around in mismatched slippers, Grealish was surely relieved to watch the focus shift in early April as Kyle Walker’s sex party and defiant response became the lockdown-breaching story du jour. Walker’s transgressions were messier, but perhaps Grealish’s were more revealing. The playmaker’s unprofessionalism during his youth is well documented and he was already approaching a pivotal stage in his career. This has been a tremendous season for him, and he will now look to lead Aston Villa away from relegation with the possibility of a big transfer and a potential England spot on the horizon. Now is the time for him to show that lockdown was just a lapse and even better things are to come.Pogba has barely said a word or kicked a ball this season, yet somehow drama still follows him. After months of his agent, Mino Raiola, throwing verbal punches while Pogba received incessant criticism from Graeme Souness and others, the midfielder spoke with clarity in April about his problems. His explanation to the United podcast of his foot fracture, surgery and subsequent bone growth was not nearly as dramatic as the preceding events and elicited sympathy. After months without competing, Pogba has the opportunity to string some games together and put his career back on the right path. There will be much speculation about big clubs circling and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s plans. The onus is on him to produce the form worthy of all the talk.Before sports came to a halt, José Mourinho finally made his thoughts on Tanguy Ndombele clear as he heaped blame on Tottenham’s £55m record signing after their 1-1 draw with Burnley. “I have to say he has had enough time to come to a different level,” said Mourinho. This has been an uncomfortable adjustment for Ndombele, who has completed a full Premier League game only once since the second match of the campaign. Mourinho’s comments about the 23-year-old seemed to be an attempt to force better performances and the Portuguese even broke lockdown rules for their personal fitness session. However, Mourinho’s patience is notoriously short. Now would be a good time for Ndombele to start showing what he can do.Joelinton was a low-profile player in the Austrian Bundesliga until a couple of years ago. Now he is the £40m record signing for one of the Premier League’s bigger clubs. Throughout his first season at Newcastle the burden of such a sharp rise has been clear. Steve Bruce has switched him from No 9 to the left flank and back again with only one league goal and some dire performances to show for it. Newcastle fans are frustrated. Perhaps this break will have given him an opportunity to reset, to link up better with his teammates and to find some peace in the upcoming fan-free games.The two years since Pickford’s grand performances for England at the World Cup in Russia have not been ideal. Slapstick errors have become far too familiar a sight, especially against the biggest teams. No player in the Premier League has made more errors leading to goals since August 2018. The suspension of the European Championship finals provides Pickford with more time to re-establish himself as the clear first-choice goalkeeper for Gareth Southgate – but he is going to have to start now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be3d533f21136ef94a858e6551396b70029238a/76_0_4722_2834/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e620e7245358715b45cf2fd36ea114f2","title":"premier league countdown team news previews manchester city arsenal live","story":"Raheem Sterling has told Gary Neville that we need to use this moment to “be one” and to “change society”. He says he has a platform to get this message into the right places, and though he doesn’t have all the idea or know what to do, he can get messages out there. Any Liverpool fans out there? How are you planning to celebrate when the time comes? I guess the party’s been going since January, but I can say from experience that the moment of collective catharsis is a bigun. This was mine:Thanks Alex, Daniel Harris back talking about himself in the third person. Villa Park tomorrow will be completely devoid of atmosphere and fans. And not for the first time, as detailed here:And here’s our pick of the players who will be playing for their reputations during the madcap next few weeks:It’s not just England where there’s a big game on tomorrow night. Over in Italy, famed trophy-dodger Maurizio Sarri will be taking on famed Joe Jordan-enrager Genarro Gattuso in the Coppa Italia final. For added fun, the two meet with Gattuso in charge of Sarri’s old club, Napoli, while Sarri is of course managing Juventus and therefore in the faintly terrifying position of Really Having To Win.Gattuso sounds up for it: “When other teams put us under pressure, we know how to suffer and deal with it. If we manage to defend and attack with humility, we can achieve great things.”And on a similar theme, the Premier League’s chief executive says he supported the move to have the words “Black Lives Matter” on players’ shirts in this week’s games, saying it represents an ethical stance rather than a political one. Teams will also have logos supporting the NHS on their shirts.“I support them in using their platforms to push good causes. I think it is a good thing that players are using their voices to make what I think are ethical value judgements rather than political statements.” said Richard Masters. “There is a strong and longstanding commitment from the Premier League and all our clubs to anti-discrimination.”Asked about the Rooney Rule, which operates in the NFL, stipulating that members of minorities be interviewed for vacant coaching positions, he said: “We haven’t discussed that, and we haven’t got any plans to do so.”Make what you will of that.In other Manchester-based humanitarianism news, Man City players will have “Cityzens Giving For Recovery” on front of their shirts when they play Arsenal tomorrow as part of a new campaign aimed at raising an additional £1m to help people get back on their feet following the coronavirus crisis. City Football Group has already committed close to that figure in donations, in-kind support and loaning of facilities to the emergency effort.“Frontline workers around the world have heroically responded to the immediate threat of Covid-19,” says chief executive Ferran Soriano. “We have been privileged to play our own small part in helping to address that immediate threat. Now is the time for us to look forward, committing to meeting our responsibility to help our communities recover.”Here’s Marina Hyde on Marcus Rashford and the Tory cabinet. Plenty to enjoy:Anyhow, I’m off for lunch – Alex Hess will narrate you through the next hour. I was thinking last night that if other players joined in, that’d be immense, but there’s also something about Rashford. Everyone likes him, and the simplicity – the purity – of him, on his own, seeking to resolve an issue that affected his own childhood, is extremely compelling. How would anyone go about arguing against him? Now, I wonder where we go from here. Does Rashford retreat, having resolved this one issue, or does he, perhaps with help from other players, keep up the pressure to bring about more change? I think we need to be very clear in spelling out what’s happened here. Marcus Rashford called out the government’s cruelty on live television – wearing shorts, socks and slides – they tried to blow him out, then caved a day later. These are absolutely incredible scenes. I think my eyeballs might be sweating. What an absolute hero. OTD 1990 – England and Netherlands play out a 0-0 draw. “Another reason to hope that Danny Welbeck makes a decent return to form,” emails David Wall, “is that he’s one of those players who has almost been better, and more important, for his country than for his clubs (see also Darius Vassell). Especially under Roy Hodgson he seemed more assured of his place in the national team than in his club team. Given how important he was on the left side of the attack for Hodgson’s side (including his defensive diligence), I think his injury before Euro 2016 was a key factor in England’s under-performance in that tournament.”For England, he’ll never be more than a squad player now. Obviously Harry Kane will be through the middle, and wide of him will be two of Rashford, Sterling and Sancho. I’d go for the first two, but it’s a great choice for Gareth Southgate to have. And thinking about who else is available, I don’t think it’ll be long before Bukayo Saka and Mason Greenwood are in the mix. City also have Leroy Sané back, and if he’s not mentally checked out, that will be huge. Him being fit gives them width on the left, allows Raheem Sterling to play on the right, and Bernardo Silva to play centrally. I’m still not sure what happens in defence – do they keep Fernandinho there to avoid using Stones or Otamendi, or restore him to midfield and hope to keep the ball away from the back four? Let’s have a little think about Manchester City, who are in a strong position to make a run at the Champions League. Of all the teams in Europe, their best is probably the best, but even with Aymeric Laporte back, you wonder whether their defence and keeper will cost them eventually. I’m not sure I’d pick them to impose their best on Bayern, but those two look the pick of things.Apparently Lil Mikey Dean will be reffing the Merseyside derby. That could be an absolute treat. On which point, I’m looking forward to seeing Daniel Welbeck back in the game. He’s had such bad luck in his career, first when Alex Ferguson retired – Fergie properly rated him and would’ve got more out of him than David Moyes or Louis van Gaal – and also with injury. He’s a lovely player when he’s on his game, with a lovely touch and imagination, who makes those around him play better and is also fast and strong. Here’s Simon Burnton’s Watford preview. They really should not be going down. Forest won this game 1-0. Personally, I blame Paul Pogba. Yesssssss. Here’s your latest Squires.Chris Wilder news: “We’ve just got to make sure we’ve got some fuel in the tank for the Ford Fiesta and the tyres are pumped up. With a bit of luck we push the Lamborghinis close,” he told the Times.“Hopefully, we can turn a fabulous season into a memorable one.”Three months without football has been hard on a personal level, he added.“I’ve been a nightmare,” Wilder said. “How I’ve not been booted out into the back bedroom... I’ve been a manager for 20 years and in the game since I was 16, so being out of it for three months has been really difficult.”The team, however, are in good shape and fired up for the restart.“Our message to the players was that this was a pause,” Wilder added. “It wasn’t a period for downing tools.“They have climbed the mountain and come the restart we didn’t want them falling off the cliff. They’ve kept themselves in great shape.”The next obstacle is a Villa side who are second-bottom and fighting for survival.“I’m sure (Villa manager) Dean Smith will be fired up,” Wilder said. “I don’t know if it will be good entertainment or Keystone Cops, but we’re looking forward to it.”I wonder which players will have stepped up a level over the break. Mason Greenwood looks to have filled out – if so, that will be significant because if he can put himself about and hold the ball up, he’ll be well on the way to becoming an all-round centre-forward. On This Day 1996. I’ve never forgiven my parents for banning me from going this game with my mates.

Broadcasters’ reputations have taken a hit but they continue to score relatively highly, while the  is now the most trusted non-financial newspaper among the general public.However, the figures suggest there has been a substantial negative shift in attitudes towards the wider media industry among Britons. As a result, Britain now ranks below the likes of the US and Hong Kong when it comes to public trust in the media.The research also suggests it may be time to reappraise which news outlets are considered to be the biggest in the country, in an age where print newspaper sales continue to collapse and even Rupert Murdoch’s News UK – the owner of the Times and the Sun – is moving towards a digital-focused operation.Rather than the traditional ranking of outlets by print newspaper sales, the report points towards the emergence of a group of four major British news outlets with mass online audiences: BBC News, the , MailOnline and Sky News.The BBC remains the most trusted national news outlet, but support among the most politically partisan consumers – on both the left and right – has fallen by 20 percentage points since 2018.The study found there was a “silent majority” of Britons who still strongly wanted the news to be presented in a “neutral and detached” manner, backing BBC news bosses who discourage their reporters from expressing personal political views on social media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0974debfde28a284d1135ff64202d9a7c64c8bd7/0_11_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f45f222a2c500bf167c20b481c359ffb","title":"once again copycat sites creep back to the top of google","story":"Lookalike sites fool you into paying for a free government service after making a searchI’ve been fooled into paying £40 to change my driving licence address with the DVLA, when I could have done it for free on gov.uk.The companies offering the “service” take out Google Ads above the official gov.uk web link.

It was a mistake, but the title stayed – some people thought we were being clever’ I was an avid collector of disco and funk records. On my first trip to the US, I spent most of my time in secondhand vinyl shops and found Loleatta Holloway’s Love Sensation. At the time, I was playing with my Akai S900 sampler when I was DJing and searching for a cappella vocals to enrich my set. When I listened to Love Sensation, I thought: “This is good stuff.” People were using a lot of powerful vocals in their records – like The Power by Snap. My bandmate Mirko Limoni and I wanted to make the most energetic record in the world, and we were trying to collect material for that.Alfredo, who was the DJ at the Ibiza club Amnesia, bought it. Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold went to Amnesia and heard the record. So Oakenfold and Rampling decided it was time to go to Rimini, which was like the Italian Ibiza, where they bought as many copies as they could to take back to England. Later, Oakenfold told me he had paid for his holiday with copies of Ride on Time he had bought in Rimini and then resold.In the meantime, the label Deconstruction called Discomagic said they really wanted to license the first track Mirko and I made together – Starlight’s Numero Uno. Discomagic said: “Unfortunately, we just licensed it to Beggars Banquet. But we’ve got something we think is even better.” Deconstruction told me they couldn’t believe their ears when they heard it. And that was Ride on Time.I couldn’t believe my luck the first time we were on Top of the Pops. We were in the same room as Phil Collins and Eurythmics – and they were talking to us!Our bad English was the reason it was called Ride on Time. We thought she was singing “ride on time”, but it was “right on time”. Of course it was a mistake, but the title stayed. It’s one of those mistakes that’s funny. Some people thought we were being clever.We thought we would sell a maximum of 1,000 copies for clubs. For us, that would have been like winning the London marathon. It was a big surprise when it blew up. Of course we were happy about it, but then the problems came. The same day we took the plane to England to be on Top of the Pops, we had to deal with the American lawyer threatening us.I didn’t realise, while I was living it, how big Ride on Time was. When I look back, it seems bigger than it did at the time. My best memory of it is the night we received the phone call from Deconstruction after the midweek charts to say we were going to be No 1. The record had entered the charts at 39, then went up in four or five weeks to No 1 and stayed there for six weeks. When we learned it was No 1, it was very emotional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d80c7b66b4a65169d06cd54d060eb523645fd1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e1ae82aa827f367aa455343f89dc6e","title":"tulisa denies accusations of racism from x factor contestant misha b","story":"TV presenter says she regrets publicly accusing talent show singer of bullying but says ‘it’s not to do with skin colour’Pop singer and TV presenter Tulisa has denied accusations of racism and bullying made against her by Misha B, a contestant on talent show The X Factor.Tulisa appeared on the show as a judge in 2011 and 2012. Speaking on Instagram last weekend, Misha B, who came fourth in the 2011 series, said that the show’s producers, Tulisa, and fellow judge Louis Walsh had a “corrupted agenda” to frame her as a bully. “I remember thinking of ways to end my own life, ways I could end the pain,” she said.During the show, Tulisa told Misha B on camera: “You being so feisty can come off as quite mean to other contestants and I’ve been told that there’s been mean comments towards them … I think you’re going to be amazing, just put aside the attitude.”On Instagram, Misha B said: “I know that I’m not the only one who has heard those words – feisty, mean. These are common words people use to describe black women … I was aware that they were going to throw this angry black girl narrative at me.”She also said the show “created this whole narrative of me being over confident, because you are black and black girls are not supposed to be confident”.Tulisa has responded by writing on Instagram: “I have witnessed black people being torn down in the industry, especially black women. It is a very real and serious issue. But my issue at that time was a response to actions, and was in no way shape or form about race. I have never and will never take part in any oppressive or racist agenda.”In an accompanying video, she said: “One thing I regret is calling her out publicly … that I am truly sorry for. But to say and make claims … that it was racially motivated is ludicrous.“There had been an accumulation of things that Misha had done to other contestants, and my contestants, backstage. She had made two of my acts cry. One of them being on the night that I made those comments … I called a lot of people out on that show … it’s not to do with skin colour.”Misha B reached No 11 with her debut single Home Run in 2012, and reached No 9 with its follow-up Do You Think of Me?

Labelling themselves #blackradio, they play music from across the African diaspora that folds into the erse spectrum of black British identity, and are creating a space of community and relief for black Britons at a traumatic yet galvanising historical moment.“Whether it be R\u0026ampB, soca, drill or dancehall,” says Joseph, also known as VI, who is head of programming at the station, “we wanted to represent the black diaspora as a whole. That’s what we listen to at home or out in the clubs.”Ever since, a revolving roster of No Signal DJs, producers, playlisters and programmers have been broadcasting radio shows from the station’s website, shifting between black music genres like a heptathlete switches disciplines. They have aired everything from Saturday night dancehall party sets to Ghanaian hiplife, 70s Afro-jazz and reggae, and brought their station to listeners in 99 countries.“We’ve used the tools we could as well as we could,” says Anthony, also known as RBC, one of the station’s producers. “The internet took a radio stream with our bredrin’s to the other side of the world. We’re doing it from our bedrooms and houses with mum’s wifi, and now we’re being played in places like Mauritius.”“Our culture is rich across the board,” adds Joseph, “Everything you see here is us, is black people. Whether you’re from this place or that place, we’re all represented by the shows on this channel. We wanted people to feel like they have a home here.”#NS10v10 has been key to their success. The interactive music session is part soundclash – with roots in Jamaican soundsystem culture, where rival systems go back-and-forth with songs for crowd-crowned supremacy –\u0026nbspand part gameshow, with inspiration drawn from lockdown Instagram broadcasts such as Canadian rapper Tory Lanez’s Quarantine Radio.\u0026nbspThe rules are simple: two rival contestants represent a predetermined artist, then battle over 10 rounds, facing song choices off against one another. The winner is decided by Twitter users, who declare the strongest track in each round. “I love watching football and Love Island, and the online commentary always adds another layer of enjoyment,” says Jojo. “I thought: how can we do that, but with live audio?”The show’s first season included tracks from rappers Skepta and Giggs being pitched in a UK all-star clash, an Afro-swing standoff with J Hus and Kojo Funds, a 90s rap show between Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes, and an R\u0026ampB throwdown with Mariah Carey and Beyoncé. A special 80s v 90s edition between special guest hosts Ian Wright and Julie Adenuga saw the former England footballer use the platform to open up on the tolls of online racism.With every clash that passed, the show spread through social media, the #NS10v10 hashtag becoming an interactive dancefloor, spilling out from “black Twitter” and into new corners of the internet. The clash between Wizkid and Vybz Kartel was the tipping point. Over 200,000 listeners tuned in that evening, and since then, No Signal’s audience has continued to grow exponentially.But No Signal is more than a soundclash-slash-gameshow. With the close of the first season, the station expanded its programming. A string of new interactive shows include Ask Oloni, an agony aunt show with sex blogger Dami “Oloni” Oloniskin, and Spot the Sample with writer Jesse Bernard, which explores the samples tying together some of hip-hop’s most iconic eras and songs.\u0026nbspElsewhere, intermissions spotlight worthy causes for listeners to rally around: community platforms such as the BYP Network connect black professionals with job opportunities and The Black Curriculum is an organisation teaching school students black British history.\u0026nbsp“It’s the right thing to do – we’re a resource for people,” says Jojo. “Social media drowns out a lot and it’s hard to pay attention to certain things. But it’s beneficial for everyone to know about these great causes that need to be put out there.”\u0026nbspBy threading these wider elements into the station, No Signal display the variety in the black British experience, hosting the niche conversations and community-wide issues that, in this country, weave black identities together like willow baskets.\u0026nbspWith lockdown edging to a close, thoughts have turned to No Signal in the new world we will eventually inherit. They have already partnered with Spotify, with each #NS10v10 clash available for playback on the streaming platform, and there are plans to further establish themselves as a fully-fledged radio station, picking up the specialist black radio mantle left behind when London-based station Choice FM was absorbed into Capital.“There’s been a gap in the market for black culture,” says Neil, also known as AAA, who programmes and produces on the station, as well as hosting a show. “There are radio stations that covered grime and alternative music, but the black community had Choice FM and we proper miss that.”Until then, they continue with a scheduled programming bonding together the many faces of black music, and reviving the spirit of black club nights shuttered by quarantine. Amid isolation, they have become more than radio: a gathering for those seeking out community in lonely times.\u0026nbspThe second season of #NS10v10, meanwhile, is under way, and Twitter timelines are once again turning into dancefloors. In the Boy Bands v Girl Bands clash, full of 90s throwbacks and house party gems, selector Nicksy is taunting her rival. “These are connoisseurs, these are uncles, these are OGs in the game!” she laughs as Premier Gaou by Ivorian group Magic System fades in: “African hall party classic!”• This article was amended on Tuesday 16 June to correct the real names of the DJs AAA and RBC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e224368694f02db1d63ef736934da6690cbd92/0_18_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f5ed3327e1d5fc7d19f157fa1bbecf","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

We give 10 times as much aid to Tanzania as we do to the six countries of the western Balkans, who are acutely vulnerable to Russian meddling.“Regardless of the merits of these decisions, no single department is currently empowered to judge whether they make sense or not: and so we tolerate an inherent risk of our left and right hands working independently.”Regional trade commissioners working in the business department are also to be brought into the revamped department.It was made clear Raab will be in the cabinet but it was not clear if Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Britain’s last international development secretary, will retain a cabinet post after the autumn.The announcement was condemned immediately as turning Britain’s back on the world’s poorest.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, responding to Johnson’s statement, described it as “the tactics of pure distraction”, against a backdrop of rising unemployment and one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world.“Abolishing Dfid diminishes Britain’s place in the world,” he said. “There is no rationale for making this statement today. The prime minister should stop these distractions, and get on with the job of tackling the health and economic crisis we currently face.”Patrick Watt, Christian Aid’s director of policy, public affairs and campaigns, called the decision “an act of political vandalism”, saying it “threatens a double whammy to people in poverty, and to our standing in the world”.The timing of the merger long favoured by Johnson was justified on the grounds that the UK needed to be “match fit” for major international events starting this autumn, including the 75th anniversary anniversary of the United Nations, and British chairmanship next year of the UN climate change conference.The new department will be more joined up, focused and coherent, officials said.The prime minister said: “The foreign secretary will be empowered to decide which countries receive – or cease to receive – British aid, while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the national security council, which I chair.”“Those strategies will be implemented on the ground by the relevant UK ambassador, who will lead all of the government’s work in the host country. We will learn from the examples of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all of whom run their development programmes from their foreign ministries.”In practice, the Foreign Office has been slowly taking control of the aid budget, either by directly spending more of its cash, or in country diplomats being put in charge of the budget.The Foreign Office spending has also been more directed at middle income income countries with whom the UK wishes to strengthen diplomatic ties, as opposed to poverty reduction in low-income countries, the core Dfid businessMore than a quarter of the UK aid budget is now not spent by Dfid, but other government departments including the Ministry of Defence. It is argued security is a precondition for poverty reduction.As part of the last reshuffle, the Foreign Office and aid department ministers were required to “double hat”, working in both departments. The new department will have only one permanent secretary, and no redundancies are expected.Although officials stressed the arrangement was a merger and not a takeover, few aid specialists have advocated the end of Dfid as a standalone department, saying the focus of the aid budget on poverty reduction, unsullied by UK commercial interests, contributed to UK’s soft power and reputation for aid generosity.The UK aid budget has been widely praised as being both more effective and transparent than Foreign Office spending of the aid budget. But officials say the trend worldwide has been for aid and foreign office budgets to be integrated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0b3422b4254b670c76c8ae4e817a42c4876422/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca13ffb647fb96662048026fb01db1c1","title":"moods discoveries and sharing tips and tricks to make the most of your spotify listening","story":"Get more out of your streaming with these simple hacks, from curated lists to podcasts by the shedloadHow to use Spotify: hit play, ensure ears are on.

Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

It’s the backdrop to everything from Saturday-morning pancakes to extended family get-togethers.\u0026nbspI grew up with my Nigerian parents, listening to a mix of jazz-infused African highlife, UB40 and Madonna. Along with my sisters and brothers, I loved to go through my dad’s vinyl collection in the living-room cabinet – while Stevie Wonder’s Happy Birthday would be pulled out for every anniversary celebration.My husband and I met dancing in a West End bar to 90s R\u0026ampB – think Faith Evans, Blackstreet, Puff DaddyDiddy and Ginuwine, interspersed with a touch of house, dancehall and reggae. Yep.So it was more than interesting to spend the week using Spotify’s Premium Family plan, where our music tastes and those of our two children could come together on the exclusive Family Mix feature.With the Premium Family subscription you can have up to six Premium accounts for family members living at the same address.The Family Mix then picks a selection of songs and genres that anyone on the plan has listened to, and creates a playlist.To a certain extent, my Jamaican husband and I have similar tastes when it comes to music – he will basically listen to anything with a reggae “riddim” put over it – whether it’s Beenie Man, Celine Dion or Westlife.But alongside the likes of Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men and Mark Ronson, a few surprises did pop up and I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a hidden message he was trying to convey. Like most people, the type of music I listen to depends on my mood, so when the Family Mix revealed hubby had been listening to You Win Again by the Bee Gees, I couldn’t help but smile, taking it that he had conceded defeat after a recent disagreement.\u0026nbspThe last time I played the Bee Gees to my daughter, she was six and it was less How Deep Is Your Love and more Tragedy. Their infamous high-pitched singing style did not sit well with her and she recoiled in horror asking: “What is that?”, followed by “Make it stop!”She’s now the grand old age of 10 and teetering on the edge of that weird “not quite a teenager but I want to give you the attitude of one” stage. Luckily, this time around, she had less of a profound reaction and allowed the song to play until the end.Her personal taste in music is the result of a mix of influences: her peers, favourite YouTubers and what’s popular on the online interactive gaming app, Roblox. Being younger than 13, I’m still choosing the songs for her on my profile, and that definitely came in handy when she attempted to add some of Melanie Martinez’s more unsavoury-themed songs to her playlist. Whatever she does choose still feeds into the Family Mix, so nothing is lost from her sharing my account.My youngest recently turned three, and we had a little boogie to the Family Mix in the dining room as he enjoyed his birthday breakfast. The planned barbecue was put on hold thanks to the good old British weather, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. The Family Mix was in full flow, throwing up hits from Destiny’s Child, Janet Jackson, 112, Ariana Grande, Anne-Marie and Years \u0026amp Years – a mix of old-school classics which my tweenager enjoyed, and some more current hits for her to sing along to at the top of her voice.She always fails to reign in her surprise at seeing me singing along to artists of the moment like Billie Eilish. I mean, as her mum, I couldn’t possibly be that cool, right? We also had fun with the option to change up the tempo of the Family Mix depending on your mood, or the occasion.A moon sign represents the option for a chilled and laid-back selection, then simply tap on the sun for something a little more upbeat and fast-paced – clicking off either takes you back to the standard mix.Our week is up, but you can guarantee we’ll still be tuning in for some family listening.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Face coverings have also been recommended more widely, including in Scotland, in cases where social distancing is difficult.“The main issue is that people who are deaf and have hearing loss rely heavily on visual clues for effective communication – that includes body language, gestures, facial expression and lip-reading,” said Ayla Ozmen, head of research and policy at Action on Hearing Loss. “British sign language (BSL) users also rely heavily on seeing lip patterns as well as facial expressions to understand BSL.”While those who are travelling on public transport in England with someone who relies on lip-reading are exempt from wearing face coverings, something Action on Hearing Loss welcomed, Ozmen said little had been done to publicise this, raising concerns that those legitimately not wearing masks may face abuse.And there are other problems, Ozmen said, noting the rules around masks and face coverings in hospitals come into conflict with the accessible information standard, which puts an obligation on health and social care providers to meet people’s communications needs.People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.“We absolutely understand the public health need for wearing PPE but there is also a really significant concern, a safety concern, if people aren’t able to communicate,” said Ozmen.Holly Parker, an 18-year-old from Essex who is profoundly deaf and largely relies on lip reading, said she had encountered problems as a result of face coverings.“My main method of communication is taken away. In shops I am no longer able to understand shopkeepers and this causes me a lot of anxiety,” she said, adding that she was deeply worried about the prospect of going to university if face masks had to be used during practical lessons. Deaf charities, including Action on Hearing Loss, said they welcomed the development of transparent masks, something Parker and others said would make life easier if widely used.Philip Gerrard, chief executive at Deaf Action, said the charity had been testing several prototypes of transparent face masks within the deaf community and hoped it would shortly roll these out to members of staff, clients and the wider community.“We would also like to see the government support the development of deaf-friendly face masks that are PPE approved in hospitals and care settings throughout the UK,” he said.Ian Noon, head of policy at the National Deaf Children’s Society, agreed, adding: “In the meantime, if people pick up some deaf awareness tips like being patient, writing things down or using gestures if a deaf person needs them to, this would also have a big impact.”The deafness, cognition and language research centre at University College London also issued a statement calling for greater awareness of the challenges around hearing difficulties and face masks, but said transparent face shields were a better solution, because they let the whole face be seen.But, it added, dialogue with deaf communities was crucial, noting: “Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are best placed to advise on design needs and ensure any products are fit for purpose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/924173ce364106c0937e80531b304d74d30fb7da/0_111_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4e7b2c3460baef6fb67c9bc4e4ec36","title":"james partridge face masks could increase anxiety for people with disfigurements","story":"The founder of Face Equality International on coming out of lockdown and his battle to overcome prejudiceJames Partridge is in two minds about the wearing of face masks, which became mandatory on 15 June on public transport in England. As the director of Face Equality International he is concerned that by hiding disfigured faces, masks will prevent the public awareness-raising he has championed for the best part of 30 years.“For health reasons it’s very important to protect yourself from others,” he says, “but face masks could increase the social awkwardness of facial disfigurement. People may feel more anonymous, which is great in some ways – not to be asked stupid questions, or starred or pointed at – but of course they will then have the difficulty of taking off their mask at some point and that could be very anxious-making.”More than 500,000 adults and children in the UK have some kind of facial disfigurement ranging from cleft lip and palate or birth marks, to injuries sustained in a fire, or developing a condition such as Bell’s palsy or facial cancer.Partridge, 67, suffered severe burns in a car fire, aged 18, just before going to university. His own struggle to come to terms with the shame, anger and depression he experienced and his subsequent fight to overcome prejudice and help others, is charted in a new book Face It: Facial Disfigurement and My Fight for Face Equality published this week. Part survivor memoir, part self-help manual and part manifesto for social change, Partridge says he has written the book he wished had been available to him.Not only did he have to come to terms with his unrecognisable face, which he called *IT*, but he had to build a new resilient person able to tolerate the intrusions and assumptions that went with *IT*.“I was groping in the dark. It was a long, long struggle to get out the other side. I didn’t really have any guidance,” he says.So how has he found lockdown? OK, he says, he has been shielding for an unrelated health issue, but for many with a facial disfigurement seeing themselves on Zoom during online meetings has taken some getting used to. “It’s not a friendly process, especially for someone who is just adjusting to having a facial disfigurement. You are partly looking at yourself which can be quite disturbing,” he explains.And Partridge is very concerned about reports he has heard that lockdown is exacerbating online abuse for people with disabilities on social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.“Social media is such a wonderful way to connect people, but the downside is really vile,” he says. “Some of the abuse that’s put out there beggars belief. We have to find ways of getting social media companies to moderate, act upon and probably outlaw this sort of commentary and memes that are just totally unacceptable.”But the main anxiety for people with a facial disfigurement will be coming out of lockdown. Many, such as those with auto-immune and cranio-facial conditions, will have been shielding due to underlying health issues, and so will still have to stay at home. But for others who would have felt safe and secure cocooned in their own home away from public scrutiny, the thought of going back out into the world again will feel daunting and they will need support.“It does take an effort to get out, to go shopping, to go to work, or to get on public transport. Sometimes it becomes second nature, but often it doesn’t and suddenly having to do it all again after you’ve been stuck at home will be quite difficult,” says Partridge, recalling his own early experiences.Fifty years after the accident, he now describes his face as “a hotchpotch of scars, skin grafts and weird asymmetry (thanks to brilliant surgery)” and says “I live with my very distinctive face with pride.” It drove him to set up Changing Faces in 1992 to provide support for people with facial disfigurementsand their families by developing confidence-boosting tools like a disfigurement-specific cognitive behavioural therapy programme.Having successfully campaigned at Changing Faces to get legal protection in the UK for people with “severe disfigurements”, Partridge now hopes to do the same for people in countries such as South Africa and India, where they have no such protection or rights.The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does not explicitly recognise that people with facial disfigurements can be vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination at work, in education and the media (and social media) and in public places. Face Equality International, a global alliance Partridge founded two years ago that now has 36 NGO members, will be striving to get that recognition, he says, so that governments are obliged to instigate local legal protections.There are now more people in the public eye with a facial disfigurement including TV presenter Katie Piper, who survived an acid attack, actor Adam Pearson who has neurofibromatosis – a genetic disorder that causes tumours – and Canadian model Winne Harlow, who has the skin condition vitiligo.Yet for every step forward, new obstacles seem to appear on the long road to face equality. Airbrushing apps used by millions of young people on social media mean that a new generation is bombarded with unobtainable images of beauty on their phones 247. Cosmetic surgery has now become so normalised that if you have a less than perfect face it’s seen nowadays as your own fault. “There is almost a moral obligation to have work done, to get your face fixed”, says Partridge. He has warned for many years of the potential dangers of cosmetic surgery and how it needs to be much better regulated, but says “the government has failed to get a grip of the whole problem”.Despite coronavirus, FEI celebrated its second international face equality week last month with a digital campaign in which 1,200 people worldwide with facial disfigurement did something they don’t usually do – took a selfie and shared it. And earlier this year, FEI published an international set of guidelines to help media organisations and professionals avoid stigmatising and stereotyping people with disfigurements.But the entertainment industry doesn’t help. The latest James Bond film apparently has two baddies with facial disfigurements, says Partridge. He will use the film’s delayed release as an opportunity to raise awareness about how this shorthand for a movie villain continues to stigmatises people. He has also written to film director Sir Peter Jackson and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos about the new Lord of the Rings TV extravaganza which will “lazily portray the ‘baddie’ Orcs as facially (and bodily) flawed”, when Tolkein didn’t. “We have to take the fight to those who continue to promulgate these stereotypes,” says Partridge with his characteristic optimism.It’s hard to believe that this charming and confident campaigner, who makes you feel totally at ease with the burn scars on his face, wasn’t always like this.“Self-belief and self-respect are very hard things to find if you have had them blown away,” Partridge insists.

He was funded by some of its leading figuresWhen horse racing became the first major sport, alongside snooker and greyhound racing, to return to action following its suspension due to Covid-19 at the start of this month, Matt Hancock was forthright in his delight.“Thanks to the nation’s resolve, horseracing is back from Monday,” the health secretary tweeted. “Wonderful news for our wonderful sport.”Some of those replying, including Jo Goodman, whose 72-year-old father, Stuart, died from coronavirus on 2 April, did not consider the news to be a moment for such unbridled celebration.But Hancock, along with other senior Conservatives, has nurtured a close relationship with the industry. Hancock is the MP for Newmarket, flat horse racing’s headquarters and seat of the Jockey Club, and he receives tens of thousands of pounds in donations from wealthy racehorse owners, trainers and other members of the sport’s establishment.The Jockey Club, the historic organisation that owns racecourses at Newmarket and around the country, has two prominent Conservative figures on its board: Dido Harding, the former TalkTalk chief executive and Tory peer who has been put in charge of the government’s crucial Covid-19 test-and-trace operation and Rose Paterson, the wife of the senior backbench MP Owen Paterson. Rose Paterson is also chair of Aintree racecourse, whose signature race, the Grand National, is sponsored by Randox Health, the diagnostics company advised by her husband that has been given a £133m contract to produce testing kits – without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.A source close to the Jockey Club said Harding and Rose Paterson had played no part in the process of racing being given the go-ahead to restart, which was managed by the governing body, the British Horseracing Association, to meet safety protocols set out by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. A spokesperson for Hancock said he had not taken part in any of the discussions, nor in the decision for the Cheltenham festival to go ahead on 10-13 March as the virus was spreading.During the election campaign Hancock rode the thoroughbred Star of Bengal, a horse owned by Carole Bamford, founder of the Daylesford organic farm shop chain, and wife of Anthony Bamford, the chairman of JCB, a prominent donor to the Conservative party and Brexit supporter. Hancock, wearing the party’s rosette on the gallops, tweeted afterwards: “Brilliant riding out in Newmarket this weekend on Star of Bengal. I’ll always support the wonderful sport of horseracing.”Asked about the ride, a spokesperson for Lady Bamford told the : “Lady Bamford has never met and does not know Matt Hancock. Equally she was unaware of him riding Star of Bengal last December.”Hancock’s spokesman said the ride had been arranged with John Gosden, Star of Bengal’s trainer. He was a donor to Hancock last year, paying £10,000 towards his constituency office costs. Gosden’s wife, Rachel Hood, a Conservative councillor on Suffolk county council, former president of the Racehorse Owners Association and mayor of Newmarket until last month, donated £10,000 in December 2018. Neither responded to an email from the  with questions about the donations.The entry for Hancock in the current House of Commons register of members’ interests lists £68,000 in donations since last May paid by horse racing industry figures. The largest was £25,000 paid by Unex Holdings, a Newmarket company owned by Bill Gredley, a celebrated racehorse owner and property developer, which made a £24m profit in 2018-19, according to its most recent published accounts.Gredley told the  that he gave the money towards Hancock’s constituency office costs, and had had no discussions with him about the return of racing. “I support the Tories and I support the community,” he said. “It goes to his constituency office, which has to be paid for. That’s where we’re involved, I just give him a donation, with others.”He said Hancock came to the Christmas lunch and other events for older people in Newmarket that Gredley runs through his longstanding charitable foundation. “That’s how I got to know him, and I think he’s doing a great job. I haven’t discussed the return of racing with him we’ve never talked about it.”Tattersalls, the leading racehorse bloodstock auctioneers and valuers based in Newmarket, which hold a flagship annual sale at the Cheltenham festival, gave Hancock two separate £10,000 donations, one in May last year for his constituency office, the other in November during his general election campaign. The company did not respond to questions about the reasons for the donations. Peter Stanley, the owner of the New England stud in Newmarket and a Jockey Club board member, who donated £5,000 towards Hancock’s constituency office costs, explained: “As MP for Newmarket I think he recognises that horse racing is more of an industry than a sport. He knows better than most that we are a huge export industry and foreign currency earner. I did not speak to him about getting racing started.”Claire Unwin, who stood for Labour unsuccessfully against Hancock at the election, said of the donations: “They show that he represents the wealthy, horse racing establishment in Newmarket and not the whole constituency, which is very unequal and where there are areas of severe deprivation.”Hancock declined to respond to that charge. His spokesperson said of the donations: “Matt has been an avid fan of horse racing since childhood and is passionate about the sport. Any political donations have been declared properly and, of course, done so in an open and fully transparent way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4555be6f6c5c2ba275ca0fe084e05050b93cb0e6/0_125_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=601ec338e86dd1fe22dab6076e290003","title":"royal ascot day one horse racing queen anne live updates","story":"Newsflash: Of course, Frankie Dettori did the flying dismount on returning after victory in the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes on Frankly Darlimg.One tip for anyone planning to visit a post-lockdown betting shop: take your own pen, because the days of the classic betting-shop stubbie are surely numbered. There’s still a few on the counter if you ask, but they have to be binned after a single use, so supplies are likely to be limited. In most other respects, the betting-shop experience in the age of social distancing is much the same as before – if you are only popping in to put a bet on, at any rate. But the days when the local shop was as much a social club for its regulars as a place to gamble could be over, if the William Hill on Queen’s Road in Brighton is any guide. No more than eight customers are allowed in the shop at any one time, the only chairs are parked in front of the FOBT machines, and those are shielded from each other by plastic screens. This is not a place where people are going to be encouraged to linger. The old-fashioned dash for the betting window a few seconds before the off is also history. Punters must queue one at a time for the cashier, and wait their turn at a two-metre distance. In the circumstances, though, it sounds as if business has been better than some expected. “Ascot helps,” one of the staff said, “but it’s felt like normal. I was thinking it might be really quiet.”They’re off ... Golden Lips takes the lead early with Frankly Darling, running keenly, in second spot ... Miss Yoda in third at this early stage ... Golden Lips two lengths clear ... West End Girl moves up to third ... Frankly Darling goes for home two furlongs out ... goes a few lengths clear and wins for Frankie Dettori.Normally a consolation for beaten Oaks contenders, this has become a trial for the Epsom Classic, to be held next month. Frankly Darling is easy to like after her Newcastle success, when she showed an impressive stride in the straight. She’s lightly raced and inexperienced but so are many of her rivals. Her stablemate, Miss Yoda, won the Lingfield Oaks Trial but the yard seem to be clear that Frankly Darling is the better prospect. Aidan O’Brien has won the 1,000 Guineas in England and Ireland this season but does not seem to have a strong hand here, Passion having proved rather a letdown at Navan last week. Ennistymon has achieved less so far but might be a better prospect for the Irishman. Trefoil needs to step up on a slightly disappointing return nine days ago. Hold Fast should appreciate the extra quarter-mile and could get involved.Circus Maximus reportedly getting steamed up in the paddock ... it is a sultry day but can’t see that is his usual demeanour before the races ... and they’re off ... Circus Maximus is prominent with Marie’s Diamond ... the field moves towards the near rail ... Circus Maximus makes his move with Terebellum moving strongly ... Terebellum and Circus Maximus go past together .. what a race ... with Circus Maximus getting up on the line ... and avoiding more embarrassing reports about the Sheikh MohammedPrincess Haya split if the second had won.It can’t be the strongest Queen Anne if the second, third and fourth in the betting don’t have a Group One win between them but the compensation is that it’s really competitive. Circus Maximus heads the market, having won the St James’s Palace here last summer and also the Moulin in September. It was interesting that he hung to his left on both occasions and he wouldn’t want to do that from a far-side draw in this straight-mile contest. A straight course is a new test for him and possibly not ideal for a quirky sort whose concentration may not be flawless. Speaking of quirky, Accidental Agent is back, having shocked us with a 33-1 success in this two years back. Last year, he refused to start. Which version of him will we see today? The bookies think they know, as he’s 80-1 in places. Terebellum travelled well and looked classy in landing a Group Two 10 days ago this is her first race against males and also her first at a distance shorter than 10 furlongs. Fox Chairman was a slightly unlucky second in a Group Three here last year and has not been seen since the following month, leaving him plenty to prove. The form of Mohaather’s Greenham win is not entirely convincing, though his stable is hot just now. Duke Of Hazzard was going the right way after blinkers were fitted last summer and he has a useful turn of foot, though Monday’s rain was not ideal for him.Here’s the finish for the first race ...Number 3, Blown By Wind has ditched his jockey at the start ... could be a delay ... he’s back on ... they’re off ... Keyser Soze slowly away with Gifted Master leading in the centre ... three groups spread across the track ... Jack’s Point is also prominent ... Documenting going well ... Motakhayyel goes on to win with Jack’s Point the runner-up.In the absence of the Queen the national anthem will be played each day this week a quarter of an hour before the first race.This is a bit like an old friend, long since disappeared overseas, suddenly dropping in for tea. Killed off in 2015 to make way for the Commonwealth Cup, the much-lamented Buckingham Palace is back for one year only as part of this enhanced Royal Ascot. Quite possibly we will all wonder why we pined for it, as 24-runner handicaps are not the easiest to pick apart.The market has latched onto Daarik, who impressed in scoring at Newcastle 10 days ago, his handicap debut and his first run since being gelded. He’s trained by John Gosden and it’s interesting that Gosden has crowbarred Dettori into the saddle rather than Jim Crowley, the retained first rider to Daarik’s owner, Sheikh Hamdan. The Sheikh evidently missed this race as much as anyone, since he has four runners. Mutamaasik has an obvious chance after four wins on the bounce last year interesting, then, that Crowley is aboard Motakhayyel, whose form chance is less clear but who may have progressed since he was last seen in July. David O’Meara, who trained the most recent winner of this race, fields an interesting pair of runners in the slightly frustrating veteran Firmament and the ex-Irish Shelir, who will surely pop up in a big handicap one day. Glen Shiel was fourth in the handicap here on Champions Day and Monday’s rain was good news for Hollie Doyle’s only mount of the day.It would be about this time we would normally be getting the runners and riders in the Royal Procession Stakes .. this time all we have is the Queen’s broadcast to the racing nation via the Royal Ascot racecard ... and no tips!Sir Michael Stoute 81Aidan O’Brien 70John Gosden 49Mark Johnston 45Saeed bin-Suroor 36Paul Cole 21Mick Channon 18Dermot Weld 17David Elsworth 16Roger Charlton 10James Fanshawe 10William Haggas 10Wesley Ward 10This Royal meeting will have a markedly different feel, in terms of who is training the runners, the coronavirus having dramatically slimmed down the raiding party from Ireland. The Ascot Stakes at the end of today’s card has been won by Irish-trained runners in five of the last six years but this time it will be an all-British affair. Aidan O’Brien has six runners on the opening card, compared to 11 last year, and he will have five tomorrow and just four on Thursday.John Gosden (11 declared for Thursday) looks set to outnumber him for runners over the course of the week, so there’s a case for 7-4 being a fair price for him to be top trainer this week, a feat he has not achieved since 2012. Meanwhile, I believe Darren Bunyan is the only trainer other than O’Brien to be bringing a runner over from Ireland in the first three days of this Royal Ascot. He has Hit The Bid, an outsider in the King’s Stand today. There will be a modest French presence, as Francis Graffard runs two today and Fabrice Chappet has one in the Jersey on Thursday.Top trainer best odds:5-4 O’Brien, 7-4 Gosden, 10-1 Appleby, Johnston, 25-1 Haggas, Stoute, 33-1 Andrew Balding, Richard Hannon, Roger Varian.Interestingly, the Frankie Dettori-ridden horses are the ones being backed on day one with Daarik (1.15), Terebellum (1.50) and Frankly Daring (2.25) the best supported at the meeting so far. If that trio win the first three races the bookies will be running for cover. Right on cue a spokesperson for BettingExpert sent me this: “Frankie is the go to rider for the public and with a huge stay-at-home audience likely to tune in, it’s no surprise to see a more casual audience turn to the jockey they know and love in the search for a Royal Ascot winner. Anyone who fancies him to have a good day is strongly advised to take early prices as despite his latter rides coming on currently less fancied horses, their odds should all collapse if he starts the meeting with a bang.”But will we see his trademark celebration? Dettori told the Mail: “I’m not sure about the flying dismount. It is very hard to jump off a horse when there is nobody in front of you, so at the moment I don’t think I will be jumping off.” I rather suspect TV viewers will get one if he notches a treble!Frankie Dettori 67Ryan Moore 58Jamie Spencer 26William Buick 23Olivier Peslier 16James Doyle 13There might be Classics in which Moore ends up riding the wrong one from his employer’s stable but things tend to go pretty well for him at the Royal meeting. He’s been top jockey here no fewer than eight times, including five times in a row until 2019. That run was ended last year by Dettori, whose seven wins made him top rider in Ascot week for the first time since 2004, when he was a stripling of 33 years. Can he do it again? He might be pushing 50 but he’s got so much ammunition that another title could hardly be a surprise.Meanwhile, other riders struggle to get a look-in. Neither Spencer nor Buick added to their totals last year, when Moore and Dettori won 12 of the 30 races and were also runner-up 10 times between them. Danny Tudhope had a good week, you may remember, with four wins.In case you need reminding, just two female jockeys have ever won at Royal Ascot: Gay Kelleway in 1987 and Hayley Turner last year. Hollie Doyle, Josephine Gordon and Megan Nicholls all have a ride each today.Very few racing scribes (reptiles as the late John McCririck was fond of labelling us) are currently being allowed into racecourses under the Covid-19 restrictions. Indeed, apart from the handful of TV broadcasters there’s only the Racing Post and the Press Association with journalists at the track.

We are running an identical competition on each day of the Royal meeting, up to Friday. And please post your tips or racing-related comments below.The going news from the track this morning is that the course is now officially good-to-soft, following 10mm of rain in thundery showers on Monday evening.“The forecast is for a warm day but this may again trigger some thundery showers later,” Chris Stickels, Ascot’s clerk of the course, said on the track’s Twitter feed a few minutes ago. “The forecast remains similar for the remainder of the week.”The unknown, of course, is how much rain, if any, is going to arrive over the next few days – but at least if it does, we will know about it in minute detail as soon as it appears. And Royal Ascot is never quite as much fun if you are casting nervous glances at the sky every 10 minutes, so perhaps “at home” will prove to be the best place to watch the action after all this year?In early May, the chance that Royal Ascot 2020 would open as scheduled on 16 June was seen as so remote by the backers on Betfair’s betting exchange that around £1,000 was matched on “Yes” on its “Will Racing Go Ahead?” market at about 25-1.Yet just a few weeks later, here we are. Or rather, we aren’t. For the first time in a history which is generally dated to around 1807, the grandstands will be empty as the runners go to post for the opening race just after 1pm today, a moment which was memorably captured by Lerner and Loewe in My Fair Lady (without ever explaining how Rex Harrison managed to evade the bowler-hatted dress-code police and get into the Royal enclosure without a morning suit).Racing behind closed doors is a necessity that the sport will hopefully not have enough time to get fully used to, as without paying spectators, the balance sheet does not even come close to equilibrium. A badge for the Royal enclosure would have cost £125 – which works out as around £4m in revenue before any of them have bought a bottle of champagne or some strawberries. With well over 200,000 tickets for other enclosures too, the drop in income is eye-watering.The only significant source of revenue from this year’s Royal meeting, in fact, will be from betting, and there are six new races – all tricky handicaps – for one year only, while bookmakers will be falling over themselves with special offers and enticements to new customers to try and get some money into their (mainly digital) satchels. Some betting shops started to re-open from yesterday, but with social distancing rules to enforce and many still shut, online is almost certainly the way to go for punters.The good news for backers is that everyone can access the online information hub on going, rainfall and so on, which Ascot has set up for owners who have been denied access to see their horses run for Royal glory. It offers probably the most extensive range of information on track conditions ever provided to the punting public, up to and including the rate at which the course is losing moisture. That should make winners at least a little bit easier to find.The lightning-fast Baattash’s attempt to finally lay his Royal Ascot hoodoo in the King’s Stand Stakes is the feature event on the opening day, since the St James’s Palace Stakes, which normally takes centre stage, has been shifted to Saturday as part of a re-arrangement which you can imagine becoming a permanent legacy of this year’s meeting as it puts three Group Ones on the most popular, closing day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1299827c747983805adafaa09459a97be30ef4/0_316_4628_2777/master/4628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f89746a700adb69fa448c344ca2e2476","title":"leah harvey on small island national theatre andrea levy","story":"As it’s streamed by the National Theatre, the star who plays Hortense in the acclaimed adaptation of Andrea Levy’s novel talks about Britain, Windrush and Black Lives MatterUnfortunately, I never met Andrea Levy, which I’m always going to be sad about. When I did a workshop in October 2018 she was too ill to be there but she was deeply involved in this adaptation. She wanted Rufus Norris to direct it and Helen Edmundson to adapt it.I remember working on that first scene in rehearsals. When it came to the direct address, I had to turn around to speak to the audience. I wasn’t on stage at the time but I knew what it looked like. I turned around and just curled up into a tiny ball on the floor. I felt so exposed. Everyone laughed at the strong physical reaction.Marriage is a disappointment for Hortense, who marries Gilbert out of expediency. and also for Queenie, who marries the emotionally repressed Bernard. Is this a comment on marriage for women in the 1940s and 50s?I’ve always wanted Hortense and Queenie to have a cup of tea together and chat, because they have so much in common. They both get married to men they don’t know or get along with that well. They marry to escape the situation they’re in Hortense marries Gilbert to travel to the ‘Motherland’ and Queenie marries Bernard so she doesn’t have to keep working in a stinking farm. But I think in both marriages they have the power.A central part of Gilbert’s story relates to the West Indian soldiers who fought in the British army during the second world war and then became part of the Windrush generation, postwar. Did the play acquire new meaning for you in the light of the Windrush scandal of 2018? Yes of course. We are playing pretend but the Windrush scandal makes it real. When Shiloh Coke and I first put on our costumes we both said ‘I feel real’. These clothes were what our aunties and grandmothers would have worn. Naturally, it makes you look at your own family and how it affected everybody. My grandmother turned 80 while I was rehearsing: she came to England from St Lucia and is a member of the Windrush generation. I was trying to work her out at the time and as she was giving a speech on her birthday, I thought ‘That’s Hortense!’Jon Driscoll’s projection of rolling ocean waves in the backdrop as well as film footage of people stepping off HMT Empire Windrush is very visually striking. How did it feel to perform against this backdrop?I didn’t see much of it until I watched the NT Live version of the play and then I thought ‘Wow, I’ve been missing out on so much!’ The sea is actually the Caribbean – they went there and filmed it.Do you think this drama has gained greater resonance in the light of the global protests and recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement?I think it would always have meant something very big to a lot of different people, but now it bears even more resonance. It’s important we share these stories, full stop, but to make the play available – and globally available – for one week at this moment could be so big but overwhelming to think about. Even if there’s one person on the other side of the argument who gains some empathy or a different perspective by watching it, then it’s done something good.Bernard Bligh is openly and vehemently racist to Gilbert, who experiences a lot of hostility and aggression in Britain and says that “this country is full of people like Mr Bligh”. How far do you think we have come since then?Obviously I feel we have progressed as a country. The fact that I’m even on that stage and this story is being told in one of the biggest theatres in the country means we have progressed. Unfortunately, as we saw in the news over the weekend, there are still people who are the products of a racist system.I was talking to my mum and she said that a thing that is so ingrained in society and is so big worldwide needs a big energy to change it. Something like this has not happened worldwide before and so everyone can see it on social media. Doing this play is a contribution to sharing the historical story of why our country is the way that it is.How has lockdown affected your professional and personal life?I was in Ireland, filming Foundation, a new TV show for Apple TV. I play a lead role, which is really exciting, but I had to fly back home in the middle of it. I have also been going through heartbreak. Ever since drama school, I have been working consistently and done character development on all the people I’ve played. Now I’m using this time to do some character development on myself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8eeb2e2630caf84a3213515ab1832599211745c/0_221_3326_1997/master/3326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c340f4d51d371187261a33273591d88a","title":"apple pay and app store face investigation over competition rules","story":"EU will look at Apple practices after years of criticism from competitors and regulatorsApple Pay and the iOS App Store are being investigated over potential breaches of European competition rules, the EU’s competition commission announced on Tuesday.The two investigations come after years of growing criticism of Apple’s practices from competitors including Spotify and regulators in the US and EU.Spotify in particular has regularly cited the restrictions as limiting the company’s ability to compete with Apple’s music service, since the company is forced to either pay Apple a large share of its revenue or risk losing customers who can’t work out how to pay. In May 2019, the company filed a formal complaint against Apple.Apple has long maintained that the restrictions are crucial for providing security and privacy to its users. “We developed the App Store with two goals in mind,” the company said in a statement: “That it be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for entrepreneurs and developers. We’re deeply proud of the countless developers who’ve innovated and found success through our platform.“And as we’ve grown together, we’ve continued to deliver innovative new services – like Apple Pay – that provide the very best customer experience while meeting industry-leading standards for privacy and security.”Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: “Mobile applications have fundamentally changed the way we access content. Apple sets the rules for the distribution of apps to users of iPhones and iPads. It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices.“We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for example with its music streaming service, Apple Music, or with Apple Books. I have therefore decided to take a close look at Apple’s App Store rules and their compliance with EU competition rules.”Apple Pay, the company’s contactless and online payment service, is being investigated for a different set of restrictions that ensure the service is the only option for iPhone and iPad users wanting to make contactless payments. Also under investigation is the tight integration with the company’s operating systems, which ensures that Apple Pay can provide a smoother experience for online sales than competing payment platforms.“It appears that Apple sets the conditions on how Apple Pay should be used in merchants’ apps and websites,” Vestager said. “It also reserves the ‘tap and go’ functionality of iPhones to Apple Pay. It is important that Apple’s measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices.”In a statement, Apple responded: “It’s disappointing the European commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don’t want to play by the same rules as everyone else. We don’t think that’s right – we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed.“At the end of the day, our goal is simple: for our customers to have access to the best app or service of their choice, in a safe and secure environment. We welcome the opportunity to show the European commission all we’ve done to make that goal a reality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a57c77c4ab02db95abaac0a2f5b87b20bf02fb/220_0_2867_1722/master/2867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=635b31f861b2d5aa03f377645364002f","title":"10 best books novels set in india indian writers","story":"Tired of narratives that obsess over spices, colours and cows on the road?

Where the authors have used the old names of cities, I’ve done so too, in order to convey the duality of their nature: having spent a couple of years living in Madras as a child, I know the familiar emotions and memories that the name conjures up, whereas Chennai is a completely different city to me.“Return is never the experience you hope for,” Doshi begins, setting the tone for the story of Grace, a young woman coming back to Madras after her mother’s death, to find she has inherited a pink beach house down the coast – and a sister with Down’s syndrome. Small Days and Nights is a compelling story about family, which follows Grace as she slips between Madras, Kodaikanal and Paramankeni, her needs, wants and urges changing with her surroundings as she tries to reconcile desire with duty. A poet, dancer and novelist, Doshi centres the female body in all her work, and it’s through the weight of Grace’s legs, or the lightness in her bones that we, too, feel the effects of the “womb noise” of the sea in Paramankeni, the whiplash of Kodaikanal rain that “smells of sex”, and the dreamy transitional city of Madras, where the trees look weak and hungover.With characteristic brazenness, Thayil opens with a dedication to HCV – the hepatitis C virus that he contracted while sharing needles and injecting government morphine in the 1980s. It’s followed by a languorous six-page sentence that unfurls like smoke from a pipe – a prelude to a powerhouse of a novel about Bombay’s old opium dens. Built from brutality and grouted together with beauty, Narcopolis begins as a homage to a city of harmony and acceptance, celebrating Bombay as the hero of the story – a sanctuary for Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians – then morphs into an epitaph of a city “which obliterated its own history by changing its name and surgically altering its face”.Shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2012, Thayil refuses to use “Mumbai”, a name that was forced upon its residents by the far-right Hindu Shiv Sena party, and his affection for his former home makes this a potent love letter to the island city and its dead.Like a succession of quick slaps across the face, the opening lines of each story of this debut collection make you sit up and take full notice. Parachuting the reader straight in through low-hanging quilts of cloud, Pariat drops us between the plump tea bushes in and around the hill station of Shillong, where it’s cold and damp and mists swirl with the supernatural. Here, in the furthest reaches of India’s north-eastern fingertips, we learn about Khasi politics and culture, but always with a sense of unease – where the night is “slashed by lightning”, “knifed with light”, and the sky “the colour of razor blades”. Beginning with the days of British rule and stretching up to a modern-day marital infidelity, each of the 15 stories is written in seamless prose that doesn’t jolt or falter through italics or apologetic explanations of bilati, doh thli and jadoh. If you don’t know their meanings it’s up to you to look them up.Adiga upset many middle-class Indians when The White Tiger hit their bookshelves like a sledgehammer, winning him the Booker prize. Written from the perspective of Balram, the son of a rickshaw puller, the book is a series of letters that he writes feverishly, but never sends, to the soon-to-be-visiting Chinese premier, documenting his wily ascent from tea boy to wealthy entrepreneur. Through his sharp-eyed, witty and frenzied descriptions, Adiga doesn’t just highlight the brutal injustices and corruption of Indian society but slaps them across the paper in broad, bushy strokes. Although the book was released in 2008, one line stands out for its relevance today: “One fact about India is that you can take almost anything that you hear about the country from the prime minister and turn it upside down and then you will have the truth about that thing.”Not many novels are set in Bangalore, the more subdued sibling of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. However, here we find Shalini, a 24-year-old numbed by the banality of her privileged life in the Garden City. Since her mother’s death, three years earlier, she’s lived in limbo, unable to commit to anything and plagued by a memory from her childhood of a Kashmiri man appearing twice at their garden gate. In a feverish moment she decides to leave home to find him, swapping her weekend trips to Bali, and beer-sticky house parties, for the blue-grey mountains of Kashmir, where the air is tinged with the “medicinal sharpness of pine sap” and waterfalls churn to a “filigreed white froth”.Vijay’s beautiful debut leaps back and forth while shining a light on a politically fractious region from the perspective of a civilian – that, too, a single woman traipsing the length of India alone in search of the unknown.The only non-fiction on this list, this collection strings together nine stories gathered along the Indian coast, from Bengal to Gujarat. With fish as the starting point, Subramanian examines its role in food, medicine, culture and religion by talking to everyone he meets on his haphazard travels, from Goan fishermen and priests, to Kolkata hotel chefs and a faith-healing family in Hyderabad. Dense and rigorous journalism, the writing ignites when the author sits down to eat: whether he’s tasting raw fish podi made from powdered mackerel that “races to the back of the throat and proceeds to set your tonsils on fire”, or sampling toddy-shop food that is typically “kicked into a high orbit of spice”, it’s hard to resist the urge to follow in his footsteps.The first Indian woman to win the Booker, Roy caused a storm in the literary world when her lyrical debut was published in 1997, spurring a number of authors who tried to emulate her style, while others decried her success – the sure sign of a good book.Set in Kerala – known as God’s Own Country, for its vast backwaters, bent palms and cool greenery – the book opens in the brooding heat of May, when bananas ripen, jackfruits burst and crows devour the mangoes, before the monsoon breaks, tiny fish appear in puddles and “bullfrogs cruise for mates”. Tragedy has destroyed a family, and after many years an estranged pair of twins are reuniting where it all began.Scattering capital letters and pulling and playing around with language, Roy paints a vivid picture of Indian politics, the cruelty of caste, and the “small things” that keep us afloat.A hulking beast of a book, this delicious thriller sinks deep into Bombay’s criminal underworld, as Sikh cop Sartaj Singh goes after the infamous gangster Ganesh Gaitonde. Packed with policemen stroking splendid handlebar moustaches, lapdogs being hurled from balconies, and villains with bulging, bloodshot eyes, Sacred Games is a brilliant exploration of politics, history and corruption. For the unfamiliar, it is also a swift education in the peculiarities of the city’s various districts, like Bandra, Tardeo and Dadar, offering peeks into the homes of Bombay’s rich, “30,000 square feet of Italian marble floors tied together with intercoms”, and the poor – where residents have no choice but to “let their little daughters squat to make a mess exactly where their sons played”.Published in 2006, the novel is now a wildly popular series on Netflix.Few novels begin with the sheer horror of this one: a horror that rises from the belly, making you gasp and catch your breath before turning the page.It is Calcutta in the 1960s and the wealthy son of a paper-mill owner has abandoned the Ghosh family to join a Maoist rebellion, helping farmers to fight their landlords while his Tolstoyan array of relatives deal with their own multitude of tribulations. Shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2014, this is a tome of extraordinary reach and richness, written by an author whose gift lies not just in his ability to imagine the lives of others but to embody them: he details how those starving outside a luxury hotel will hunt for a “stub of banana” left in a peel, while in the affluent world a whole family is “caught up in a song-and-dance” in an attempt to get food down a fussy toddler.If we’re being technical, this 2006 Booker prize-winner oscillates between the Himalayan foothills of West Bengal and the basement kitchens of New York, following the lives of a judge, his granddaughter, her maths tutor, their cook and his son. But the Indian backdrop could almost be a sixth character, where the trees are “moss-slung giants, bunioned and misshapen”, and Mount Kanchenjunga looms with a “wizard phosphorescence”. Desai takes on a mammoth endeavour in linking these seemingly disparate lives, but does so with panache while also being incredibly funny. She exposes one generation suffering from a crisis of identity owing to colonialism – Judge Jemubhai Patel eating chapatis with a knife and fork – and another generation still looking to the west for a better future… while sharing a bed in shifts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b1fb6cb93a40d93a614379d7af53e3e9df7d61d/0_199_5964_3578/master/5964.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac74cf236bf83b7a36838e0be9d33f1 980w","title":"trans people voting november election","story":"Difficulties in obtaining identification mean large numbers of potential voters are vulnerable to disenfranchisementWhen My-Linh moved from Texas to New York, they knew they wanted to vote in elections without risk of discrimination against their non-binary identity. But the only options on the form to get a state ID are male and female.“The system set in place is very unfair, and it doesn’t give any opportunity for people who have intersectional identities to be able to feel comfortable to identify themselves,” says My-Linh.Few states in the US have passed a law requiring voting registration forms to include an X or unspecified option for anyone who doesn’t identify as male or female. Only 18 states and Washington DC have that option when getting a driver’s license – neither Texas nor New York, where My-Linh would vote, do.For non-binary people, as well as the transgender community as a whole, barriers to getting an appropriate ID leave hundreds of thousands people vulnerable to disenfranchisement.The 2015 US Trans Survey also found that a third of the people who showed ID which didn’t match their gender presentation faced negative results such as harassment or even assault – something that can discourage transgender and non-binary people from casting a ballot.Allison, a trans femme who had recently moved to California before the November 2016 elections, had not changed her gender marker due to the high cost of the paperwork. Though she had registered online, poll workers asked for her ID, citing their reasoning being it was her first time voting in the state which does not have strict voter ID laws. She only received a provisional ballot, meaning her vote may not have counted.“Having to have photo identification to show up at the polls disproportionately affects our transgender populations,” says Arli Christensen, Campaign Strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on trans justice issues. “For transgender folks, it is often very difficult to get an ID that accurately reflects who they are, has a legal name that corresponds with who they are, and has a gender marker that matches who they are.”The high rate of inaccurate IDs doesn’t come from a lack of trying. Trans people face a complicated and expensive ordeal involving legal fees, a potential need to publish their name in the newspaper – thus outing them – and sharing invasive medical documentation. Most states, including New York, require publishing changed names in a newspaper for creditors and other interested parties. In some states gender markers can’t be changed without proof of surgery.Earlier this year a 28-year-old transgender woman sued North Carolina and Mecklenburg county election officials after facing discrimination while voting last November. While the state doesn’t require identification for voting, the woman, who has lived as a female since the age of 14, was asked to present her ID. When asked why it was required, she said the precinct judge said: “Because your face doesn’t match your name.”She was finally allowed to vote after over an hour but was emotionally shaken up.“These voter ID laws are a solution in search of a problem and all they really do in the end is make it harder for people to vote,” says Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director for policy and action at the National Center for Transgender Equality and a transgender man.Heng-Lehtinen was out as a transgender man and going by Rodrigo for five years before he could legally change his name. “Everyone knew me as that. That’s how I was recognized in the world, with my job, my friends, my family, everyone. But there was no government document that reflected that,” he says.He had to go through a DMV and Social Security Administration in California before eventually reaching the California court system. The cost was about $450. Something he stresses is “extremely out of reach for many transgender people who disproportionately are more likely to work low-wage jobs”.“Transgender people are disproportionately subject to discrimination, so it’s harder for us to find a job and we’re put into more desperate situations. A lot of transgender people are doing sex work or other jobs like that just to get by, which then makes us more likely to be in prison,” says Heng-Lehtinen.With the presidential election less than six months away, advocates are hoping that some measures can be taken to make it easier for transgender and non-binary people to vote. David advocated for changing state laws to make it easier to change voter forms and IDs. Christensen said poll workers should be educated about IDs so they don’t bar someone from voting, and hoped that a national conversation would continue.“If there’s a gender discrepancy between your ID and the way you walk through the world, that is not a reason to be denied a ballot,” said Christensen. “We need to make sure that as a community, as a society, we understand trans people. Our democracy is strongest when all people have access to vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef2ba5cc4bad08c54a2a0288813af2b4768881/0_21_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6834bf7929a48df6f5d1dfe73ca881cd","title":"universities campus life us college coronavirus","story":"Experts say coronavirus outbreaks are almost inevitable given the close-knit nature of college life, and many social events might not returnWhen Nicole Spriggs-Moye of Washington DC imagined what her first year in college at Louisiana State University would look like, she imagined meeting new people and exploring new places. She envisioned bonding with her new roommate and joining the Black Student Union and student radio station. She planned to find mentors in her professors, who would teach her mass communication and pre-law.But for Spriggs-Moye and thousands of other incoming college students, reality has set in that college will be very different in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.“A lot of events and things that really make college college might not happen: football games, certain freshman-week events, all that type of stuff,” Spriggs-Moye said. “If there will even be a second semester and we’ll get second-semester events is up in the air.”Colleges and universities, in which there are over 4,000 across the US, have been undergoing a reckoning of how college can still be “college” – a life of social activities, living with roommates, giant lecture classes, sports games and dorm parties – in the midst of a pandemic where social distancing is key to preventing an outbreak.Most institutions in the country closed their doors to students and faculty as shutdown orders came in March, moving all classes online to “Zoom University” – the term students have used to refer to their online learning experience.Now that summer has arrived, college and university administrators are desperately trying to plan how a campus can function during a pandemic.Public health officials say coronavirus cases on campus are pretty much inevitable, given the close-knit nature of university life.“We should assume for planning purposes that there will be people on campus with Covid-19 infections, regardless of what precautions are taken,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, during testimony to Congress earlier this month.In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidelines for colleges and universities to follow as they start to open up. The CDC broadly recommends institutions partner with local health officials to implement contact tracing and testing. If a Covid-19 case pops up, classes may have to be temporarily suspended, and students may need to move to temporary housing.Despite the risks of new infections and outbreaks, many institutions have announced they will invite students back to campus in the fall – with some major caveats.Multiple institutions have said they are looking into allowing only a portion of the student population to be on campus at once. Stanford University in California plans to allow two classes of undergraduates on campus per quarter. The freshman class will be on campus in the fall, while the senior class will be on campus in the spring. New York University is planning a “mixed mode” of learning, allowing students to participate in either in-person or online classes.Other schools are looking to get rid of breaks to ensure students do not leave campus and return with the virus. The University of Notre Dame in Indiana is planning to start its fall semester three weeks earlier than scheduled to allow classes to end before Thanksgiving. LSU said it may transition to online learning after Thanksgiving and into finals.Although it may be easier for institutions to hold classes solely online, campuses are seen by students, faculty and administrators alike as essential elements of learning, and a key part of the college experience.Sydney Hayes, who will be a senior at Notre Dame in the fall, wants to spend her senior year on campus to enjoy the friendships and connections she has built over the last three years.“Part of the reason why people go to Notre Dame especially is to feel like they’re home. That’s what Notre Dame preaches – it’s like your home away from home,” Hayes said. “I feel a lot of us feel misplaced and displaced right now being at home and not having our friends, peers and professors close with us.”For Rebecca Mena, who will be a senior at California State University Fullerton next year, being on campus also means she can find quiet places to get work done. Doing online classes at home has been difficult with her two younger siblings aged four and 10.“My focus can be broken pretty easily. That’s why I preferred going on campus and studying anywhere instead of my room. I’d be at the student union, be at Starbucks. No one’s there to bother, you’re just alone with you and your thoughts,” Mena said.“In contrast to being here at home with everyone yelling, noises happening randomly. I don’t even have a desk to work on,” Mena said. “I’m going into debt to succeed, not work on my bed.”Experts say the pandemic will encourage many students to reflect on whether a pared-back campus experience is worth the high cost of college, especially when unemployment is at a record high and many families are finding themselves with less money. One survey found that as many as one in six high school seniors who had proposed to attend college in the fall changed their plans because of the pandemic.“Wealthier students will have more resources during this pandemic. They will have more choices to hold out for that classic college experience that they hope to have. Students who are not from wealthy families will have fewer options,” said Kristen Renn, a professor of higher, adult and lifelong education at Michigan State University.States will also probably tighten funding in the near future thanks to pandemic spending the worsening economy. Public colleges and universities that rely on state funding are likely to see their own budgets slashed. After the Great Recession, nearly all states cut their budgets for public institutions. With less money, schools increase the cost for students, increasing the likelihood of student debt, already $1.5tn in the US.Private institutions will also see a decrease in enrollment, especially without international students, who bring in $2.5bn in tuition a year. Some colleges could lose up to $100m in revenue this year with the drop in international and domestic student enrollment. Already dozens of schools have furloughed faculty members and instituted hiring freezes.In the $2.2tn Cares Act –the relief package Congress passed in March – $14bn was allocated to help colleges and universities. Institutions were instructed to give at least half of the money to students in the form of emergency grants, though the Department of Education has barred millions of undocumented and international students from receiving any of the aid.Though institutions were told to report how they are spending the money they received from the Cares Act, “we don’t know very much about how colleges are spending that money,” said James Kvaal, president of the Institute for College Access \u0026amp Success and a former Obama White House official. He said it was clear schools and their students will need more aid in the future.“Congress needs to offer much more relief to colleges and universities, and unlike the Cares Act, it should come with some expectations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9c2a6699500e3b01e3fa2000ae3a005c24bb73/0_126_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea85962d6c47c16385dba59578c0dbe","title":"dismay over adviser chosen set up uk race inequality commission munira mirza","story":"Munira Mirza has doubted existence of institutional racism and criticised ‘culture of grievance’The new government commission on racial inequalities is being set up by a No 10 adviser who has cast doubt on the existence of institutional racism and condemned previous inquiries for fostering a “culture of grievance”, it has emerged.Munira Mirza, the head of the No 10 policy unit, is leading much of the work to form the commission on race and ethnic disparities announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday after the global wave of Black Lives Matter protests, the  has been told.It is understood that Mirza has said she hopes to recruit Trevor Phillips as part of the commission. Phillips, a former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, would be a controversial choice, having previously referred to UK Muslims as being “a nation within a nation”.When Phillips was named as playing a role in a Public Health England inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, it prompted condemnation from campaigners.The revelation of Mirza’s role was met with dismay from experts and MPs. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, whose own review on inequalities in the judicial system was criticised by Mirza, tweeted on Monday evening that the appointment “further undermines” Johnson’s race commission.The Labour MP added: “My review was welcomed by all parties: Corbyn, Cameron and May. But Munira Mirza went out of her way to attack it. Johnson isn’t listening to #BlackLivesMatter. He’s trying to wage a culture war.”The Institute of Race Relations thinktank said it would be hard to have confidence in the commission’s outcomes.“Any enquiry into inequality has to acknowledge structural and systemic factors. Munira Mirza’s previous comments describe a ‘grievance culture’ within the anti-racist field and she has previously argued that institutional racism is ‘a perception more than a reality’,” a spokesperson said. “It is difficult to have any confidence in policy recommendations from someone who denies the existence of the very structures that produce the social inequalities experienced by black communities.”The Labour MP Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said: “A new race equalities commission led by Munira Mirza is dead on arrival. She has never believed in institutional racism.”The government commission, which was revealed in a Daily  column by Johnson, was also condemned by Labour as overly vague, “written on the back of a fag packet” and adding delay rather than urgency.Mirza, who is also understood to be leading efforts to recruit commission members, has been an outspoken critic of previous government attempts to tackle structural factors behind racial inequality.She condemned an audit of racial inequalities in public services commissioned by Theresa May, which No 10 say will form part of the basis of the new commission. Writing for the Spectator in 2017, Mirza said the audit showed how “anti-racism is becoming weaponised across the political spectrum”.In the same article, Mirza criticised two other reports which Johnson’s government has promised to act on: the one written by Lammy when he was a backbencher, and another on unequal pay among ethnic groups. Mirza said both showed “wrongheaded thinking about race”.Dawn Butler, a Labour MP and former equalities minister, said Mirza’s role “undermines its credibility from the very outset by appointing someone who stands by Johnson’s racist comments, rejected the Lammy review, saying ‘institutional racism’ is ‘a perception more than a reality’, and opposed Theresa May’s very own racial disparities audit.“I am tired of fighting the government on this issue. The only review needed is a review into all the past consultations and reviews as well as their failure to implement over 200 prior recommendations.”Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, a leading race equality thinktank, said the prime minister bore ultimate responsibility for the commission, however. “There are several members in this government who were not strong supporters of Theresa May’s race disparity audit including Munira Mirza, Boris Johnson’s own adviser in No 10. But we must remember that it’s the prime minister who’s in charge here and it’s the prime minister who needs to be held accountable for his words and actions, not his advisers.”Johnson announced the commission in two lines of an article for Monday’s  otherwise devoted to arguing against the removal of historical statues and condemning protesters, and in brief TV comments that referenced a desire to end “the sense of victimisation”, which were described by critics as unhelpful.No 10 said later it would “look at wider inequalities, including issues faced by working-class white boys in schools, for example”. Its remit and members will be announced in due course, a spokesman said. The report, which will also examine some non-racial inequalities, will be completed by the end of the year.Speaking to the BBC on Monday morning, Lammy condemned the plan as overly vague, and a way to delay implementing recommendations from his and other reports. “It’s because this was written on the back of a fag packet yesterday, to assuage the BLM protests,” he said. “Get on with the action. Legislate. Move. You’re in government – do something.”Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote and chair of the government’s Race Disparity Unit advisory group, also warned the commission must implement existing recommendations rather than going over old ground.“This should not be a fact-finding inquiry,” said the crossbench peer. “This should be framing a comprehensive action plan to reform those key areas that Boris Johnson has acknowledged that have systemic racism.”Mirza, a one-time supporter of the Revolutionary Communist party, who spent eight years as Johnson’s deputy mayor for culture in London, has been an outspoken critic of anti-racism and what she called “its culture of grievance”.In the Spectator article, she took issue with Lammy’s review into the justice system by saying that in some ways, people from BAME backgrounds have “more favourable treatment compared with whites”.In a blogpost from 2018, Mirza argued that injustices were only treated seriously if there was “a social justice angle that can be ined (or manufactured)”.These views chime to an extent with Johnson’s attempts to reframe the debate about the mass protests after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis in terms of opposition to removing statues, and his view that more should be done to talk up positive experiences about race.“What I feel most strongly is that there are so many positive stories that are not being heard,” he told reporters in Downing Street on Monday. “Things really are changing. You’re seeing young black kids now doing better in some of the most difficult subjects in school than they were ever before, more going to top universities.”Addressing MPs in the Commons, the home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed the government was backing a plan by some Tory MPs for a new law imposing heavier prison sentences on protesters who vandalise war memorials, after a statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was defaced during a BLM demonstration.This prompted counter-demonstrators, including those from far-right groups, to protest in Westminster on Saturday. Patel said about 2,000 “racist and far-right hooligans” attended, some of whom threw smoke bombs at police.Patel said more than 210,000 people attended demonstrations across the country over the weekend at about 160 protests.Asked about Mirza’s role and the concerns around it, a No 10 source highlighted Johnson’s comments on Tuesday about the value of the commission’s work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205bc504825c4cf8e771c994e0f05d837e654d60/0_93_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0997edd05a3a61b6b807d2efdac20a3","title":"coronavirus vaccine trial by imperial college london begins","story":"Professor says early vaccines may not stop virus being contracted but prevent recipients developing severe Covid-19 illnessResearchers at Imperial College London will this week begin clinical trials of a possible coronavirus vaccine in 300 people.The healthy participants, aged between 18 and 70, will all receive two doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks, and the hopes is that tests could then move on to 6,000 volunteers if there is an effective immune response.Rather than giving people a weakened form of the illness, the Imperial vaccine instead uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the “novel coronavirus” responsible for the pandemic.Robin Shattock, the Imperial College London professor leading its development, has told Bloomberg that early protective vaccines might not completely stop a person contracting the virus. “Is that protection against infection? Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.”When injected, the Imperial experimental vaccine instructs muscle cells to produce virus proteins to protect against future infection. In animal tests, the vaccine was shown to be safe and showed “encouraging signs of an effective immune response”, Shattock’s team said.The research has been funded by £41m from the UK government, as well as £5m of other donations, and comes after a separate vaccine from experts at Oxford University started undergoing human clinical trials.With Press Association and Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d9c4e991f2d5536d0e87a6689007b3b087399f/0_357_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=781a4a14aeccb00010afdaf253d613ff","title":"new zealand records first new covid 19 cases after women arrive from uk carrying virus","story":"Pair drove nearly 650km to visit dying parent after being released early from quarantine but officials claim public were not at riskNew Zealand has recorded its first new cases of coronavirus for 24 days after two women who arrived in the country from Britain were found to be infected.The pair were released early from government quarantine and permitted to drive from the city of Auckland to Wellington, the capital – nearly 650km away – before being diagnosed or even tested, health officials said.Their trip was an approved exemption from the mandatory isolation period for new arrivals to the country in order to visit a dying parent. The women had “done everything right” and had not put other members of the public at risk, said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health, on Tuesday.But the news of the women’s travel forced the government to suspend its policy of granting compassionate exemptions to its quarantine rules.“It will only be reinstated once the government has confidence in the system,” said David Clark, the health minister, in a statement. Officials had already announced that no one in future would be permitted to leave quarantine facilities without a negative Covid-19 test, as the women had.After both women tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, one reported that in hindsight she had been experiencing symptoms, but had attributed them to a pre-existing medical condition.The pair mark New Zealand’s first new cases of Covid-19 for more than three weeks, and were diagnosed one week after the last known case in the country had recovered.The discovery of the new cases came one week after all domestic restrictions on the country were lifted, with Bloomfield warning at the time that more cases of the virus would inevitably arise as people infected with it crossed the border.The women – one aged in her 30s and the other in her 40s – had arrived in Auckland on a flight from the UK via Brisbane, Australia, on 7 June, Bloomfield said. All new arrivals to the country – only New Zealanders, their families, and essential workers are currently permitted to cross the border – are required to spend two weeks in managed isolation at a hotel.But six days after the women arrived, Bloomfield said they travelled from Auckland to Wellington “in a private vehicle” after they were granted a compassionate exemption to do so and made a safety plan with officials. They had not been tested for Covid-19 at the time.The pair had made the drive of approximately eight hours without refuelling their vehicle or disembarking for any reason, including to use public toilets, he said.“They had no contact with anybody else during that trip,” added Bloomfield.He was “not nervous” that the women had infected anyone else, adding that they would now remain in self-isolation with a relative in Wellington. Those permitted to leave the government-run isolation hotels on compassionate grounds are allowed to grieve with their families – but not to attend funerals.All those on the women’s Air New Zealand flight to Brisbane, including crew, as well as staff and guests at the Novotel Ellerslie hotel in Auckland – where they were initially in quarantine – including staff, would be tested and isolated.A guest at the same hotel – who was also in quarantine – told Television New Zealand that she had not been tested before she left the facility. Those in quarantine are meant to receive Covid-19 swabs on the third and 12th days of their 14-day isolation period. “I have asked the Director General to consider if there are any other measures we can put in place to strengthen our health protections at the border,” Clark, the health minister, said.But the women who were later diagnosed “did everything that was asked of them,” Bloomfield said, and it was “not surprising” that cases of the virus had entered New Zealand from the UK, where “active infections” remained.“We should not be complacent, we need to remain vigilant,” Bloomfield said. “There is a pandemic raging outside our shores.”The country has recorded less than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 22 deaths, after a strict and early national lockdown which has drawn praise for Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db022be58f5d9d7213ca0a604909ac1a0a2ce041/0_337_3333_1999/master/3333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaf25e63bed0e079c76cfb7d845f3cfc","title":"saudi led coalition forces in yemen taken off un rights blacklist","story":"Decision taken despite United Nations finding coalition killed hundreds of children last yearThe UN has removed the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen’s war from an annual blacklist of parties violating children’s rights, despite the fact its own investigators found the coalition killed or injured hundreds of children last year.Coalition operations killed or injured 222 children in Yemen in 2019, Guterres wrote in his report to the UN’s security council, but the toll had fallen since an agreement signed last March.The coalition’s Yemeni government partners were found to be responsible for 96 child casualties, and the Houthi rebel movement, against which both are fighting, was responsible for 313. Both the Houthis and Yemeni government forces remain on the blacklist.The move was met with anger from campaigners who said the coalition’s removal from the report leaves Yemeni children vulnerable to future attacks.In a statement, Human Rights Watch said the decision “ignored the UN’s own evidence of continued grave violations against children”.Inger Ashing, of Save the Children, called the decision “shocking”.3m people forced to flee their homes.85,000 -\u0026nbsp Save the Children estimate that this number of children under the age of 5 may have died through hunger and malnutrition.1m cases of cholera in 2017, the largest outbreak of the disease in recent history. 2,200 people died during it. A resurgence of the disease saw more than 137,000 suspected cases and almost 300 deaths in the first three months of 2019.Over 91,600 fatalities since the conflict started in 2015, as measured by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project.19,990 recorded air raids since the conflict began\u0026nbsp£770m - the amount of foreign aid given by Britain in food, medicines and other assistance to civilians over the last half a decade.£6.2bn - the amount of money Britain has earned in the same period selling arms to the Saudis and their coalition partners.Countries and parties are listed in the annual report on children in conflict zones for offences including killing, injuring or abducting children, recruiting child soldiers, denying aid access and targeting schools and hospitals.Those listed are not subject to action: the UN instead uses the “name and shame” tactic to push parties to take steps to limit violations of children’s rights.Saudi Arabia was first included on the blacklist in 2016, but the decision was reversed after the country threatened to cut off funding to UN programmes. The following year, the coalition was placed in a sub-section of the report created for those making efforts to avoid deaths of children. It remained there in 2018 and 2019.The secretary general’s envoy for children and armed conflict, Virginia Gamba, said the UN had come “under no pressure” from Riyadh this year and that the removal from the list was based on data.The coalition will be subject to a further year of monitoring and “any failure” to further decrease child casualties would result in it being listed again in 2021, Guterres added.Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis forced the Yemeni president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee to neighbouring Saudi Arabia in 2014. The war escalated in 2015 after the Saudi-led coalition intervened in a bid to restore his government.Both the coalition and western governments who supply it with arms have been repeatedly criticised by rights groups and conflict monitors for bombing campaigns that have hit schools, health facilities, funeral gatherings and wedding parties.The UN estimates the combined death toll in Yemen’s war from fighting and diseases such as malnutrition and cholera is 230,000 people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6e2a5ff8e8eab2f51030a44f69015f16db5dc0/0_0_4668_2801/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cd0a026d696fbb4112f54060056dc5f","title":"slipper revolution lukashenkos reign under pressure in belarus","story":"After decades in power, a bungled Covid-19 response has triggered a genuine electoral challengeViktor Babariko, an outspoken ex-banker, embodies elite discontent with Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko and his 26 years at the head of Europe’s most authoritarian state.After decades out of politics, Babariko says he decided to mount a challenge and run for president this year both to oppose economic integration with Russia and because of the “totally irresponsible” handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Lukashenko refused to impose a lockdown, claimed that drinking vodka would keep the virus at bay and went ahead with a 9 May Victory Day parade involving thousands of soldiers and elderly war veterans.The country currently has 54,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – significantly more than the 29,700 in neighbouring Poland, which has four times its population.“The government has lost touch with reality. The response to Covid-19 was absolute evidence of that,” Babariko said in an interview. “They think that the Belarus that has lived so quietly and meekly for the last 26 years will continue. But the country that they think still exists is gone.”There are numerous factors for the discontent: a faltering economy, the bungled response to coronavirus, the growing reach of criticism through social media, an increasingly confident civil society – and exhaustion with a government that seems to have run out of ideas.“It became an explosive cocktail,” said Valeriya Kostyugova, the editor of the Minsk-based Nashe Mnenie, noting that coronavirus had helped bring the crisis to a head. “The focus turned considerably to the elections and to hopes of somehow getting rid of Lukashenko and his government system.”Among the usual run of puppet candidates who represent little threat to Lukashenko, real challengers have appeared. Establishment candidates such as Babariko and Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, indicate cracks in the elite. Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular YouTuber with more than 235,000 subscribers, attracted thousands of Belarusians to events to collect signatures for his campaign under an anti-corruption slogan of “stop the cockroach”.Many supporters brought slippers, the preferred weapon to kill household pests, at Tikhanovsky’s suggestion. Some media have dubbed it the “slipper revolution”.Opinion polling is severely limited by the government but thousands have stood in mile-long queues to endorse the candidates, a political spectacle that observers say is unprecedented. “Lukashenko has managed to frustrate and irritate a lot of social groups,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based political analyst, noting that the groundswell of opposition had helped expose the “myth” of Lukashenko’s popularity. “It’s a street protest but it’s also this middle-class drift into politics where people who never were political are now joining.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tikhanovsky, with an appeal to regional and working-class voters who may have previously supported Lukashenko, was arrested first. On Thursday, he was charged with violating public order and assaulting police at a rally to collect signatures in the city of Grodno, and may face up to three years in prison. Observers say he will likely be held until after the 9 August elections.“When he called and said he was going to run … I remember I replied ‘Sergei, you know how the presidential elections are going to end? In prison,’” said Alexander Kabanov, a blogger and activist who also serves as press secretary for the campaign.Tikhanovskay’s wife, Svetlana, has said she will try to register as a candidate but cancelled some events this week, saying in a video address that she was concerned about “provocations”.Lukashenko appears to be considering a larger crackdown. On the same day, investigators raided Babariko’s former bank, Belgazprombank, as well as several other connected businesses.“It’s touched clients. It’s touched my friends,” said Babariko. “This is a broad political persecution.”On Friday, MolaMola, a popular crowdfunding platform co-founded by Babariko’s son, had its operations blocked. The platform had been instrumental in helping raise money for doctors and anti-coronavirus efforts, and the move against it appeared to target a crucial platform for civil activism.Lukashenko has declared Belarus will not have a revolution and said that the upstart campaigns were being funded by Russian oligarchs, in what seemed a veiled reference to Babariko’s former employer. Belgazprombank is the local arm of Russia’s Gazprombank.“I see everything. The main things is not to worry,” Lukashenko told his elections chief in a meeting last week. “There will be no coup in this country. Nor will there be a Maidan,” he added, referring to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine.Analysts said Lukashenko’s attempts to normalise relations with the west, particularly during a period of tensions with Russia, which is putting pressure on Minsk to integrate the two countries in a “unified state”, could temper a potential crackdown, but that his desire for political survival would always come first.Babariko has cautiously avoided calls to protest but says they may break out “if the people feel deceived”, recalling the experiences of Czechoslovakia and Romania."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e995f2ab2e635127181319e0817f0b43b8eddd6a/513_1529_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990e6bad8c163a7e3b2bdb6908166613","title":"color is not a new york black lives matter street art in pictures","story":"Across the US, artists have responded to the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests with impactful and urgent work.

However, he said keeping people 2m apart was tougher for live performances and theaters “so that’s going to be trickier but if it is safe to do so, I will do it”.Under the Government’s Covid-19 roadmap, theatres, cinemas, nightclubs and casinos can reopen from July 20th but only if social distancing measures can be implemented.Mr Varadkar and Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan on Tuesday announced a €25 million package of supports to artists and arts organisations and resources for museums and culture workers as they prepare for the unwinding of coronavirus restrictions. The funding is in addition to money previously allocated to the sector.They said a total of €20 million was being allocated to the Arts Council, bringing its total for the year to €100 million. A further €5 million was being made available for securing the future of cultural and museum spaces and the production of digital art and online performances.“Over the last few months we have had many days of sorrow and suffering. In times like this we see the true value of culture to society - the books, the films, the songs, the plays - all the different forms of culture that entertain as well as enlighten,” Mr Varadkar said.“The pandemic hasn’t been easy for our artists and cultural institutions, and I know their livelihoods have been hit hard. So many events have been cancelled, so many places have been forced to close. “The Government wants to recognise how important culture is to our lives and it wants to match its words with actions.”Ms Madigan said that the arts sector had “suffered more than most in the crisis and will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after other sectors have returned to work”.“Despite this, I am confident that artists and arts organisations across the country can weather this storm and emerge with all the wonderful creativity that is its hallmark.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"City ranks little better than mid-table mediocrity in council survey on nightlifeActing Irish Fiscal Advisory Council chair says \u0026lsquosizeable stimulus\u0026rsquo needed to help recoveryResearchers claim results suggest dexamethasone should immediately become standard careScheme estimated to cost \u0026pound46m ended up costing close to \u0026pound100m by April last yearSocial distancing still required as masks can degrade through persistent coughingNational Heritage Week will take place from August 15th to 23rdTaoiseach Leo Varadkar says cinemas likely to be reopen in August as meaures easeJohn Larkin QC not to take up position on the bench until tenure as AG concludesIrish Water says drought risk persists in many areas despite recent heavy rainfall\u0026lsquoGreen new deal\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquowell-being indices\u0026rsquo are promised among other measures\u0026Eacuteamon \u0026Oacute Cu\u0026iacutev casts doubt on viability of three party deal as Green candidate warns it will be a \u0026lsquohard sell\u0026rsquoOne third of population wearing face-coverings as protection against spreading Covid-19James Joyce liked his food and drink but had little time for \u0026lsquovegetable philosophy\u0026rsquoReport confirms the church sought to have data protection legislation amended but failedCongress attracts UK competitors with entries far exceeding numbers in normal on-site eventOireachtas Covid-19 committee to hear Government could face \u0026euro30bn deficit this yearCrucially, Catherine Martin, the Green Party deputy leader, has supported the dealUnion says pledge on commission on future of broadcast and print media \u0026lsquolong overdue\u0026rsquoTaoiseach Leo Varadkar enjoys record ratings with Fine Gael surging since the electionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4280556.1592313633!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin natives cast a cold eye on capital s nocturnal charms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCost is cited by many respondents as the main barrier to enjoying a night out in Dublin. File photograph: GettyNormally dear old Dublin is a magnet for millions of overseas visitors keen to explore the city and experience the craic they believe available on every street corner, but Dubliners appear considerably less enamoured by their capital’s charms.The results of a just-published survey on city nightlife from Dublin City Council suggest that, at best, Dublin is a mid-table mediocrity. Moreover it is far, far adrift of the more alluring European hotspots, Berlin, London and Amsterdam.According to the council’s latest Your Dublin Your Voice survey, 73 per cent of Dubliners have a negative view of their city’s nightlife and rate it as either “somewhat or very poor”.In what might be viewed as kicking a city when it’s down, just 13 per cent of the 1,184 people who took part in the survey, ranked Dublin in their top three European cities for nightlife. This leaves it mid-table between Madrid and Prague, although to be fair to those casting the harsh judgment the survey was conducted pre Covid-19,By comparison, Berlin scored 56 per cent, London finished comfortably in the top three with 40 per cent of respondents ranking it highly while Amsterdam was awarded either a gold, silver or bronze medal by 38 per cent of respondents.Almost inevitably money was on the minds of many with cost said to be the main barrier to enjoying a night out in Dublin. All told 41 per cent of people said it was too expensive while infrequent transport options also emerged as an issue.Dubliners were asked about their engagement in multiple activities at different time slots between 6pm and 6am. And it emerged that the early evening was the only time when there was widespread activity.What happens after midnight?The majority indicated that they shop, eat out, go to cafes and exercise between 6pm and 9pm, but after the watershed activity narrows to the pubs while after midnight it becomes confined mainly to dance clubsWith the exception of music-related options there appears to be little demand for other activities after midnight.The survey indicated considerable support for a night-time manager, someone to co-ordinate nightlife and culture in Dublin, with 70 per cent saying they were “somewhat or strongly” in favour of such a role.“While priorities following Covid-19 will have changed, the reopening of the city offers an opportunity to innovate and improve on what was available in the evening or at night in Dublin,” said council economist Juliet Passmore. “Previous engagement patterns, highlighted in the survey, suggest that there was strong demand for activities up to 9 pm.”Thinking about getting away?

Photograph: Caroline QuinnDamien EagersLeon FarrellPA Wire Voters have little enthusiasm for the proposed new coalition - but Green voters say the party should enter government to take action on climate change, according to the results of the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.The first such poll since the general election also shows how Fine Gael’s fortunes have been revived by the pandemic crisis, with the Government and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar enjoying record approval ratings and support for Fine Gael surging since the election.Given a choice between the proposed coalition, a different coalition or a general election, the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-Green government was the favoured option with the support of 36 per cent of voters. However, 27 per cent favoured a different (unspecified) combination while a third of voters (33 per cent) said they would prefer another general election.Among Green voters, however, support for the proposed three-party coalition was considerably higher, at 48 per cent.When voters were asked what the Green Party should do, 48 per cent said they should “make the best deal it can and form a government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil”, while a further 18 per cent said the party should form a coalition if its demands on climate action were met and 28 per cent of voters said the party should never form a government with the bigger parties.However, when Green voters were asked what the party should do, they were strongly in favour of entering government, with 31 per cent saying they should do the best deal they could, and a further 61 per cent saying they should enter government if their demands on climate action were met.Green leader Eamon Ryan needs a two thirds (67 per cent) majority among his members if the party is to join the coalition. The final draft of the programme for government was agreed by the three party leaders on Monday and will go to members for ratification.On party support, the numbers show strong growth in support for Fine Gael since the general election and a surge in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s personal approval rating to 75 per cent. The satisfaction rating for the government is 72 per cent, though governments and leaders everywhere are seeing an increase in their ratings during the pandemic.In each case the comparison is with the final Ipsos MRBI poll of the general election campaign, though the results are not entirely comparable and today’s poll was conducted by telephone, owning to coronavirus restrictions. Previous polls have been conducted through face-to-face interviews.The poll was conducted among over 1,200 respondents between June 11th and 14th.

Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:   Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesBoris Johnson has executed a humiliating U-turn over free school meals for the poorest families in Britain over the summer, announcing a new £120 million voucher scheme after pressure from footballer Marcus Rashford. Just hours before Labour was due to force a vote on the issue in the House of Commons, risking a rebellion from Conservative backbenchers, the prime minister’s official spokesman announced a new £120 million “Covid summer food fund”.“Owing to the corona pandemic, the PM fully understands that children and parents face an entirely unprecedented situation over the summer,” he said.The U-turn came after ministers repeatedly rejected the idea of extending the scheme over the summer, as they did over the Easter break.Asked if Rashford’s pleas had helped to change the prime minister’s mind, his spokesman said: “The prime minister welcomes Marcus Rashford’s contribution to the debate around poverty, and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a sportsman to highlight important issues.”He said families entitled to free school meals would receive a one-off voucher at the end of the school term, worth £15 a week for the six-week school break, which they can spend in supermarkets.Rashford had stepped up his campaign to pressure the UK government into feeding hungry children during the school holidays.He responded to Tuesday’s news with a tweet: “I don’t even know what to say. Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.”Labour was seeking to maximise the government’s embarrassment and force a U-turn, by using an opposition day debate in the House of Commons to hold a vote on extending the voucher scheme.Several Conservative backbenchers, including former minister George Freeman, and the chair of the education select committee Robert Halfon, had urged the government to change course.On Tuesday morning, the Manchester United player began tweeting about the UK’s poorest families, who cannot afford to pay their water and electricity bills or put food on the table.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Halfon commended the government for helping vulnerable families by raising the living wage, cutting taxes for lower earners and extending the freeze on fuel duty.But he said carrying on with the free school meals programme “would be the right thing to do” as the latest figures show “2.5 million children are not learning” while away from school and food insecurity has “nearly doubled”.Halfon added: “There are lots of food programmes across different government departments. If they just consolidated those programmes, they would almost have the money for the free school meals programme over the summer, which would cost roughly GBP110m.”One cabinet minister was criticised after weighing into the debate to correct one of Rashford’s tweets, in which he said: “When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown.”Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, replied: “Water cannot be disconnected though.”Rashford replied, noting: “I’m concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a difference #maketheuturn.”The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, wrote: “Imagine having priorities so warped that this snarky comment is your response to Marcus Rashford’s powerful campaign.”Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow education secretary, used an interview on BBC Breakfast to argue that the issue “is about humanity”.She said: “There will be many Conservative MPs today watching this and having read Marcus’ letter who will be agonising about whether they support the government or not in this because they will want what’s best for children.”She added: “So, I’m asking all politicians, whatever party they’re in, this is not about party politics, this is about making sure children don’t go hungry over the summer holidays.”Rashford has received the full backing of Sir Keir Starmer and Labour.The Co-op is one of the big businesses to support Rashford. The firm has pledged to extend its free school meals scheme throughout the summer holidays at its 25 academy schools and said that 6,000 students who normally receive government-funded free school meals would receive Co-op gift cards. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"disastrous lockdown can never repeated even virus returns","story":"Three months after we entered lockdown, as we tiptoe out to non-essential stores and meet a lonely relative, we can begin to benefit from something previously unavailable – experience. Instead of having to rely entirely on widely varying mathematical models and fight an unknown virus in a fog of uncertainty, governments can start to see what has actually worked in different places around the world.This new situation can have immediate benefits. For instance, we can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level. We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it. Great swathes of our hospitality industry could thus be saved.We also know that these and other European countries are continuing to make progress without quarantining people entering from low-risk countries nearby, and can therefore concentrate on testing arrivals and stopping people coming from high-risk places. So the rather belated decision to require everyone arriving in the UK to quarantine themselves for two weeks ought soon to be ditched.We can also begin to discern the true cost of a national lockdown, not just in economic but in human terms. The unemployment figures about to be released represent a personal catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people. Large rounds of corporate redundancies mean worse is to come. For many iniduals, lockdown is going to mean depression, family breakdown and despair.On top of this, we can now be sure that there will be tens of thousands of undetected cancers. Evidence is mounting that domestic abuse is rising, and mental health deteriorating. Dental standards will have dropped sharply, with lasting consequences. Above all, the education and development of millions of young people has been severely damaged, and they will carry the scars of that for the rest of their long lives.We now know therefore that a lockdown is not a temporary blip or a paid holiday, but a disaster for our society. It is increasing inequality, social tension, and unaffordable debt. Globally, the World Bank has estimated that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty. Such a disaster cannot under any circumstances be repeated. There can be no second lockdown.To use yet another wartime analogy, a lockdown is like Dunkirk – a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure. I am not singling out the Government for that, for this has been a failure at multiple levels: a failure by the whole world to prevent the trading of wild animals for consumption by China to report the initial outbreak openly by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic.Out of such failure, we have also learned crucial lessons. One of these is that some countries have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown, even though they are large, complex and open nations. Germany and South Korea are examples that stand out.Furthermore, we can see that these countries have something in common – from the outset they were much more ambitious about testing. South Koreans used a fully-prepared track and trace system at once, and Germans were tested for the virus on a vastly greater scale than the people of Italy, Spain, Britain or America. This is why the Government, correctly, is rolling out a track and trace system here.Yet there is a danger of thinking that that is all we have to do. We should observe that even the South Koreans have sometimes struggled to keep a lid on the virus. And this week’s renewed outbreak in Beijing shows it can easily return just when you think you’ve got rid of it. If it is true that a lockdown represents a massive failure of policy and the costs of it cannot be repeated, and also true that testing has always provided the key to avoiding such failure, then it is time for the British Government to be much more ambitious in its goals.In particular, ministers should listen carefully to Tony Blair. That is not an easy sentence for me to write, given that I spent four years of my life as his official arch-enemy. But the report published earlier this month by his Institute for Global Change argues persuasively for the Government to prepare now for testing on a truly massive scale – involving millions of tests every week as people enter the country, arrive at work, attend conferences or just decide to go out.His argument is that a wide range of rapid tests are now under development and that they can be rolled out faster with Government funding, commitment and accelerated permissions. Many are being developed by British firms. While the cost would run into billions of pounds, it would be very little compared to the costs of one day of lockdown and could even be financed through special bonds.These almost instant point-of-use tests would provide warning of any outbreak and could be used to produce the data necessary to act quickly and avoid further lockdowns. They would be used in conjunction with lab-based tests to pinpoint new cases. This is not an alternative to a track and trace system, but could make that far more likely to be successful.Such a programme would require the harnessing of the resources of many small labs, expanding large ones, and making financial commitments to firms who could manufacture the simpler, mass tests. Taking them would become part of our way of life. But that is better than mass unemployment and widespread other illnesses becoming our way of life instead. Currently, the Government appears to be encouraging employers to adopt such testing but has not made the leap to saying this is an overriding national strategy.It ought to do so, with a Cabinet minister responsible for seeing it through. We have seen enough to know that a lockdown is so destructive that it can only ever be allowed once. That is why we should get out of it as soon as that can safely be done. But it is also why we should prepare, invest and organise to avoid it ever being contemplated again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford students could get bumped up grades exam performance","story":"Oxford University has told students that they can apply for “mitigating circumstances” if their performance in exams was affected by George Floyd’s death.Prof Louise Richardson, Oxford’s vice-Chancellor, said that the university is “determined to support our black students in every way possible”.In a letter to students, which was also signed by 35 of Oxford’s College principals, she explained that she shares their concerns about the “traumatic effect of the brutality which killed George Floyd, adding that it was a manifestation of institutionalised racism”.Prof Richardson’s letter followed a student campaign which called for university leaders to recognise that black students have been left feeling “traumatised” by watching videos of Mr Floyd’s last moments. In particular, they called for Oxford’s black students to be granted mitigating circumstances in their exams.Prof Richardson\u0027s letter in response to the “brutal killing” of Mr Floyd said that students “feel their performance has been affected” should submit a circumstances form after their final examination or assessment.Several other universities also told The  that if their students felt their performance had been adversely affected by Mr Floyd’s death, they could apply for extenuating circumstances.  Usually reserved for those who have suffered from acute illness or from bereavement, Oxford says that it deals with applications for mitigating circumstances on a “case by case” basis.The university said that examples of actions examiners could take if they uphold the application, include bumping a borderline candidate up to the higher grade or disregarding a paper if the student’s performance was “clearly out of line” with their other papers.Prof Richardson also said that tutors will be alerted of any potential need to reduce workload for students affected by the death of Mr Floyd. “We urge any undergraduate who is feeling the strain to contact their tutors… as soon as possible,” she said.The university was seeking to hire more black councillors as soon as possible, which the student campaign had also called for. An Oxford University spokesman said that they have always had a policy of taking mitigating circumstances into account for “any student who believes that a problem has seriously affected their academic performance”.They said that the vice-Chancellor’s letter to students was intended to “remind them that the process exists”.The vice-Chancellor’s letter comes amid renewed calls for Cecil Rhodes’ statue to be removed from Oxford’s Oriel College over his links with Britain’s colonial past.On Friday night members of the college’s junior common room voted in favour of removing the Rhodes statue from the College\u0027s facade, arguing that it should instead be moved to a museum and properly contextualised. Students resolved to explicitly demand the College takes down the statue.University College London, Newcastle, Cardiff, Sheffield and Warwick universities, all of which are members of the elite Russell Group, confirmed that their students would be allowed to apply for leniency in their grades. We appreciate and understand the impact and deep emotions this has evoked amongst our students,” a Cardiff University spokesperson said. “We recognise that these events may have had an impact on students’ ability to perform to their academic potential.”Warwick University has said that black and minority ethnic students “can and should” submit apply through the university’s mitigating circumstances process if they have “experienced racial trauma due to the current events surrounding the murder of George Floyd and following news and social media content”.Loughborough University said that recent events in America were likely to affect its students, and invited them to submit an additional mitigating circumstances claim “to explain how they have been impacted by recent global events”.The University of Arts London is also allowing extenuating circumstances claims in relation to George Floyd’s death, in addition to “concerns about structural racism and the subsequent protests in support of Black Lives Matter”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir arthur bomber harris statue latest target activists","story":"Sir Arthur Bomber Harris has become the latest target of activists demanding statues are toppled, over his wartime aerial bombardment English Heritage is liaising with the politan Police about the safety of the statue after anti-racism protestors targeted other public monuments in recent demonstrations.The Second World War officer, who pursued the Allied bombing of Nazi Germany, has a memorial outside the dedicated RAF church of St Clement Danes in London, which campaigners want to be reviewed and removed.A senior RAF source told the : There is no situation where vandalising a monument of someone who fought for and delivered our freedom, could ever be justified.Scores of statues across the country honouring figures with links to the slave trade and colonialism have been earmarked for removal by campaigners in the wake George Floyd’s death in the US.The British RAF commander, who helped devise the bombing of Dresden, has now been listed alongside slave traders by activists seeking to “Topple the Racists”, with pacifist groups calling for an end to his glorification. Monuments to Edward Colston and Robert Milligan have already been purged from public spaces, and campaigners are calling for Harris’s likeness to be removed for being a “colonial warmonger”.Erection of the statue in 1992 was originally opposed by the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), and current members have welcomed the reassessment of Harris’ controversial legacy.The commander is often blamed for the fire-bombing of Dresden which killed around 25,000 people, which some have branded a war crime, and a general area bombing which earned him the nickname “butcher”.“I don’t think that Bomber Harris should be celebrated,” said Symon Hill of the PPU.“I think with the current debate around statues in the UK, it’s an opportunity for us as a society to think about our history, to think about what we want to celebrate.“If there is a reassessment of the Bomber Harris statue, we would certainly welcome that.”He added: “This is not about erasing history, we’ve spoken more as a society about British history since these protests than we ever did before.  It’s about learning from history, and choosing what we want to celebrate.”A listing on the Topple the Racists website reads: Sir Arthur Travers Harris, 1. Baronet GCB OBE AFC, was a colonial warmonger in Rhodesia and responsible for the area bombardment of civilian villages in Mesopotamia in the early 1920s.English Heritage owns the statue outside St Clement Danes Church, and is discussing probation measures after monuments in London and across the country were damaged in recent protests.A spokesman for the charity said: “We take very seriously any threat to the London statues in our care.

Hospitality chiefs have already warned that a failure to provide imminent clarity on the rule will result in tens of thousands of job losses and a devastating economic impact.  readers have had their say on whether the current rule should be changed. See what you fellow readers have had to say and then share your own opinion in the comments section below. All anyone needs to know is that the further you are apart, the less time you spend with people and the fewer people you see the lesser the risk. However this should be guidance to those at risk and everyone else should carry on as normal. We now know the NHS has capacity which was the initial concern.There is some evidence that two metres is safer than one metre, but the risks need to be balanced against the benefits. This is impossible.I have a lot of sympathy with the government trying to navigate the difficult choices.  If the government continues to be undermined like this by the media I fear for the outcome.Spain has just entered phase three. This means the two metre rule remains, but restaurants are open with 50 per cent outside and 30 per cent inside occupation allowed. But strangely you can have tables of 20 people with no social distancing, we are all baffled by this.Boris, pay attention, if this is OK for Spain, surely it is OK for the UK? It will go a long way to help the hospitality industry, so please think about it. The only people at serious risk from this illness are the elderly and those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes. There was a case for lockdown to protect the facilities of the NHS – that has now passed. There is no case for preventing the general population from going about their daily lives in order to stop the elderly and infirm dying. They must make their own choice whether to isolate and disintegrate or live normally. The government is misguided, if well meaning.Why not just say an arm\u0027s length? Everyone can do that, everyone knows that and it is similar to our comfortable space from a stranger anyway. Again and again this comes back to the complete and total failure to get a comprehensive test and trace system up and running. Even now, we are told it will be September before the current effort actually works.Without that, the government is entirely dependent on behavioural measures to try and slow the spread of the virus and prevent a second spike putting us back to where we were in early April.As well as the loss of jobs, it is the fact is that pubs, restaurants and cafes are part of our social fabric. Yes, I know I can open a bottle of beer or enjoy a tea and sticky bun at home but without the ability to socialise our mental health and relationships with others will suffer even further.The problem with the two-metre rule is that it\u0027s a bad compromise.When simulating the effect of liquid droplet distribution due to a cough or sneeze, it\u0027s amply clear that the range is far greater than two metres. The range of droplets when the cause is wearing a mask is very difficult to measure as it crucially depends on the mask type.On the other hand the economy is in ICU and needs to be given all the reasonable help we can give, open restaurants, even pubs and coffee shops, let the young and the brave enjoy themselves knowing the risk is there.The two-metre rule is arbitrary and although it does lower risk of contagion, it doesn\u0027t eliminate it, let the worried wear masks in public – that will lower their risk probably more than the two-metre rule.Scrap this destructive two-metre rule now. Reduce it to one metre and if infections continue to fall over the next month or so, scrap the social distancing rule altogether.If the recommendation is two metres, for many people that\u0027ll be one metre in practice.  If the rule is one metre then it\u0027s hardly worth having a rule at all.  Good old common sense tells you that the further apart you are will reduce any risk of infection from another person. However, it also tells you that it’s implausible that 60 million people can maintain a separation of two metres in daily life for very much longer. Even the normally rule abiding ones.I find that people insist rather than complain about the two-metre rule. I suspect that whatever the government says, the two-metre rule will stay by choice!More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel latest air travellers face ban flouting mask rules","story":"Spain is considering imposing a quarantine on visitors from the UK - but an agreed air bridge would scrap thatKey dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?Which are the likely candidates for an \u0027air bridge\u0027 holiday this summer?When can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet? Listen to our brand new travel podcastAir bridges enabling holidaymakers to travel overseas without entering self-isolation when they return will be announced by the end of June, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated.The Government is actively working on introducing travel corridors, he told LBC Radio, amid widespread concerns the quarantine policy is crippling the travel and tourism industry.We won\u0027t be in a position to announce which countries - where reciprocal arrangements go in place - until the 29th, he said.

Read our state-by-state guide to find out how the country is easing out of lockdown.Lift passes for one of Australia’s most popular ski resorts have sold out in a record-breaking time as resorts in the southern hemisphere prepare to open for their winter ski season.Thredbo in New South Wales will open on June 22, however the rush to secure lift passes has meant many who had already booked accommodation in the resort have been left disappointed and won’t be able to access the slopes.In order to reopen and comply with new Covid-19 safety regulations Thredbo has had to bring in new restrictions, which include capping capacity at 50 per cent and requiring all lift passes to be bought online in advance, rather than from an onsite ticket office.Over 35,000 people waited in an online queue to secure passes for June, July and August, which sold out within hours as the resort’s website struggled to cope with demand last week. Resort bosses are said to be overwhelmed by the demand to go skiing and snowboarding while the coronavirus pandemic continues.Many European resorts are watching their southern hemisphere cousins this summer, taking notes as they develop blueprints for how ski resorts may operate and ski holidays in the popular destinations like the Alps might recommence later this year.... including the introduction of a \u0027death deposit\u0027. Yes really. All visitors will from today be expected to pay a heavy coronavirus deposit of USD 3,000£2,370 upon arrival.The eye-popping service charge is being implemented to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 transmission in Cambodia, the Asian country said, and will cover laboratory testing, medical treatment, and accommodation. Also included in the fee is a US$1,500£1,184 for cremation should you die of the disease.Lee Cobaj has the details.Design and innovation firm Teague says its AirShield can clip over the dials of the air conditioning units above seats to “adapt aircraft cabin airflow to prevent the spread of viruses”. It claims to keep coughs and sneezes within the confines of a single passenger before removing them via the plane’s air filtration system. Teague says the AirShield can control air flow between passengersThe Seattle-based company says the AirShield can be 3D-printed, retrofitted to existing aircraft and will help restore consumer confidence in air travel as airlines begin to resume flights for the first time since the pandemic lockdown. How would these actually work? Hugh Morris has the story.Peru’s most famous sight, Machu Picchu, will be slicing the number of people who can visit when it reopens from its imposed closure in July, reports Emma Cooke.Prior to the pandemic, the Inca citadel, a Unesco World Heritage Site, saw average visitor numbers of 2,000 to 3,000 a day. This number could climb up to 5,000 during peak times. Now, only 675 visitors will be allowed in each day to ensure social distancing is maintained.The new rules were announced by Jean Paul Benavente, governor of the Cusco region. Alongside the restrictions on visitor numbers, he added that guides will only lead tour groups of seven or fewer, while visitors will be required to wear masks at all times.Peru has been under strict lockdown since March 16, but has still seen the second highest number of cases in Latin America - 225,000 - and around 6,500 deaths.

She writes:The reality of post-pandemic life finally caught up with me. Outside of my Brighton bubble the eerie quiet of usually busy public places coupled with ubiquitous Covid-related notices and constant safety announcements felt unnervingly dystopian.

There will also be options to add extensions to offer onward trips into Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Portugal.Provence by car?Tom Barber, Co-Founder of Original Travel, says: Given that – at least in the short-term – long-haul travel looks unlikely, and airports will be difficult places to navigate, we predict that for the first time in a generation European road trips from the UK are going to be the hottest ticket in town this summer. Elsewhere, Iceland\u0027s new driving route offers a good chance for scenic isolation, according to  Travel\u0027s Emma Thomson, who writes: The new Arctic Coast Way is the perfect antidote to Iceland’s overcrowded south. The five-star hotel in Bath has announced it will swing open its doors again on July 10, with new social distancing measures in place.According to our hotel experts, this luxurious hotel encompasses two townhouses in Bath\u0027s showpiece Georgian crescent –the best possible location in town. The biggest draw is the elegant spa - which will be operating. The inviting main communal area includes a 12m indoor relaxation pool, a vitality pool with massage jets, plus a sauna and steam room.On the dining front, The Royal Crescent is best known for its very indulgent afternoon teas with sweet and savoury choices. The hotel will also be offering all NHS staff 2-4-1 afternoon teas for the first four weeks after they re-open.Read our expert review here.There’s a flutter of confidence in a surge of holidaymakers looking to take to the waves around Britain, as current restrictions on travel abroad continue to hold stubborn, reports Ben Parker.Scotland and its islands, in particular, have been earmarked by cruise insiders as somewhere to watch, with one operator telling The  that despite such trips being domestic travel they “will be very attractive for those wishing for a real escape”.The Isle of SkyeAnticipation was raised further when Scotland’s Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Tourism, Fergus Ewing, set July 15 as a provisional reopening date for some businesses across the country as long as there are “appropriate safety guidelines in place”.The managing director of Saga Cruises, Nigel Blanks, said he expects “a spike in interest for round-Britain cruises” and that once they have the go-ahead from authorities they would be able to resume “within three to four weeks”.Discover more on the story here.New Zealand reported its first new cases of coronavirus in almost a month today when two recent arrivals from Britain tested positive after being released early from quarantine to visit a dying relative.New Zealand, whose prime minister Jacinda Ardern has been praised for her aggressive strategy of \u0027eliminating\u0027 the virus, had zero active cases before the two women, one in her 30s and one in her 40s, arrived on June 7, reports Giovanni Torre.Arrivals need to have spent at least one week in isolation and test negative for Covid-19.

The outbreak has been traced to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food centre in the southwest of Beijing where thousands of tonnes of produce change hands each day.In addition, Shanghai required certain travellers from Beijing to be quarantined for two weeks. This marks China\u0027s most significant spike since February, stoking fears of a second wave of the respiratory disease which emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year and has now infected more than 8 million people worldwide.Testing under way in Beijing yesterday following a spike in new casesSpain is considering imposing a quarantine on visitors from the UK when it opens its borders next week in reciprocity to a similar measure imposed here, Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on the BBC.We will be checking what the UK will be doing and we will be in a dialogue with the UK to see whether or not we should be introducing reciprocity as they have different measures than the rest of the European Union, Gonzalez Laya said in an interview.As it stands, Spain will open its borders to members of the EU’s Schengen Zone on June 21.

But the women were released under new compassionate leave rules that came into effect on June 9. The rules have now been suspended.The women came on a flight from the UK via Doha and Brisbane and were permitted to leave managed isolation in Auckland on June 13 on compassionate grounds, and drove to Wellington.One of the women had mild symptoms on arrival in Auckland, but they were wrongly attributed to a pre-existing condition so the pair were placed in managed isolation rather than strict quarantine.New Zealand’s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told a media conference the virus may have been detected if the daily health checks in managed isolation had been done properly, including asking them about every inidual Covid-19 symptom.“My understanding is the person who had the symptoms was asked, \u0027are you okay?\u0027,” he said. “The protocol is to go through each inidual symptom. It may well have been that that would have elicited specific symptoms that may have led to suspicion.”Dr Bloomfield said the women\u0027s application for leave was expedited because of the sudden death of their parent, Bloomfield said, and they were allowed to travel to Wellington without being tested.Dr Bloomfield said the women drove themselves and had been in contact with one family member in Wellington, who had also been staying at home. He said the women could have picked up the coronavirus in the UK, in airports, or on their flights.New Zealand public health workers are now testing and isolating all others who may be at risk of exposure. Staff at the Novotel Ellerslie in Auckland, where the women stayed, will be stood down from duties and tested. Footage of the women at Auckland Airport is also being analysed to identify people at risk. Health staff have been in contact with their Australian counterparts to trace passengers on the same flights as the women.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday she had not declared the country virus-free because New Zealand will have cases again in the future.Of course, our hope and expectation is that should be at the border... if they\u0027ve quarantined, of course, that\u0027s a very different story than in the community.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/16/09/michael-clifford.jpg","title":"5 seconds of summer michael clifford homophobic tweets apology","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.A number of sexist and homophobic tweets made by Michael Clifford resurfaced after he expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement5 Seconds of Summer guitarist and singer Michael Clifford has apologised after past homophobic and sexist tweets resurfaced online.In one post from 2013, Clifford reportedly told bandmate Luke Hemmings that he tweeted “like a f*g” and used the word “gay” in a derogatory way.In another post, he said: “I am so bad at making sandwiches, I would be a terrible woman.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesScreenshots of the tweets began circulating after Clifford expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement on Instagram.Ant Middeton apologises for comparing Black Lives Matter to EDLKJ Apa responds to criticism over Black Lives Matter ‘silence’Hollywood star Ron Perlman offers to fight Ted Cruz for charity“I am so f**king sorry for all the dumb s**t I did when I was younger,” Clifford wrote in his apology.“I am a different person now with a much better understanding of the world.“Some people have access to a digital megaphone a bit earlier than they should, unfortunately, I was one of them.”In a follow up tweet, he added: “I am so sorry for hurting anyone.

Nasa has made a map of its trajectory, showing where the annular phase of the eclipse will be visible, weather permitting. Millions more will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse, though unfortunately for sky gazers in the UK and US it will not be visible.Details of object that smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse revealed“It’s much more important to watch the weather forecasts a day or two before the eclipse and choose a location with the best chance of a cloud-free sky during the eclipse.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing – better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A live stream of the eclipse will be broadcast by Timeanddate, allowing anyone to watch it no matter where they are in the world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But the new report attempts to highlight the broader impact on the economy that its digital store has, by giving an account of how many sales are facilitated through those apps more broadly.The new announcement comes amid questions over the scale of app stores run by Apple, Google and other companies. Last week, Axios reported that US antitrust investigators asked Apple whether chief executive Tim Cook would give testimony as part of a probe into competition among tech companies.Apple and Mr Cook have repeatedly said that they welcome the scrutiny of the App Store that has come with increased questions over whether it offers a fair playing field to the apps and companies that rely on it to reach customers.Apple Stores to re-open across UK after coronavirus shutdownSome companies have argued that they are unfairly treated on the App Store, where any payments made are subject to a 30 per cent cut from Apple. That has led some of the biggest firms to opt out of offering in-app purchases entirely, with Netflix and Amazon\u0027s apps directing their customers to their websites if they want to subscribe or purchase, for instance.Apple\u0027s new research showed that such purchases – those made outside of the App Store system, but which were facilitated by apps downloaded from within it – made up the vast majority of the sales that are facilitated by the App Store.More than 85 per cent of the $519 billion total facilitated by the App Store goes entirely to third-party developers and businesses, it said.It pointed to examples such as companies that sell physical goods and services,which together represent the largest share of the total at $413 billion.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Other kinds of commerce apps made up the rest of those physical goods and services, such as transport apps, ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, and food delivery apps like Just Eat.Away from those physical apps, other digital services such as music and video streaming services which in total represented $61 billion. It is in that area that many companies have opted out of payments through the App Store entirely, with major Apple competitors such as Spotify and Netflix instead choosing to make their customers sign up outside of their apps and then use that log-in on their Apple devices.Those companies have argued that Apple\u0027s own services – which include TV and music streaming services that are direct competitors – are able to gain an unfair advantage because they can be favoured by Apple and do not have to lose any cut taken in purchases through the App Store.Apple also offers the only way of getting new apps onto its iPhones and other hardware, since there is no way to download or install software from other platforms. Apps that sell other apps are banned.Away from physical goods and services and digital subscriptions, advertising made up most of the rest of the total, with marketing being shown on games as well as free apps such as Twitter and Pinterest, alongside those that show apps but also offer subscriptions, like the MLB\u0027s app.China represented almost half of that $519 billion figure, Apple said, with $246 billion of the total. That is in part because of the country\u0027s more developed mobile commerce ecosystem, Apple said, with a variety of services available through a host of apps that operate outside of Apple\u0027s payment systems.The US made up $138 billion, Europe represented $51 billion, Japan accounted for $37 billion and the remaining $47 billion came from the rest of the world.The study was commissioned by Apple but carried out by independent economic consulting firm the Analysis Group.The report only looked at data from 2019, meaning that it did not reflect the changes that have come about as the result of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdowns.Since then, the company has seen a rise in apps like social, education and business chat tools, as well as food and grocery apps. At the same time, apps that have faced restrictions or require in-person interactions have dropped off, Apple said.Apple\u0027s announcement came just days before its Worldwide Developers Conference, which it uses to highlight the work of those who make apps for its platforms. This year, that will take place entirely online, and the virtual event is rumoured to bring major changes to Apple\u0027s products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many found their job offers were withdrawn once the impact of Covid-19 became clearer.The cut-off date was later extended by three weeks. However, many iniduals who had started work before the new date were still ineligible for support because their employer had not submitted the required paperwork to add them to the payroll. The MPs urged ministers to ensure all new starters are eligible.People who have become self-employed in the past financial year and those whose average annual profits are more than £50,000 cannot claim grants under the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS).The committee wants the Treasury to extend support to both of these groups as well as freelancers who are paid through PAYE contracts, and directors of limited companies who take a large part of their income in idends.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailShort-term PAYE contracts are commonplace in industries such as television and theatre but people paid in this way cannot be furloughed and are ineligible for the SEISS as they are not technically self-employed.“This cannot be right,” the committee said. MPs recommend that the government should give this group 80 per cent of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.Providing support for directors of limited companies is trickier, the Treasury has consistently said. People in some industries who are in effect sole traders decide instead to set up as a limited company for a number of reasons, one of which is that the tax rate on idends is lower than on income.The Treasury argues that its support schemes are designed to replace income, not idends which come out of company profits. But groups supporting the self-employed and small businesses counter that this is unfair on people who have chosen to set up in this way.Workers must not be abandoned as furlough winds down, warns union boss“There are over 710,000 freelancers who work through limited companies, most of whom are now burning through their savings to get by,” said Andy Chamberlain, policy director of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed.“This group in particular is a startling and glaring omission from the government support. There are also hundreds of thousands of people who became self-employed just last year, who, in the early stages of their freelance career, are likely to be in a particularly precarious financial position. The government has left these groups completely out in the cold.”He pointed out that over a million fewer people than expected claimed the SEISS grant and urged the government to reallocate unused funds to help struggling freelancers.According to campaign group ForgottenPAYE, many more people are ineligible for support than the Treasury Committee’s report estimates. ForgottenPAYE is calling for grants of £14,000 for new starters and the newly self-employed to cover living costs between March and September.“Hardworking taxpayers have already gone homeless, been pushed into debt and poverty, and been forced to turn to food banks in a bid to survive,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group.“The mental health impact on those who have had their pleas for help ignored for over 13 weeks has resulted in a drastic increase in depression and anxiety, with many verging on suicide.“This is a huge step in the fight for justice for the 1.7 millions freelancers and 3 million-plus taxpayers who have been left with zero income and zero financial support from the government for over 13 weeks during an economic crisis.”   A Treasury spokesperson said: “The swift and targeted action we’ve taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.“Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

John Lewis reopening two branches in Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames, while Argos opened 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark took a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores, and enjoying crowds at several of them, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. One shopper at Birmingham’s Primark store said it had been “a delight” to return to the city centre shop, which like other stores saw large queues that morning.She told the PA news agency: “It took a long time but I bought a lot of dresses, nightwear and bras. I have missed it a lot and I’m really happy.”Other shoppers were less pleased with the extended queues. Kristina Taylor, 40, who works in finance, told PA: “I just need to have my screen protector replaced, that’s all. It’s just something that has been niggling me since day one.”Asked if she was pleased about shops reopening, she said: “Yes and no.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“I will pop by Primark to see the queue. But not keen on all of this queueing, it makes me think twice about whether I need something from that shop.”Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops remained closed while bookshops took items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.Councils urged shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces on streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Paul Scully, minister for small businesses, told BBC Breakfast: “The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way.” He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people “should shop and shop with confidence”.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisers Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam said charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims jumped 23.3 per cent between April and May to 2.8 million, the latest official figures show. The claimant count has now soared 125.9 per cent, or 1.6 million, since March when the UK entered lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.Average real wages fell for the first time in more than two years and job vacancies plunged 60 per cent in just two months, Office for National Statistics data revealed on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe number of people temporarily out of work, including furloughed workers, rose by six million at the end of March into April, leading to a large fall in total hours worked.The total number of weekly hours worked in the three months dropped by 94.2 million (8.9 per cent) in the three months to April – the sharpest annual fall on record.‘Millions of jobs at risk’ as UK economy shrinks by a fifthThe disastrous employment figures come days after official data showed the UK economy shrunk by a fifth in the first month of lockdown.According to early estimates, the number of paid employees dropped by 2.1 per cent or 612,000 in May compared with March as employers laid off staff and stopped hiring.Average pay growth slowed “notably” in April 2020, the ONS said, and the three months to April saw total pay fall 0.4 per cent, the first inflation-adjusted annual fall since January 2018.Month-to-month, average pay fell by 0.8 per cent between April and May, following a fall of 2.8 per cent between March and April.Vacancies also disappeared at a record pace. Experimental single-month estimates indicated the number of vacancies fell 60 per cent, from 818,000 to 476,000 between March and May 2020 as employers stopped hiring.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe official headline unemployment rate between February and April remains low at 3.9 per cent, up 0.1 per cent on last year.However, the figures lag behind the real situation in the economy which is likely to be significantly worse. The number of people in employment fell by 430,000 between March and April, and more timely HMRC data suggest that the number of employees continued to fall by 160,000 in May.This rise has not yet shown up in the unemployment figures because many of those recently out of work have not actively sought new employment due to the lockdown, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.The Foundation said the latest data ”reinforces the likelihood that Britain is on course for the biggest jobs crisis for at least a quarter of the century”.Economists forecast that unemployment could hit 11 per cent by the end of the year as emergency government support schemes close.The Claimant Count, which includes universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims, jumped more from 1.6 million to 2.8 million between March and May. The ONS cautioned that it is not possible to say what proportion of these claimants are unemployed and which are in employment but are low-paid and so entitled to claim benefits.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: “The headline figures may not show it, but a lot has changed since April – with the Claimant Count rising to 2.8 million, the unemployment rate is likely to be much higher than 3.9 per cent now.“But with the lockdown being eased and the economy opening up, hiring should grow. The scale of the growth in unemployment through the rest of the year will depend on consumer confidence and how employers react to the winding down of the furlough scheme.”A big concern for businesses and the government is what happens when the job retention scheme (JRS), which is currently paying the wages of 9 million furloughed workers, winds down.The furlough scheme closed to new applicants last week and from 1 July, employers will have to contribute to workers’ wages as the scheme is tapered down by the end of October.“The true impact of the crisis on the labour market is likely to only be revealed once the JRS starts unwinding in the second half of the year,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. “Many businesses are expected to bring only part of their furloughed workers back, while they seek to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time.“This means we could see the rate of unemployment average 11 per cent next year – and the last time it reached these levels was during the recession in the 1980s.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), called on the government to introduce a job guarantee to protect millions who may soon be out of work.“The labour market is on red alert,” Ms O’Grady said.“We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage. The government must work closely with unions and business at national and industry level to get the next steps right. “The plan for recovery has to prioritise protecting and creating jobs. Getting people back into work is the only way out of recession. That’s why we need a job guarantee scheme to help those who lose work, especially young workers.” TUC analysis suggests that young people face a particularly pronounced spike in unemployment. Some 890,000 people aged under 25 work in either accommodation and food or arts, entertainment and recreation.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is a lot going on in the labour market at the moment. In the two months to May, we saw a 600,000 fall in the number of people on the payroll. So, we are starting to see a worsening, worsening labour market.”Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “Today’s figures are starting to show the impact of Covid-19 on our economy, but our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts have protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs, setting us up for recovery.“Already our nationwide network of work coaches have moved in to support jobseekers across sectors and match them with employers who are recruiting.

Many found their job offers were withdrawn once the impact of Covid-19 became clearer.The cut-off date was later extended by three weeks. However, many iniduals who had started work before the new date were still ineligible for support because their employer had not submitted the required paperwork to add them to the payroll. The MPs urged ministers to ensure all new starters are eligible.People who have become self-employed in the past financial year and those whose average annual profits are more than £50,000 cannot claim grants under the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS).The committee wants the Treasury to extend support to both of these groups as well as freelancers who are paid through PAYE contracts, and directors of limited companies who take a large part of their income in idends.

MPs recommend that the government should give this group 80 per cent of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.Providing support for directors of limited companies is trickier, the Treasury has consistently said. People in some industries who are in effect sole traders decide instead to set up as a limited company for a number of reasons, one of which is that the tax rate on idends is lower than on income.The Treasury argues that its support schemes are designed to replace income, not idends which come out of company profits. But groups supporting the self-employed and small businesses counter that this is unfair on people who have chosen to set up in this way.Workers must not be abandoned as furlough winds down, warns union boss“There are over 710,000 freelancers who work through limited companies, most of whom are now burning through their savings to get by,” said Andy Chamberlain, policy director of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed.“This group in particular is a startling and glaring omission from the government support. There are also hundreds of thousands of people who became self-employed just last year, who, in the early stages of their freelance career, are likely to be in a particularly precarious financial position. The government has left these groups completely out in the cold.”He pointed out that over a million fewer people than expected claimed the SEISS grant and urged the government to reallocate unused funds to help struggling freelancers.According to campaign group ForgottenPAYE, many more people are ineligible for support than the Treasury Committee’s report estimates. ForgottenPAYE is calling for grants of £14,000 for new starters and the newly self-employed to cover living costs between March and September.“Hardworking taxpayers have already gone homeless, been pushed into debt and poverty, and been forced to turn to food banks in a bid to survive,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group.“The mental health impact on those who have had their pleas for help ignored for over 13 weeks has resulted in a drastic increase in depression and anxiety, with many verging on suicide.“This is a huge step in the fight for justice for the 1.7 millions freelancers and 3 million-plus taxpayers who have been left with zero income and zero financial support from the government for over 13 weeks during an economic crisis.”   A Treasury spokesperson said: “The swift and targeted action we’ve taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.“Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it adds new features that have come to Garmin\u0027s cheaper bike computers, including improved mapping and routing tools and better ways of understanding the effects of workouts.The new computer sits at the very top of the line-up, selling for up to £599.99. It goes alongside the more recently refreshed Edge 530 and 830, which are smaller and lower priced.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt the same time, Garmin also said that it will update the Edge 130, its cheapest cycling computer, to the Edge 130 Plus.Garmin tends to use its Plus branding for updates that represent a more evolutionary update to products rather than a whole overhaul. Both of the new computers feature largely similar designs to their predecessors, with small feature updates rather than dramatic changes, and come at comparable prices.The Edge 130 is more recently updated, having first been released in 2018. But it has still been left without some of the features that might be expected to trickle down from the more expensive end of the line-up.The new, Plus version of the 130 includes better GPS tracking as well as an altimeter so that it can understand how much elevation it has covered. It can also better track health metrics such as heart rate tracking and other tools, as well as having a smartphone connection to allow for syncing of routes, notifications and the weather.Garmin launches new bike lights that can see if someone is behind youThe Edge 1030 Plus update brings new mapping features that let users navigate using courses from either Garmin\u0027s own apps or third-party tools like Strava or Komoot. It also has improved health metrics – such as tracking recovery time and training load – as well as a new feature that will recommend workouts to cyclists based on their recent activity.The process of setting the computer up will also be simpler, Garmin suggested. In the past, beginning with a new Edge unit meant starting from scratch with its settings and connections to external sensors, but they will now be imported over from other, older units.It also includes tools to connect to smart trainers to take advantage of the recent boom in cycling indoors. Those features will come to the Edge 130 Plus in the future, Garmin said.Many of those features have been available in the Edge 530 and 830, despite their lower price. Both of those cycling computers were updated last year, and stay in the middle of the line-up.Some of the features – including the improved setup process – will come to the 530 and 830 as well as the non-Plus 1030 later this year, Garmin has said.Garmin will sell both the new products in bundles that will also include the new Varia cycling radars, which can alert riders when a car is coming up behind them, it said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2019, Instagram was criticised when it was thought to be limiting users\u0027 posts to only a small percentage of their followers.Facebook has recently been criticised about how it manages its algorithm too, after it reportedly shuttered research that would make the platform less isive but would also be “antigrowth” and require “a moral stance”.Systemic bias in technological algorithms is not unique to social media platforms either. IBM said it would not continue to develop general purpose facial recognition because of the ways in which it harms communities of colour.Similarly, Amazon put a moratorium of one year on its own Rekognition facial recognition technology, following the protests in the US over the death of George Floyd.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re ecstatic and truly proud. This is a great success for Skylark Nano, and the Skyrora team in general.” said Robin Hague, Head of Launch.“Launching from Shetland is very important for us because it’s a potential option for our Skyrora XL orbital commercial launch vehicle. To understand the local launch conditions learning more about the wind profiles in Shetland is critical.”Skyrora XL is a three-stage rocket which the company hopes will carry satellites into sun-synchronous orbit.This trip would be over a range of 500km, and a 1000km altitude.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Those who refuse to wear masks may be turned away from services or handed fines of up to £100, the Department for Transport has said.Mr Khan, who has previously called for the policy to be extended to all areas where social distancing is not possible, said face coverings will be a “reality” for the foreseeable future.“This is part of the new normal,” he told LBC. “The reality is that for the foreseeable future – I predict for the next year or so – wearing face coverings is going to become the norm rather than the exception.”“I was pleased when the prime minister accepted the need for us to wear face coverings on public transport, and make it mandatory.”More than 3,000 additional staff including police officers have been deployed to public transport hubs across the country in an attempt to ensure people comply with the new rules.Hundreds of thousands of free face coverings will be handed out at train stations in the coming days as people continue filtering back to work and hitting the high street following the relaxation of lockdown measures on Monday.The government changed its advice on face coverings to help limit transmission of the novel disease earlier this month following calls for doctors, unions and MPs.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailCoronavirus: Should you be wearing a face mask?The World Health Organistion also updated its guidance on face masks on 5 June after insisting for months there was no evidence to suggest they are effective in public settings.It came after a review of evidence by researchers in Canada published in the Lancet Journal revealed that wearing a face covering may reduce the risk of spreading the virus to another person by around 14 per cent.All staff, outpatients and visitors in England’s hospitals will also have to wear face coverings. However, it is not compulsory for patients to wear face masks in primary care settings.Announcing the move, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “As the NHS reopens right across the country, it is critically important to stop the spread amongst staff, patients and visitors too.“So... we are setting out that all hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings.”“It will apply at all times, not just when they are doing their life-saving work on the frontline.  It will apply in all areas except those areas designated as Covid-secure workplaces.”The Department for Health has since said its guidance for people visiting GPs has not changed, saying patients were covered by general advice to wear face coverings in setting where social distancing is not possible.This has left GP surgeries and NHS providers “confused and unprepared”, the British Medical Association (BMA) has warned.“It is imperative that we do all we can to prevent the spread of infection in healthcare settings, so that patients and visitors can attend hospital and GP practices without fear of contamination,” said BMA chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul.“The wearing of masks by staff and face coverings by the public will be key to enabling this. It is clear though that the government has failed to properly plan for these changes which are now in effect and have left providers of NHS services confused and unprepared for how this will be implemented on the frontline.“Furthermore, it is still unclear as to whether mandatory face coverings will extend to patients attending GP practices.”Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The UK is preparing to lose rights to share security and business data with the EU after Brexit is completed at the end of the year, a minister has admitted.The flow of vital information will be cut off unless Brussels grants an “adequacy decision” – a process thrown into jeopardy by past legal judgements against Britain, critics fear.The security minister, James Brokenshire, refused to reveal “what stage of the process” has been reached, with just six months until departure day in December.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, he admitted to a parliamentary inquiry: “We will take sensible steps to prepare for a situation where that decision may not be in place.”Alternative measures “might need to be pursued”, Mr Brokenshire said – prompting a demand to reveal the details of how the UK would be “protected”.EU will not accept \u0027pig in a poke\u0027 Brexit deal from Boris JohnsonHe insisted the government remained “positive” that agreement would be reached, saying: “It is self-evidently in the interests of both side that the adequacy decision is in place by the end of the year.”But Dawn Primarolo, a

John Lewis reopening two branches in Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames, while Argos opened 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark took a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores, and enjoying crowds at several of them, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. One shopper at Birmingham’s Primark store said it had been “a delight” to return to the city centre shop, which like other stores saw large queues that morning.She told the PA news agency: “It took a long time but I bought a lot of dresses, nightwear and bras. I have missed it a lot and I’m really happy.”Other shoppers were less pleased with the extended queues. Kristina Taylor, 40, who works in finance, told PA: “I just need to have my screen protector replaced, that’s all. It’s just something that has been niggling me since day one.”Asked if she was pleased about shops reopening, she said: “Yes and no.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But not keen on all of this queueing, it makes me think twice about whether I need something from that shop.”Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops remained closed while bookshops took items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.Councils urged shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces on streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Paul Scully, minister for small businesses, told BBC Breakfast: “The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way.” He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people “should shop and shop with confidence”.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisers Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam said charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims jumped 23.3 per cent between April and May to 2.8 million, the latest official figures show. The claimant count has now soared 125.9 per cent, or 1.6 million, since March when the UK entered lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.Average real wages fell for the first time in more than two years and job vacancies plunged 60 per cent in just two months, Office for National Statistics data revealed on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe number of people temporarily out of work, including furloughed workers, rose by six million at the end of March into April, leading to a large fall in total hours worked.The total number of weekly hours worked in the three months dropped by 94.2 million (8.9 per cent) in the three months to April – the sharpest annual fall on record.‘Millions of jobs at risk’ as UK economy shrinks by a fifthThe disastrous employment figures come days after official data showed the UK economy shrunk by a fifth in the first month of lockdown.According to early estimates, the number of paid employees dropped by 2.1 per cent or 612,000 in May compared with March as employers laid off staff and stopped hiring.Average pay growth slowed “notably” in April 2020, the ONS said, and the three months to April saw total pay fall 0.4 per cent, the first inflation-adjusted annual fall since January 2018.Month-to-month, average pay fell by 0.8 per cent between April and May, following a fall of 2.8 per cent between March and April.Vacancies also disappeared at a record pace. Experimental single-month estimates indicated the number of vacancies fell 60 per cent, from 818,000 to 476,000 between March and May 2020 as employers stopped hiring.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe official headline unemployment rate between February and April remains low at 3.9 per cent, up 0.1 per cent on last year.However, the figures lag behind the real situation in the economy which is likely to be significantly worse. The number of people in employment fell by 430,000 between March and April, and more timely HMRC data suggest that the number of employees continued to fall by 160,000 in May.This rise has not yet shown up in the unemployment figures because many of those recently out of work have not actively sought new employment due to the lockdown, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.The Foundation said the latest data ”reinforces the likelihood that Britain is on course for the biggest jobs crisis for at least a quarter of the century”.Economists forecast that unemployment could hit 11 per cent by the end of the year as emergency government support schemes close.The Claimant Count, which includes universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance claims, jumped more from 1.6 million to 2.8 million between March and May. The ONS cautioned that it is not possible to say what proportion of these claimants are unemployed and which are in employment but are low-paid and so entitled to claim benefits.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: “The headline figures may not show it, but a lot has changed since April – with the Claimant Count rising to 2.8 million, the unemployment rate is likely to be much higher than 3.9 per cent now.“But with the lockdown being eased and the economy opening up, hiring should grow. The scale of the growth in unemployment through the rest of the year will depend on consumer confidence and how employers react to the winding down of the furlough scheme.”A big concern for businesses and the government is what happens when the job retention scheme (JRS), which is currently paying the wages of 9 million furloughed workers, winds down.The furlough scheme closed to new applicants last week and from 1 July, employers will have to contribute to workers’ wages as the scheme is tapered down by the end of October.“The true impact of the crisis on the labour market is likely to only be revealed once the JRS starts unwinding in the second half of the year,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. “Many businesses are expected to bring only part of their furloughed workers back, while they seek to tentatively reopen after the lockdown. Hiring new workers is also likely to be put on hold for some time.“This means we could see the rate of unemployment average 11 per cent next year – and the last time it reached these levels was during the recession in the 1980s.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), called on the government to introduce a job guarantee to protect millions who may soon be out of work.“The labour market is on red alert,” Ms O’Grady said.“We need strong action now to stop lasting economic damage. The government must work closely with unions and business at national and industry level to get the next steps right. “The plan for recovery has to prioritise protecting and creating jobs. Getting people back into work is the only way out of recession. That’s why we need a job guarantee scheme to help those who lose work, especially young workers.” TUC analysis suggests that young people face a particularly pronounced spike in unemployment. Some 890,000 people aged under 25 work in either accommodation and food or arts, entertainment and recreation.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is a lot going on in the labour market at the moment. In the two months to May, we saw a 600,000 fall in the number of people on the payroll. So, we are starting to see a worsening, worsening labour market.”Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “Today’s figures are starting to show the impact of Covid-19 on our economy, but our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts have protected thousands of businesses and millions of jobs, setting us up for recovery.“Already our nationwide network of work coaches have moved in to support jobseekers across sectors and match them with employers who are recruiting. By responding to the needs of communities across the UK they will be at the heart of our revival and renewal, helping people find new roles and move forward with their lives.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But they had hit several dead ends in the hunt to find the truth behind what happened to Madeleine in .However, new findings have revealed that a German prisoner is a signicant suspect in the disappearance of the then toddler.He has now been unmasked as -year-old drter “Christian B”.He is a prolic burglar, who has previous convictions for sex crimes against young girls.We cannot reveal his full identity due to Germany privacy laws.The suspect was born in Germany in  but moved to Portugal in his late teens.The paedo has been described as being white with short blond hair and of slim build at around ft tall.The suspect - who was  at the time of Madeleines disappearance - has twice been convicted for sex crimes against young girls.German police claim to have concrete evidence that Maddie is dead, sending a letter to her parents.They believe he initially planned to rob the holiday apartment before he moved on to a sexual motive.The prime suspect was already known to British and Portuguese police in relation to Madeleines disappearance in Praia da Luz.Yet, the recent information came from a witness who stepped forward following the appeal by the Met Police on the tenth anniversary in .The suspect - who is  now - is believed to have been leading a transient lestyle at the time, as he travelled between Portugal and Germany.It is believed he was living in the Iberian nation between  and  working in the food industry.The man is known to have been in the area at the time of Madeleines disappearance, having taken a -minute phone call an hour before she went missing.Christian B has been linked with the disappearances of several children over the past  years, including that of a six-year-old boy in Portugal in  and a five-year-old girl in Germany in .Authorities in Belgium have also linked him to the murder of missing -year-old Carola Titze, who disappeared while on holiday in De Haan on July , .Her severely mutilated body was discovered among the sand dunes on July . Christian B has also been associated with the missing person’s case of Inga Gehricke.The child disappeared during a family outing in Saxony-Anhalt on May , .The father of missing six-year-old René Hasee, who disappeared on June ,  while on vacation with his family in Aljezur, Portugal - roughly km from Praia da Luz - has also claimed his sons case has been reopened by police. Christian B has also been linked with the disappearance of Jair Soares, a seven-year-old who vanished in August .Meanwhile, Peggy Knoblochs disappearance has also been linked back to the German paedo, after she went missing in May .And Christian B is now being investigated over the rape and murder of -year-old German boy Tristan Brübach.He is currently in a German prison, serving a sentence for drug offences.Christian B was convicted of raping of a -year-old American woman in Portugal in , but is understood to be appealing the charge.The suspect is believed to have a total of  convictions, including burglary - with German Federal Crime Agencydirector Christian Hoppe claiming he is known for stealing from hotels and holiday apartments.German police - who are treating the case as a murder inquiry - believe he initially planned to rob the holiday apartment before he moved on to a sexual motive.Scotland Yard also revealed that a s VW T Westphalia white campervan has been linked to the suspect, and was seen in Praia da Luz days before she vanished.He is also believed to have been living in it in the days and weeks before and after the disappearance.A  Jaguar XJR has also been connected to the German sex offender, with one of the two vehicles believed to have been used the kidnapping of Madeleine.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note.

I am clued up on the dference a U-turn decision would make on the . million vulnerable children across the UK who are registered for free school meals because  years ago I was one of them.”He wrote an impassioned letter to the PM and Boris Johnson urging them to make a change.Several Tory MPs have come out to urge the Government to think again.George Freeman said this morning: This is an unprecedented crisis. The PM @DowningStreet  Chancellor @RishiSunak have been right to take unprecedented steps to help shield the most vulnerable. Free School Meals are a leline for many v low income families. Let’s do the right thing: extend FSM thru summer.Tory MP Robert Halfon, the chair of the Education Select Committee added: “The problem with these kinds of programmes is its very bureaucratic.“People have to apply to the council, whereas the free school meal programme is very simple, families understand it and it goes to those who need it most.If we are really going to be the workers’ party, we have got to support those workers when they are in distress.Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, tweeted: I totally get that some LA funding has been put in place, but am baffled why WM colleagues picking this hill to die on.I didnt have or need free school meals, but I went to a school where a huge % did. Food security during the holidays so important. Its basic. Feed the kids.Labours Rebecca Long Bailey said today: “Any government that is willing to let the poorest children in the country go hungry needs to take a long hard look at its priorities.This morning Piers Morgan blasted Matt Hancock as a “fiasco”.The GMB host told the Health Secretary to “do your bit” and step up to help.The Department for Education has already refused to reverse the plans, insisting the national voucher scheme “will not run during the summer holidays”.The voucher scheme was extended over the Easter holidays and half term to give parents extra help with food costs.Instead of getting free school meals like they would at school, they would instead get £ a week vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.But the Government are currently standing firm in refusing to extend the scheme.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning: We are still putting more money in even though not through the free school meals programme.Boris Johnson has yet to respond to Mr Rashford, but his official spokesman has insisted he will “as soon as he can”.However, this morning Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey risked inflating the row with a spat on Twitter.Rashford tweeted: . When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown #maketheuturnBut Ms Coffey replied to another journalists tweet saying: Water cannot be disconnected though.Rashford in turn wrote back: I’m concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a dference #maketheuturn.Following their earlier exchange, Ms Coffey tweeted a further message to Mr Rashford, adding: Hi @MarcusRashford, I welcome your passion for supporting children and the most vulnerable in society - a passion we share.

We have kept schools open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. We will continue to support the economy and help all of us get through this.The Government will oppose Labours motion in the opposition day debate and will argue they have other targetted money instead.It is believed that the measure over the six holiday weeks would cost about £ million - less than the £million the Government has promised councils.Meanwhile, the government furlough scheme to help businesses is expected to cost up to £ billion.Youll likely qualyyou get any of the following:Before coronavirus hit, children in reception, year one and year two automatically got free school mealsthey attend a government-funded school.This applies whether their parents claim benefits or not.But while schools are shut due to COVID-, these children wont be covered unless their parents recieve benefits, as mentioned above.Under normal circumstances, schools are not expected to provide free school meals to children when theyre off sick Jason McCartney, another Tory MP, said: “It’s not about politics . . .

I rang them to ask why it hadnt grown, but I was told this was normal.It got to six months and there was a little bit of growth but not much and after a year it still hadnt grown. I was left with scars and bald patches.Luke from Bradford said he asked for a refund but claimed his complaint fell on deaf ears.He claims the clinic offered him another operation at half the price.They eventually offered Luke a £ refund, barely a third of what he paid for the botched job.Luke said he thought he had found a bargain deal, but has now urged other men to fully research procedures and clinics.He added: I had always been really self-conscious about my hair and I hated it being wet or getting blown in the wind.Id always spend extra time styling it before going out, trying to hide my bald spot.It was affecting my confidence and my self-esteem and it was something Id been wanting to do for a few years.A hair transplant is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body to a bald or balding part of the body.This is usually from the back or side of the head to the front of the head.They would typically occur under local anesthesia.Pattern baldness is responsible for the majority of hair loss cases and this is usually genetic.Other factors can also contribute including:I looked into it and a lot of the places offering the treatment in the UK charged around £,, but they were offering it for £,.”He said the clinic had great reviews on Trust Pilot, leading him to believe he was getting “good value for money”.What I didnt know then was that anyone can post a review and companies can ask for reviews to be taken down, so I feel like I wasnt getting a full picture.After the operation Luke posted a review on YouTube.He was then contacted by the Hair Dr clinic in West Yorkshire who offered to fix the botched surgery.On March  he went under the kne and has now said the treatment he got in the UK was “world’s apart” from what he received in Turkey.In Turkey, the surgeons didnt even speak English so I had to communicate through a translator.Theyve done a great job and Ive already noticed signs of growth in my hairline.Id just encourage anyone to properly research the clinic and operations first.Dr Arshad, the lead surgeon at the Hair Dr transplant clinic, who carried out the repair procedure on Luke said Luke’s case had “really struck a chord” with him when he saw his video on YouTube.“I see so many clients in this unfortunate position on an almost weekly basis.Many people can look abroad for cosmetic procedures as many clinics often offer a cheaper rate.One expert told The Sun that more often than not, many people are ing with complications.Dr Knut Moe, Medical Director at Sons said clinics abroad can seem attractive due to a bargain price.Patients can get drawn in by free consultations and sales pitches with offers of free flights, accommodation and knockdown rates for hair transplants. The reality though is that too often we are seeing menwith hair transplant surgery that has gone wrong or had complications. Anyone can put up a nice-looking website to sell transplants, but it takes skill and training to do hair transplants properly.He added that transplants change your scalp permanently and that they can leave scars and alter your appearance.It is much better to get no transplant at all rather than getting the wrong transplant at the wrong time.He saidyoure looking for a transplant then are some things you need to do first.Men thinking of getting a transplant should ask themselvesa transplant is the right option for them, will they look back in  or  years and say ‘ why didn’t someone stop me  -they do decide to get a transplant, they need to ask are the surgeons qualied, is the after care good enough, does the clinic have a good reputation - these transplants are permanent, remember.  Most people don’t need a transplantthey catch their hair loss early enough and could manage their hair loss with medication such as Finasteride and Minoxidil which are proven to be affordable, safe and effective .Before embarking on a hair transplant it is imperative that research is carried out on the clinic and the surgeon.Hair transplant is very safe surgery but is not free of potentially serious side effectsit is not conducted by a qualied surgeon in the correct way.”He urged people to check the surgeon has a credible track record in the field and to check that they are a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons ofEngland before embarking on such a sensitive procedure.That way we can try and limit the number of unfortunate stories like Lukes”, he added.The Clinic Center told The Sun that it treats , patients a year - most of which are from the UK.They said: We followed Lukes healing process after a month, three months and six months.

Our kids were excited about the day ahead. Jo was up in Batley for the day where she was the MP, ready for a day of surgeries and helping local people, the part of the job she loved most. A few hours later Jo had been killed and reeling with shock and pain I was working out how to tell the children. There is absolutely nothing worse.

Jo was an optimistic person, passionate and empathetic. As a family we often think about what she is missing out on, the things we would give anything for her to experience just for a moment. Sometimes I also think about what politics is missing with her not here. Because Jo was an optimist. She believed in people and in our country. She was always someone who sought to find out what was good in someone rather than just focus on their faults. And our country needs that now more than ever. The phrase “more in common” – from her maiden speech - has come to define Jo. That phrase was never to suggest we don’t have dferences or shouldn’t disagree with each other – of course we should. It’s about trying to recognise that these dferences and disagreements shouldn’t define or ide us. The corona crisis is of course something that Jo wouldn’t have imagined, certainly not its scale and severity. But she would have guessed that one of the few positives to have come out of it is a sense of community spirit.We all have our own stories of neighbours looking out for each other, doing the shopping for vulnerable people or going to work to keep the rest of us supplied and healthy. And that feeling is supported in the polling. The number of people who say we look after each other has gone from % in February to % in May. The question now is can we keep this sense of community spirit going or will it fade as events overtake us  The answer to that question isn’t yet written. And what we all decide to do or not do will determine the outcome. That’s partly a question about our leaders and politicians – will they seek to ide us or bring us together, will they spread fear or reassurance  But it’s mostly about us, and what we decide to do.

Either way,the PM needs a hand, here’s a brief glimpse into le as a black man in the UK. Warning – you may find some of this uncomfortable... To be black in this country is to be seen as a threat first and a person later. Being black is having to tell your children, as my father warned me, that they will need to work twice as hard and shout twice as loudly to be as valued as much as their white counterparts.  Being black is reminding your teenage kids that they will have to prove their commitment to learning so that they don’t fit into some teachers’ preconceived stereotypes. Being black is having to Google a country before you go there on holiday, just to check that it isn’t racist. Being black is being told, at least once in your le, “You don’t sound black” by a white person you meet in person after speaking over the phone. Being black is having to activate your kind, smiley nature to activelyset white people at ease on your initial meeting. Being black is wearing a suit to the airport because you are fed up of being stopped at customs in jeans and trainers. Being black is having to tell people not to touch your hair or head out of fascination. Being black is accepting that you will be stopped at least once by police - regardless of your profession – and asked: “Is this your car ”. Being black is that experience of taxis not stopping for you at night in central London – with the ones that do, asking for the fare up front. Being black is having to explain to people the history behind the ‘N’ word and why it’s use is unacceptable. Being black is having people tell you that they aren’t racist because they listen to Bob Marley.

Many couples have had to postpone their celebrations during the coronavirus pandemic and venues worry that they will struggle to keep afloat without the profitable summer season. Asked in the House of Commons about the timeline for nuptials to resume, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick replied: I know how important weddings are for venues and of course how many peopleaposs plans have now been disrupted. I can tell her that there is a signicant effort across Government to allow people to hold weddings, in particular small ones with appropriate social distancing, as soon as we can. But this must be done safely. He added that he is working with the Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland and faith leaders on the issue.  MPs also called for more clarity on the rules for places of worship being allowed to reopen. Tory former minister Tim Loughton said members of the clergy were confused by the guidelines. He said: One vicar said to me, so is it right that I can invite five members of my congregation to the church grounds for a barbecue and some beers butwe start saying prayers weaposll get busted  So I suggested to him he could advertise his services as a barbecue with a very long grace. We need much clearer guidancewe are to get our churches properly and fully back into use as soon as possible. They should never, frankly, have been put out of use in the first place. Mr Jenrick replied: The guidance was worked through by faith leaders in our task force, places of worship can open for funerals and Public Health England have previously published guidance on how to manage funerals safely. And as I said earlier, I very much hope we can set a date for weddings soon. Mr Jenrick later admitted the current rules which only allow places of worship to open for inidual prayer have limited applicability to members of the Muslim and Jewish communities. Shadow communities minister Janet Daby said: The Secretary of State has announced the opening of places for inidual prayer despite some faiths only practising communal prayer in their place of worship.

Ministers argued that the government does not normally pay for meals during school holidays but had already caved and covered the cost during the Easter break. Critics argued that the pandemic meant that ministers should make an exception to help families struggling to survive. The vouchers have been used since mid-March while schools were closed during the  coronavirus  lockdown. The £-a-week vouchers are available to use in local supermarkets by parents whose children who usually have received a free school lunch. Labour and other oppositions parties, charities and other campaigners had been calling for the government to continue the scheme through the long break. Footballer Marcus Rashford - who has raised more than £m during the crisis to feed hungry kids - turned up the heat with a heartfelt open letter to MPs. Pressure had mounted as the government refused to heed his demands. The government had instead promised a £m pot of money for councils. But the fund the PM offered wouldnapost guarantee a daily meal for every poor child. But now the government has U-turned and poured an extra £m, on top of the £m pot, into a one-off Covid summer food fund.How many children are eligible  Around . million children are eligible for the free meal vouchers, which are provided to most parents receiving  Universal Credit, income support, income-based employment and support allowance, income-based job seekers allowance or child tax credit. In England, about . million children  claimed for free school meals  in , or about % of state-educated pupils. In Manchester, where Marcus Rashford grew up, the figure is .% The take-up was greatest in parts of London, the north of England and the Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were receiving free school meals. How will the scheme work   The fund will essentially extend the current system of supermarket vouchers, which are given to parents of poor children who canapost attend school due to the virus, for six weeks over the summer break. Itaposs thought parents will be offered a one-off voucher to cover all six weeks of the summer holiday, worth £ per week per child. The vouchers will then come firmly to an end in September, when the government hopes all school pupils will be back in the classroom.  All those who currently qualy for free school meals due to their household income will qualy - the same criteria as for the current voucher system.

The -year-old Manchester United footballer renewed calls today for the government to continue its £-a-week free meal vouchers for children over the summer holidays. In a plea to MPs he tweeted: When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown. But Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey replied: Water cannot be disconnected though. The DWP chief refused to budge, instead offering a £m council fund, despite warnings of a surge in child hunger and unemployment this summer. New figures show the benefit claimant count has reached its highest since  - and .million jobs have now been paid for by the furlough scheme, which starts winding down in August.  The estimated cost of extending free school meal vouchers in England over summer, £m, could be paid  times from the £.bn spent on furlough so far. Scotland have Wales have already said they will continue free meal vouchers over the summer holidays - and in Wales itaposs worth £. per child per week.Ms Coffeyaposs blunt reply caused outrage on Twitter where it was branded detached and heartless. Former BBC journalist Ben Smith said it was dismissive, flippant, arrogant, detached from reality - all the worst things about modern politics and politicians. Twitter user @rowetta said the disgusting tweet should make Ms Coffey ashamed and sacked while fellow user Jake Humphrey wrote: This is a really bad look. Really bad. Marcus Rashford then stepped in - telling her: I’m concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a dference #maketheuturn. Two hours later, after the backlash, Ms Coffey posted follow-up tweets addressed at the footballer. She wrote: I welcome your passion for supporting children and the most vulnerable in society - a passion we share. We are working to the same aim. I  this Govt will continue to actively help and support families and businesses through this emergency and beyond. We supported people renting and ensure they cannot be evicted  intervened with electricity suppliers on bills. We have kept schools open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. We will continue to support the economy and help all of us get through this. Ms Coffey is right that the law stops water firms disconnecting the supply to peopleaposs homes. But the law doesnapost stop gas or electricity firms disconnecting their supplies, used for heating. That means while water canapost be switched off entirely, hot water can. Twitter user @creature_dan wrote: Hi, Therese. Often, when people donapost have hot water, they say aposthe wateraposs offapos. Youaposve met some people, right  The row erupted as pressure mounts on the government to make a U-turn and extend free meal vouchers over the summer holidays in England. Worth £ a week, free school meal vouchers help poor families with the extra cost of feeding kids stuck at home during Covid-.  They were extended over the Easter holidays after public pressure - but so far the government has refused pleas to keep them over summer too. Instead, the government has promised a £million fund for councils to help families who are struggling to buy food and other basic essentials. Downing Street said it expects schools to use the money to make food parcels available for collection or delivery. But critics say thataposs not good enough - and Labour says extending the vouchers would cost £m, almost double but a drop in the ocean compared to other coronavirus projects.  Some Tory MPs are expected to pressure their own government to make a U-turn when Labour leads a debate in Parliament tonight. Labour leader and Arsenal fan Keir Starmer tweeted today: Never thought I’d find myself on the same team as Spurs and Manchester United players but proud to stand with @MarcusRashford and @GaryLineker on the #HolidaysWithoutHunger campaign. So far the government is refusing to accept Labouraposs demands. Ministers plan to delete Labouraposs motion calling for free school meal vouchers, and replace it with one backing what the government has already done. Defiant Ms Coffey wrote today: Iaposm proud of other Govt support for families and businesses incl keeping people safe in their homes, business grants  supporting the poorest in society. We will get through this together. Compared to Labouraposs recession and record deficits just over a decade ago, this government has strongly supported families and businesses during this emergency, thanks to a decade of fixing the economy. We still have challenging times ahead and we will get through this together. The latest row erupted this morning after Marcus Rashford - who wrote MPs a powerful letter yesterday about his own upbringing by a single mum - renewed his pleas in a string of tweets.  He wrote: . When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown . When you turn on your kettle to make a cup of tea or coffee think of those parents who have had to default on electricity bill payments just to make ends meet having lost their jobs during the pandemic. . And when you head to the fridge to grab the milk, stop and recognise that parents of at least , children across the country this morning are waking up to empty shelving . Recognise children around the country are this morning innocently questioning ‘why ’  out of  children in any given classroom are today asking ‘why ’ ‘Why does our future not matter ’ He later wrote: We are trending no  and  in England.I need everyone’s help to keep this noise going as I head to training but before I go, to ALL MPs in Parliament, this is not about politics. The same way us players put rivalry aside when we put the England shirt on, please #maketheuturn. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claimed today it was great so many people were interested in the issue - but refused to budge.

How heartbreaking that many tens of thousands of kids face hungry weeks because Boris Johnson ignores the England football star’s plea to continue a voucher scheme for low-income families during the holidays. Rashford deserves praise for never forgetting his poor background and championing kids like him. Privileged Johnson deserves condemnation for his lack of support for those born with none of the advantages he enjoyed. The Manchester United player is teaching the out-of-touch Tory a morality lesson. Free school meals vouchers are a leline for struggling families.

Here, she explains how...A couple of weeks after lockdown started, I found myself on the other side of London in a housing estate I didn’t know, trying to find a young woman I had never met before. She was a refugee, pregnant, alone and living in temporary accommodation. It was pouring with rain and I was standing in a stairwell as, in broken English, she was trying to explain over the phone how I could find her. When I finally got to her doorstep, I couldn’t even smile at her because I was wearing a face mask. And social distancing rules meant I couldn’t go in to sit down, have a cup of tea and explain the things in the box I was bringing her, as I would do normally. But as she stood in her doorway, I could tell she was really excited.  Hours later, we received a text message. It said how happy and delighted she was with the things we had brought her – that now she finally felt ready to have her baby, which she hadn’t before. It was such a moving moment.We normally have a core group of  volunteers, but since coronavirus it has just been me and my daughter Rosa, , running everything. So we decided to concentrate on baby boxes for newborns. They contain a sling, a steriliser and a breast pump as well as baby clothes, nappies, wet wipes, nappy cream and hygiene stuff for the mother. We’ve even started putting in a couple of loo rolls. It has been a struggle, but we have been helped enormously by National Lottery funding. And because lockdown has made it dficult to accept donations, where necessary we have also been able to afford a few bits to put in the boxes. The grant from The National Lottery has been a leline for us, allowing us to keep giving out our boxes which, in turn, the mothers say are their leline. Meanwhile, in Kent, another National Lottery-funded project, Youth Sports Trust, is tackling a problem facing young people - fitness and staying connected with friends... Sport is keeping kids connected  Teacher Guy Wilkins works closely with children’s charity Youth Sport Trust to enable children and young people to access competitive sport, training opportunities and learning leadership skills - and lockdown hasnapost put a stop to that. The -year-old, from Kentaposs Marjorie McClure School, said: During lockdown we’ve been running online meetings, setting physical challenges and sharing ideas for PE at home - such as ‘washing line tennis’ - to bring people even closer together. Many of us also got involved with the charity . challenge. For example, one of our students, James,  – who is a massive Crystal Palace fan – did  keepy-uppies.” Jamesaposs mum Wendy said the charity has been a vital link to the outside world for her son - and he has loved embracing the challenges. She told us: James has really benefited from having regular Zoom calls from school with his form tutor and Guy, as well as Tom who runs the after school cricket club which James attends.  James loves to have a look at these ideas and try out as many as he can. They suggested that the pupils try the daily Joe Wicks sessions as a fitness challenge and heaposs ended up doing them most days. The school challenged the pupils to take part in the . challenge so James ran walked .km and made a donation to the Bromley Mencap charity. Guy’s school – which is one of a network of six YST inclusive schools across South London – receives up to £, of National Lottery funding each year. This money helps to pay for leadership opportunities, give young people training to increase self esteem, confidence and communication skills, and the opportunity to experience badminton, volleyball, wheelchair basketball and athletics at inclusive sports festivals.They will also be taking part in YST’s National School Sport Week at Home, taking place from  to  June. You can find out more about it here.Back in London, The Science Museum has come up with its own idea for getting people involved - by putting many of its amazing artacts online... Science Museum fans flock online  Natasha McEnroe is the Science Museumaposs Keeper of Medicine. She explained: “The first year of opening for the Science Museumaposs new aposMedicine: The Wellcome Galleriesapos hasn’t at all been what I envisaged. “We were only open for five months before we had to close, and it was especially sad because we’d been lucky enough to have glowing press and visitor feedback.“Since lockdown we’ve been focusing on really pushing our digital delivery - which you can explore here . We are working on our oral history programme and - as part of a larger digitisation project, we’re photographing more than , objects from our collections – from space suits to Tracy the transgenic sheep. There’s also a very extensive  blog  and  learning resources and going online makes everything accessible to a much wider audience. “Some of our most searched items have been pieces including historic hospital ventilators.” The newly-opened Medicine Galleries - which were part funded by an £million grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund - have proved a huge hit since moving online.

Luke Horsfield, , from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was worried about his thinning hairline so found a clinic in Turkey that would perform a transplant for half the price it would be in the UK. Yet after flying over there for the six-hour operation, the -year-old was left scars and bald patches and no sign of any hair regrowth months after. Luke claims surgeons at the clinic couldnapost speak English and took too many follicular units from the back of his head during the op which left him scarred. The procedure, known as follicular unit extraction, sees hair follicles removed from the side and back of a patientaposs scalp and injected into the front where the balding occurs. He claims this lead to further thinning of his hair, scarring and bald patches and he eventually needed it repaired by another clinic. The clinicaposs website claims to give effective results for men experiencing thinning hair and promises the hairline will regrow. Luke, an IT technician, is now issuing a warning to others contemplating the procedure to properly do their research before undergoing treatment. He said: I did everything they told me to do as aftercare once I had the operation. But after four months, I saw literally no growth. I rang them to ask why it hadnapost grown, but I was told this was normal. It got six months and there was a little bit of growth but not much and after a year it still hadnapost grown. I was left with scars and bald patches.  Luke, who had the op in December , said his complaints fell on deaf ears and when he asked for a refund, they even offered him another operation for half the price. They eventually offered Luke a £ refund, barely a third of what he paid for the botch job. Luke, who began noticing his hairline was thinning at , said he thought he had found a bargain deal, but has now urged other men to fully research procedures and clinics. He added: I had always been really self-conscious about my hair and I hated it being wet or getting blown in the wind.  Iaposd always spend extra time styling it before going out, trying to hide my bald spot. It was affecting my confidence and my self-esteem and it was something Iaposd been wanting to do a few years. I looked into it and a lot of the places offering the treatment in the UK charged around £,, but they were offering it for £,. They had great reviews on sites like Trust Pilot, so I thought I was getting good value for money. What I didnapost know then was that you anyone can post a review and companies can ask for reviews to be taken down, so I feel like I wasnapost getting a full picture. Luke posted a review of his operation and treatment on YouTube and was contacted by the Hair Dr clinic in the UK offering to repair the botch job for free. Luke went under the kne again at the Hair Draposs clinic in Dewsbury, West Yorks., on March , and was left delighted with the results. He added: The treatment I got at the Hair Dr was worldaposs apart. In Turkey, the surgeons didnapost even speak English so I had to communicate through a translator.  Theyaposve done a great job and Iaposve already noticed signs of growth in my hairline. Iaposd just encourage anyone to properly research the clinic and operations first. Dr Arshad, the lead surgeon at the Hair Dr transplant clinic, who carried out the repair procedure on Luke, said: When I was shown Lukeaposs YouTube video and account of what happened with his previous hair transplant in Turkey it really struck a cord with me as I see so many clients in this unfortunate position on an almost weekly basis. Before embarking on a hair transplant it is imperative that research is carried out on the clinic and the surgeon.

The papier mache figure, which depicts the top half of a man emerging from a wheelie bin, seems to be someoneaposs answer to what should replace the controversial slave trader. In one hand the man is holding a small globe, and in the other a mobile phone, with a text that reads aposEngland for the Englishapos. And on the bin words are stencilled which read: Spoiler alert: St George was Turkish. It is is believed to be a nod to last Saturdayaposs events when a group of around  people gathered to aposdefendapos the Cenotaph in the south west city, Bristol Live reports. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   The aposstatueapos has been chained to a lamppost in a spot facing the empty plinth of the statue of Edward Colston.The statue was pulled down on Sunday, June , and pushed into the docks after a Black Lives Matter protest, and has sparked a nationwide debate around how Britain should acknowledge its imperial past and links to the slave trade. On Saturday, a group of around  people, mainly football fans and bikers, gathered in the city under an aposAll Lives Matterapos banner, and this artwork appears to reference that. A passer-by, who did not want to be named, said: Itaposs really striking, and quite poignant after the events of the weekend. There were lots of people stopping and looking and taking photos. Itaposs clearly a response to the people who came out to guard the Cenotaph against nothing on the weekend, the artist doesnapost seem to hold them in very high regard, she added. Itaposs got a bit of a loutish look to it, with the man in his string vest looking at a phone that says aposEngland for the Englishapos. Itaposs quite clever. Theyaposre obviously telling anyone with that kind of belief to get in the bin. The assertion on that wheelie bin that St George was Turkish is factually incorrect. While most historians agree the early th century Christian martyr St George was born and grew up in Cappadocia, which is in what today is modern Turkey, George himself was a Cappadocian Greek, and not Turkish.

Emma Fegan, , rang the school where she was due to pick up one of her children before she left home to tell them that she would be late. But seven or eight minutes later, she was involved in a single vehicle accident which no-one witnessed. A farm worker, travelling with a colleague in a Land Rover in heavy rain, saw something which looked like debris on Hoveringham Road in Nottingham and they stopped.His workmate then saw what looked like a car in the River Trent, NottinghamshireLive reports.I could see a car on its roof upside down, the statement read. He called emergency services on his phone at .pm and the non-swimmer added I was hoping that someone who was inside the car was caught in an air bubble or something like that. The inquest heard about the rescue operation and how a person was found in the car and freed and taken to the Queenaposs Medical Centre for resuscitation and rewarming was attempted but was sadly unsuccessful. The virtual inquest heard the medical cause of death was immersion in water as a result of a single vehicle road traffic accident. Resident Joanne Connors did not go back down that road because it was quite severe when I went down it initially.She told assistant coroner Jonathan Straw: Itaposs not a busy road but, you know, itaposs quite seasonalthe weather is good everybody drove there. The weather was atrocious that day.Double decker school bus driver Tomasz Branski said thereaposs always a problem there when asked by the coroner about an area at an entrance to a farm where photos showed standing water. He said: When itaposs raining, sometimes the water is as deep as up to knee-level. He was travelling towards Caythorpe with children on board and had just approached a right hand bend when a black BMW came around the bend in the opposite direction. The coroner asked him: The BMW that came past you in the opposite direction, relative to the weather conditions, how would you say it was being driven  Mr Branski said it was definitely too fast, adding that he had to move towards the edge of the road, so I would not be hit by the vehicle. A family liaison officer, speaking on behalf of her husband, Richard, said at the point where the bus driver saw Emma the road was a mph speed limit. The BMW was a rear wheel drive and prone to being slippy on ice and in water. He had experience himself of aquaplaning in the car at mph. There was no forensic evidence to derive the precise speed at the point the BMW hit the standing water and lost control.

Her doctor discussed a total hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiation, and the mum, whose son was three-years-old at the time, was told she would never be able to have another child once her treatment began. She decided to create embryos but knew she wouldnapost be able to afford a surrogate, leaving her hopes dashed until her mum Sheila stepped in.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. Micaela thought she had a yeast infection until her doctor told her they had found something on her cervix and ordered a biopsy. Two weeks later she was told she had small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer.Micaela, from the US state of Illinois, told the Sun when her mum urged her to visit a fertility doctor, she broke down in tears and replied: But mum, evenwe do create embryos, we can’t afford a surrogate. It’s impossible. Thataposs when Sheila volunteered, telling her daughter: If I’m allowed to do it, I will. Sheila was  when she gave birth to Micaela, who said they are more like sisters than mother and daughter. During the fertility treatment  embryos were created, and Micaela then went through a hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer. She was told she was cancer free three months after her last round of treatment, meaning she could now focus on trying for a baby.  Sheila was  at the time, leaving Micaela worried that the doctors wouldnapost allow her to be her surrogate. But they did, and within months the implantation took place. Mum-of-three Sheila, now , said: I laughed as the embryos were implanted. This is the first time I’ve gotten pregnant without a man in the room. Her two other children are currently aged  and .  Afterwards, mum and daughter cried and embraced, and  days later Sheilaaposs pregnancy test came back positive.  It wasnapost an easy time for Micaela, however, as her mum and her babies were an hour away, she didnapost get to experience milestones such as feeling them move for the first time, and she worried that there would be no bond between them. Deep down, she said, she wished she was carrying the twins - a boy and a girl - herself.

One passer-by reported seeing the animals as they drove along the scenic Dunlicky Road towards Kilkee. There was a lot of thunderstorm activity in the area at the time and the sky blackened all of a sudden. The rain was pouring down really heavy for about  minutes, they told the Irish Examiner. The torrential storms also forced a number of people who had been fishing nearby to run for cover in their cars.One local said: Just after we passed Dunlicky Castle we saw the cows in the field. There were a few cars and men in there as well. I think it was nine milking cows we counted. It is not the first time that cows have been struck by lightning in recent years in Ireland.

Pyongyang boasted that it destroyed the inter-Korea liaison office with a terric explosion in retaliation for human scum defectors, who now live in the South, sending anti-Kim Jong-un leaflets into the North. Surveillance video released by Seoulaposs Ministry of Defence showed a large explosion that appeared to bring down the four-storey structure.The blast was captured on a thermal observation camera from a South Korean observation post in Paju. The explosion also appeared to cause a partial collapse of a neighbouring -storey high-rise that had served as a residential facility for South Korean officials who staffed the liaison office.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.       The office, just inside the border in the North Korean town of Kaesong, was set up in  to foster better ties between the neighbours, who technically are still at war. The explosion was heard at just before .pm local time on Tuesday and it was followed by a plume of smoke. It came amid fears of military conflict along the Demilitarised Zoneafter the Kim regime threatened to take actionNorth Korean defectors went ahead with a campaign to send propaganda leaflets into the North. North Koreaaposs KCNA state news agency said the liaison office, which had been closed since January over fears of the novel coronavirus, was tragically ruined with a terric explosion.The office, when it was operating, effectively served as an embassy for the old rivals and its destruction represents a major setback to efforts by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to coax the North into cooperation. South Koreaaposs national security council convened an emergency meeting on Tuesday and said South Korea will sternly respondNorth Korea continues to raise tensions. The destruction of the office broke the expectations of all people who hope for the development of inter-Korean relations and lasting peace on the peninsula, deputy national security adviser Kim You-geun told a briefing. Weaposre making clear that the North is entirely responsible for all the consequences this might cause, he said. Tension has been rising over recent days with North Korea threatening to cut ties with South Korea and retaliate over the propaganda leaflets, which carry messages critical of Kim, including on human rights. The demolition was unprecedented in inter-Korean relations and a nonsensical act that should have not happened, South Korean vice unication minister Suh Ho, who co-headed the liaison office, told reporters. KCNA said the office was blown up to force human scum and those, who have sheltered the scum, to pay dearly for their crimes. North Korea refers to defectors as human scum. A South Korean military source told Reuters that there had been signs North Korea was going ahead with the demolition earlier in the day, and South Korean military officials watched live surveillance imagery as the building was blown up.The first diplomatic mission of its kind, the inter-Korean liaison office was established in  as part of a series of projects aimed at reducing tensions between the two Koreas. The building had been originally used as offices for managing operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint venture between the two Koreas that was suspended in  amid disagreement over the Northaposs nuclear and missile programmes. South Korea spent at least . billion wonin  to renovate the building, which stood as a gleaming blue glass structure in the otherwise drab industrial city. When it was operating, South Koreans worked on the second floor and North Koreans on the fourth floor. The third floor held conference rooms for meetings between the two sides.  When the office was closed in January, South Korea said it had  personnel stationed there. On Saturday, North Korean state media reported that Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, who serves as a senior official of the ruling Workersapos Party, had ordered the department in charge of inter-Korean affairs to decisively carry out the next action. Before long, a tragic scene of the useless north-south joint liaison office completely collapsed would be seen, she was reported as saying. Earlier on Tuesday, North Korean state media quoted the military as saying it has been studying an action plan to re-enter zones that had been demilitarised under a  inter-Korean pact and turn the front line into a fortress.

People do this because they love it.#It#s maybe dferent in bigger cities where there#s more money to be made, but somewhere the size of Dundee people do it because they love the music.#Eventhe venue is allowed to re-open without social distancing, there could be a lull where they have no bookings, because touring acts are arranged three to six months in advance.And Mark is also concerned that come the time when venues start to open up again, there may be a reluctance among the public toto gigs.He said: #I think we are lucky in that quite a lot of what we do is student-oriented and a Music Trust survey showed the younger ones are more likely to come out straight away.#But as a venue we need all those dferent parts to survive, so the older crowd could be more hesitant and it#s that fear that you could hit the wall because you can#t attract that element.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

We now need to find a new home and urgently.#Bob Smith, who runs the second hand record store Aberdeen Vinyl at Aberdeen Market said the Market Village Company’s fall into administration came as a “surprise” and he had “no idea” there were any issues.He said he is still digesting the situation and is considering the future for his business.Bob said: “It did come as a surprise in the sense that we had no idea they were in trouble.“We are thinking on our feet.  We’ve been around a long time and we will find another way to retail.“There were rumours about this last week but it is now all official.“There is a never good time for something like this to happen.”Aberdeen Market was constructed in the #s as a replacement for Archibald Simpson’s New Market, which was built in the early ’s.The original market ran from Market Street to East Green but was demolished because British Home Stores bought the site on Union Street and wanted to expand.The new market opened for the first time in November .The building was officially opened by Sir William McEwan Younger at the unveiling ceremony.Younger was a well-known Scottish brewer and political activist.The new market would struggle to retain the popularity of its predecessor with many of the stalls and shop units falling empty, and in  it was given a £, facelt.A state-of-the-art CCTV system and a new paint job in  for the Union Street entrance, which had been blighted by graffiti, was aimed at helping to help ensure the Aberdeen Market had a healthy future.German art duo Herakut painted a dramatic painting on the outside of the building as part of the first Nuart Festival in .In April , the city council backed a planning application to completely revamp the market.The new “lantern-shaped” building would house offices, retail space, cafes, a business lounge and car parking, as well as public realm space.Adrian Watson from Aberdeen Inspired wished the traders from Aberdeen Market all the best for their future plans.He said: #Whilst respecting there are ambitious plans in the offing for re-developing the site, this is clearly an unsettling development for the people and the businesses currently in the New Market, with many having dutully served their customers for a number of years.#We all understand there are particularly challenging times for retail and we naturally wish all those affected the very best.#Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said it was “sad” that a major part of the city’s retail offering looked like it would not reopen.He said: #Aberdeen market has been a feature of the city centre for decades so it#s sad to see it placed into liquidation.“While we know plans were in place for the market#s redevelopment, it#s vital that the council now works to support the local traders affected.”George Street and harbour councillor Michael Hutchison said it was #worrying# that the retailers based at the market were facing a #perilous# few weeks and months.He said: #For generations Aberdeen Market has been helping new business start up in this city. It#s therefore worrying that we#re at a point where both the building and the entity face perilous futures.#The small independent businesses in this market are part of what make Aberdeen unique and the market plays almost as important a role in our culture as it does in our economy.#My first concerns are for the market traders who will now face uncertain futures but we also need to give thought to how we can maintain those opportunities for future start-ups.#North-east Conservative MSP Tom Mason said: #The lockdown has exposed how brittle Aberdeen#s high street can be, as businesses wait to reopen.#But there is cause for optimism as le begins to normal.#Business and bustle is going to come back soon and people will be looking for places to spend their time and money.#Union Street and new developments will be key to that resurgence.#According to their Companies House entry The Market Village Limited is based in Merseyside and it was established in .Administrator Cowgills declined to comment.Aberdeen Market is owned by property firm Patrizia but a spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the situation.It understood the move into administration will have any impact on their redevelopment plans for the site.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"west coast review 5","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsHere#s the June issue of The West Coast Review!"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll golf clubs tee off as lockdown eases","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs across the region are planning to re-open on a limited basis on Friday May , following the latest Scottish Government guidance.Lochgilphead Golf Club#s course will be open to members only in the first instance and members must pre-book tee times in line with Scottish Golf guidelines.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

The incredible bravery of the st Highland Division, which remained on the continent after the Dunkirk evacuations and were eventually overrun at St Valéry-en-Caux, has largely been forgotten.Heavily involved in the St Valéry rearguard action was the th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, with young men from all over Argyll in its ranks.Surrounded by the enemy, many were killed and yet more captured, to spend the rest of the war in brutal prisoner of war camps in Germany and Poland.One young Argyll soldier was Donald McLellan from Lochgilphead.

After basic training in Aldershot, they were sent with the st Highland Division to northern France with the British Expeditionary Force to help defend the Maginot Line.The force was no match for Hitler#s blitzkreig and the British and French were forced to retreat to the channel ports, but a number of troops, including the st Highland Division, fought a continuous rearguard action against superior forces.Lance Corporal Donald McLellan was killed in action on June   at the age of .

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet-restarts-flights-full-list-destinations-can-fly","story":"Heres a round-up ofeverything you need to know.When did Easyjet restart flights Easyjet relaunched its flights from  airports across Europe for the first time on Monday, June , since they were halted at the end of March due to the coronavirus pandemic.The first flight from the UK took off on Monday morning from London Gatwick at am for Glasgow, which was the same flight path the airline first took when it launched in November .What destinations is Easyjet flying to Easyjet will be offering a reduced roster of destinations available for passengers - the plan is to be able to fly  per cent of its normal , routes in July, and  per cent in August.While there will be fewer flights on offer, travellers will have their pick of flights to domestic, city and beach destinations.These are all the destinations available from the Easyjet summer  flying programme:The airline confirmed that flights will resume from airports across the UK, these include:What are the increased safety measures for staff and passengers Easyjet has introduced extra safety measures in order to keep staff and passengers safe during their flights.Additional cleaning and disinfection procedures for aircraft cabins will be in place, with every aircraft subject to a daily disinfection process.All passengers and crew will be required to wear masks at all times.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it. To watch him on screen, yoursquod never think Bogarde was the man to cope with such a noisome task. If for any reason it suddenly becomes a necessary chore in our cottage, Irsquoll be with the Gallowgate evacuees, heading straight back to the flushing loos of the Merchant City.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The Government is rudderless, drting making contradictory decisions or no decisions at all.Boris Johnson had nothing sensible to say about the Black Lives Matter demos which drove a coach and horses through the lockdown. He could either have endorsed the protests as legitimate on moral grounds, or called on the police to enforce the law. He did neither until forced to. Leadership was lacking.The belated introduction of a -day quarantine for travellers to Britain seems like a self-destructive exercise in closing the door after the viral horse has bolted. His Government is cancelling border checks on the , lorries that enter the UK every day, while also saying that the Brexit transition period will not be extended.:Nicola Sturgeon: Boris Johnson putting political interests ahead of the public interestJohnson is accused of allowing children in England to go to theme parks but not to schools, leading to further problems for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The two-metre rule is causing massive problems as the economy tanks, yet the medical evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory.But the most serious accusation made last week against Boris Johnson was that he was asleep at the wheel in early March, and that his dilatory behaviour led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.The claim was made by the former SAGE member, Professor Neil Ferguson .ldquoHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier, the Imperial College epidemiologist told MPs last week, ldquowersquod have reduced the final death toll by at least half.In other words,the UK Government had closed the schools and shops on March  instead of March , the official death toll might have been , instead of ,. This retrospectively validates Fergusonrsquos own forecast back in March that, on his model, lockdown should have kept the death toll to around ,.I think most now accept that the UK did just about everything wrong in its response to Covid-. We didnrsquot close the borders, didnrsquot protect care homes, abandoned testing and locked down too late. The question is: who is to blame for all this The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, in ldquoThe Covid Catastrophe which is to be published this week, names the guilty man: Boris Johnson. He failed to attend crucial meetings of COBRA, the Cabinet crisis committee, failed to listen to scientists, and thought the country should ldquotake it on the chin in order to protect the economy.But it was not just the PM who delayed lockdown by one week. This was also the policy of the Scottish Government.I happened to be in the Scottish parliament on March , the day that Leo Varadkar announced the closure of schools and universities in Ireland. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Nicola Sturgeon explained why she was not following suit. She was, she insisted, ldquofollowing the science.School children sent home were likely to take the disease into their communities and to older people, ldquowhich might be a greater risk in terms of spread of infection than their being in school. She also said that parents would have to stay at home to look after them and this would denude staff for essential services like the NHS.:London Protests: More than  arrested as Boris Johnson condemns far-right protests as lsquoracist thuggeryrsquoIt all seemed sensible at the time. The national clinical director, Jason Leitch, was all over the media saying that the vast majority of us were going to get the virus anyway, because there was no vaccine, and that we had to ldquoprotect the vulnerable as it ldquoworked its way through the population.The release of SAGE minutes two weeks ago confirms that the scientic advisers were at best cool about lockdown. They may not have been in thrall to heartless herd immunity, but they did believe that trying to suppress the virus would be counterproductive.On March , the minutes say \"SAGE was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress the spread of Covid- will cause a second peak.It added that it was ldquoa near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.The scientic consensus was that eradication of the disease was not possible because it would spread until herd immunity ndash % of the population ndash finally burned the virus out. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, took a dferent view. She closed the borders immediately cases appeared and kept them closed, and imposed a severe lockdown internally and suppressed the virus until it disappeared. Last week she declared victory over Covid .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"description\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media gHqFBAP poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests gHqFBAP.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Only time will tell whether SAGE was right. There may indeed be a second wave and New Zealand will have very little immunity to it. Borders cannot be kept closed forever. However, the minutes seem to confirm that, as Professor Lawrence Freedman argued in the New Statesman, ldquothe Government was largely following SAGErsquos advice.Some have claimed that Nicola Sturgeon wanted to follow dferent advice and was overruled by Westminster. That isnrsquot the case. The First Minister was following the same scientic advice as Westminster, and made clear she did not believe lockdown was yet necessary or desirable on March .Itrsquos hard to believe that a weekrsquos delay could have led to , deaths, as many as on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Scientists will debate this for years.Indeed, analysts in Bristol, led by the mathematical modeller Professor Simon Wood, now claim now that the disease peaked before lockdown was introduced, suggesting that SAGE was right.SAGE had always argued, as the minutes show, that the best way to contain the spread was hand washing, social distancing, and protecting the old and vulnerable. The UK Government was only persuaded of lockdown by Neil Fergusonrsquos infamous forecast, on March , that without it , would die.The one thing we have learned from coronavirus is that science is not a monolith and that scientists disagree as much as politicians. All of which makes little dference to the state of the PMrsquos popularity, which dropped dramatically during Cummingsgate and has not recovered.Tory commentators are whispering that Johnson has lost it, doesnrsquot look well.

Romanichal Gypsies along with other itinerants and \"undesirables\" were shipped from Henry VIIIs time as slaves to the colonies, some sold to freed blacks in the West Indies. On slavery few historically have clean hands.For two centuries, the Colliers and SaltersAct  made all miners de facto slaves of mine owners until released or death. More than , Britons from coastal areas were enslaved by the Barbary Corsairs over three centuries until the mid-th ndash to say nothing of the three centuries of Scandinavian and Irish Viking slave raids.In counterbalance, Britain remains the only world nation to establish a military force to destroy international slavery, the Royal Navys West Africa Squadron, which over years freed over   black slaves.The notion of black slavery reparations seems to me to be white middle-class virtue signalling at its worst.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.LIKE many people, I am sure, I have felt somewhat ambivalent at the sight of statues being toppled or public monuments being defaced as part of the anti-racist movement sweeping the world. While sharing the sentiments of those directly involved, I canrsquot help feeling that there has to be a better, less crude way of highlighting the vile past behaviour of some of our most prominent fellow countrymen. They should indeed be named and shamed but does removing a statue erected in their \"honour\" really achieve anything other than erasing them from the historical record in the most visible way As a retired teacher, I firmly believe that the educational process offers a much more fruitful and positive way ahead. Many schools recognise and honour the sacrices of our young men ndash whilst highlighting the folly of war ndash by organising regular trips to the First World War battlefields and cemeteries. Similarly, the funded programme of annual visits to Auschwitz involving groups of secondary pupils has been an extremely powerful way of ensuring that one of the most horric episodes in human history is never forgotten.With respect to slavery, in the absence of a suitable \"location\" to visit, a dferent approach could be adopted. All of our major cities ndash particularly those that benefited the most from the slave trade ndash should have a permanent exhibition charting in full detail the history of the slave trade . This would, ideally, be housed within an existing museum already benefiting from an established footfall. Pupils from all primary and secondary schools would be invited to visit on a structured, educational visit as part of a unit of work which would be a compulsory inclusion in the curriculum. In this way, all of our young people would benefit from a true and accurate account of this most nefarious period in our history. The phrase \"lest we forget\" applies equally well in this context.Rob Kelly, Bearsden.WITH the current national protests associated with the injustice of slavery and transportation of black slaves from West Africa to British colonies to harvest sugar in the plantations, it has been interesting to reflect on the Scottish connections.What is little known, however, is the inclusion of Scots, as slaves, in this period of history.In  more than  Scots were being sent to the West Indies as slaves from Edinburgh. The small ship sank in a storm off Orkney. The men had no chance as they were allowed to drown, battened below in the hold.Their crime was that they were Covenanters, unwilling to accept bishops in their Scottish Presbyterian faith, imposed by the established Episcopalian Church. Hunted down, they resorted to having church services in fields, particularly in the south of Scotland. Some were tied to stakes and allowed to drown slowly in the rising tide of the Solway Firth.My interest is that my ancestors, John and James Kirk, were two of the slaves drownedPerhaps we should accept that we cannot change history, just learn from it.John Kirk Ewing, Ayr.THE vandalising of Robert the Bruces statue at Bannockburn on the bogus grounds that he was a racist is instructive as well as disgraceful.The attack on Bruces statue when he lived  years ago and almost certainly never even saw an African person shows that this has nothing to do with racism.Instead, we have to look at the wider pattern. Statues of Churchill and Lincoln have been vandalised in London, and of Robert Dundas in Edinburgh. A bronze of Lord Baden-Powell is under guard in Poole. When even Queen Victorias statue in Leeds has been attacked, it is clear that it is sufficient to be famous, dead and white.The real objective of these attacks is to erase our cultural identity. If these acts were done by foreigners, they would be recognised as genocidal in intent.We should concede nothing to the extremists using the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis as cover for attempted Maoist cultural revolution.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.OH that people would learn some history before pegging trivial debating points on wild mis-statements. Robert Bruce did not gain the Scottish crown by cold-blooded murder. His slaying of John Comyn, which is what I assume Duncan Soomanhas in mind, was recognised at the time as a killing committed in the heat of passion: a crime and a sin, of course, but a much lesser one than premeditated murder. Both church and secular laws in mediaeval times were perfectly clear about the moral and legal distinction. All recent historians concur in this interpretation of Brucersquos act.Furthermore, far from gaining him the Scottish crown, the killing made his eventual success in this even more astonishing, since it plunged him into a full-scale civil war in Scotland on top of the ongoing war with England. The fact that this was an entirely predictable consequence of Comynrsquos death is pretty conclusive proof that the killing was not premeditated.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.Read more: Letters: British state should pay reparations"},{"url":null,"title":"new-zealand-records-two-new-cases-covid-19-country-eradicated-virus","story":"But before they were tested, the women had been given an exemption to leave quarantine on compassionate grounds and had travelled from Auckland to Wellington by car.:New Zealand eradicates coronavirusDirector-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said that as part of their travel plan, the women had no contact with any people or any public facilities on their road trip.Nevertheless, the new cases have sparked a round of testing in New Zealand for anybody who might have been close to the women.That includes passengers and staff on their flights, which arrived via Brisbane in Australia, other people at the Auckland hotel they initially stayed at in quarantine, and a family member they met in Wellington.:Jacinda Ardern turned away from cafe as social distancing limits capacityThe women remain in isolation in Wellington and have delayed the funeral of their parent until they have recovered.Until Tuesday, New Zealand had gone more than three weeks without any new cases and had declared that everybody who had contracted the virus had recovered, aside from the  people who died."},{"url":null,"title":"unemployment-figures-number-people-uk-payrolls-drops-600-000-coronavirus-lockdown","story":"The Office for National Statistics says the first full month of lockdown saw an increase in unemployment, while the number of vacancies fell to a record low.Unemployment rose by , to , in Scotland between March and May.The jobless rate in the three months up to April was .%, which is an increase of .% on the previous quart, and above the UKs rate of .%.Business, Fair Work and Skills Minister Jamie Hepburn said: \"These are the first labour market statistics to include a full month of lockdown measures, and show clearly the scale of the challenge facing Scotland as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Workers on UK payrolls tumble and benefit claims soar during lockdown\",\"description\": \"UK workers on company payrolls slumped by more than , between March and May and benefit claims soared by . million as the coronavirus lockdown hammered Britain us labour market, official figures have revealed. r nCredit: PA\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media xuglBPg poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests xuglBPg.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": \"I know that many people will be feeling a deep sense of anxiety about their livelihoods.

This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance.

The film follows a group of four young misfits as they set out to find the treasure of a long-lost pirate on their last weekend living in their under-threat neighbourhood.A noisy, high-energy and light-hearted watch, it was the perfect feelgood film for a sunny Sunday evening amid the current doom and gloom of the world.Among the spectators were die-hard fans of the movie, Nicky Kells and Michelle Currie. and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Nicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from Ballynure FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from BallynureThe couple, who travelled from Ballynure for the occasion, say they were glad of the excuse to leave the house and have some sense of normality for the evening.We love The Goonies, it#s one of my favourite movies. To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen in early July as no new deaths confirmedBelfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollStatues of King Billy and Sir Hans Sloane targeted over links to slaveryTributes to motocross fan Brendan Graham, discovered dead at Desertmartin trackNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Travellers are feeling the impact, but sotoo are pilots and flight attendants. #It#s hard after  years to write up my CV and think where it leads to outside aviation#Former Flybe pilot Nigel Best , from Ballymena, has worked for the airline for  years and transferred from his role as an engineer to become a pilot six years ago. He is married with two children and a grandson. He worked in Michelin as an apprentice after leaving school and then became an apprentice engineer in the RAF.I served for  years with the RAF and then joined Jersey European as a CAA licensed engineer. I did that for  years, but I always had my pilot#s licence and I built upon that and became a flight instructor, he says.Nigel says initial flight training costs £,: It#s a big investment. When you are a pilot it#s not just like you get a licence like a driving licence. Every six months you#ve got to do a simulator test and there are always tests and evaluations. My licence now will only last for a year and I will have to renew it at my own expense.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNigel Best  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNigel Best On his days off he also worked at Woodgate Aviation for the Air Ambulance on a voluntary basis.After six years as a pilot his last flight was on March , bringing passengers from Manchester into Belfast.I know everybody puts so much effort into their job, but everybody within Flybe, from the cabin crew and engineer to the pilots, worked so hard. It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

It must remain below one to avoid exponential growth.The briefing paper states that modelling suggests that R remains signicantly below  at present.

This will depend on public compliance with any restrictions, policy decisions and other factors such as the behaviour of the virus and the development of effective treatments or a vaccine.Health officials have used modelling to show what would happen#R# rose to ., . or . from June , and measures to suppress the epidemic were not taken or were ineffective. The modelling extends to the end of .It states:If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early October with close to  patients requiring ICU support in early October. Under this scenario, modelling suggests four-week restrictions may need to be put in place in mid-August, late October and then February .If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early December, with over  patients requiring ICU support.The paper notes that in either scenario deaths would be much greater than in wave one of the epidemic.If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would still be increasing at the end of  and over  patients would be in critical care.Mr Swann praised society#s herculean efforts to stem the virus, but warned complacency remains the biggest enemy in the continuing battle against Covid-.It is impossible to stress enough that this terrible disease, which has already claimed the lives of so many of our loved ones, has not gone away, he said.It remains ready to strike again, perhaps with even greater ferocity than before.We only have to look at the modelling, which was released recently by my department, to see that as we emerge from this phase of the pandemic, we most do so with caution and an appreciation that the war is far from won.Previous modelling at the outset of the pandemic predicted , deaths in what Mr Swann described as a nightmare, worst case scenario.

Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford championed the call but was rebuffed on Monday.On Tuesday, Downing Street confirmed it would provide vouchers for children for the six weeks of their summer break in England.

Whilst the Department for Communities has lead responsibility for vulnerable families, no single department has the lead on food poverty and holiday hunger.It will be for the Executive to decide on the way forward over the summer holidays and make provision for the necessary funding to support any interventions. The Department for Communities has announced a number of additional measures to provide food and assistance to vulnerable groups and we continue to work closely with them to ensure food is available to these vulnerable children.

At the beginning of this year the Derry News revealed that the Trust had implemented a three-year ‘financial recovery plan’ to address a poundm deficit. Finance Director Neil Guckian said the Western Trust was the only Trust in Northern Ireland with such measures in place. By February of this year the overall deficit had been reduced to around poundm. Of that total, poundm is a direct consequence of cuts over the past six years and the remaining ten is due to investment in additional staff because of safety concerns or service growth, and the extra cost of delivering existing services such as locums. googletag.cmd.push A poundm financial and efficiency recovery plan had been agreed for   which would leave around poundm to save in the final year,  . Cost saving areas identied included the recruitment of locum or temporary doctors which soared to poundm in  . Speaking at a media briefing on June , Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said that due to the pandemic the financial recovery plan has been ‘put to one side’. “The priority has been to respond to COVID and take whatever steps we needed to take, whether that involved staffing, PPE and other aspects of services. “So essentially we have paused our recovery programme because of the COVID pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “That doesn’t mean that we are less attentive to running the business, we run the business of our organisation as efficiently and effectively as we can. “But the actual detail of the recovery plan has been set to one side during this period.” The cost of running health services during the pandemic has risen dramatically with the rise in PPE usage and need for enhanced cleaning schedules in all health and social care settings. In April, Mr Guckian said the Trust would normally use , fluid resistant surgical masks per day. That increased to , a day at the beginning of the pandemic, then , and at the height of the pandemic to ,-, masks in a single week.

At a meeting of the Western Trust Board on June , Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen provided a snapshot of community services by reading out an email from a community team leader based at Great James Street. In it the worker said: “All the publicity has been about the efforts within the hospital, and quite rightly too, but the hospital didn’t get the expected the surge from COVID-. “However, the volume of work in both our services in the community has been huge and much more intense than usual. googletag.cmd.push “I know the health visiting team are exhausted, this rate of work can’t be maintained, and we’re not going to get any relief as our services are stepping up now again.” The worker explained that staff had pulled together as a team and embraced new ways of working, at one stage managing a % reduction in staff numbers. She said: “This crisis has expedited the process of our team getting smart phones and from the feedback it has made a huge dference in being able to interact with families, especially safeguarding families.

Health visitors were ringing families at home with each call lasting about  to  minutes longer than a home visit might have taken.” Health visitors were contacting more families with a total of , calls for home visits completed in April for the Derry, Limavady and Strabane areas. Dr Kilgallen continued reading the email: “They start making them before am and are working consistently throughout the day, one after another which is much more intense. “They also have the worry that many of the safeguarding families are not being seen, they are being tele-linked and that’s harder and very tiring. “We had health visitor redeployed into the hospital therefore leaving vacant caseloads but those on the ground are working to cover those vacant caseloads so there isn’t a backlog.” The team leader went on to speak about the community midwery services who experienced a high volume of work with an increase in the number of antenatal bookings.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding will be discussed at tomorrow nights meeting of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Leisure and Development Committee at Cloonavin, with a report recommending its approval. The LCF is a tax credit scheme that allows landfill operators to use some landfill tax to directly fund projects that improve the lives of communities living within a ten-mile radius of their site. Demand on the scheme was so high that although twelve of the fteen applicants were deemed eligible, funding was allocated for the three highest scorers. googletag.cmd.push St Matthew’s GAC, Drumsurn and Limavady Cricket and Rugby Football Club are among the three organisations who are set to benefit from the funding package. St Matthew’s are to receive pound, for the enhancement of their community premises, while Limavady Cricket  Rugby FC will receive pound, towards the installation of female changing and shower facilities. Limavady Cricket and Rugby Football Club are also hoping to benefit from the funding.  Causeway Coast and Glens councillor for Limavady, Brenda Chivers, welcomed the funding for both clubs. “I welcome all of the assessments and scores for the funding under the LCF scheme, particularly the scoring of St Matthew’s GAC, Drumsurn to advance their facility there,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Limavady Cricket and Rugby Football Club are putting in female changing and showering facilities and given the rise of participation, particularly in rugby, of the female teams, this is timely and very welcome.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community.

reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense. However, there will be concern about this project across the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Sam helping lift spirits with nursing home gigs  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH musician is lting the spirits of residents at a local nursing home mdash despite the Coronavirus lockdown and heart surgery.For over  years Sam Miskelly has been entertaining the residents of Fishbourne House at Spa, with his accordion.However, his weekly visits were put on hold after he underwent heart surgery several months ago and had stents fitted.He recovered only for the Covid- virus to spread around the globe, which meant he was no longer to go inside the home.Undaunted, the  year-old former lorry driver now sets up his accordion, amplier and microphone in the garden of the nursing home and residents are still able to enjoy his tuneful medleys.Sam is a regular performer at old tyme dances at a number of local venues and it was at one of them where he met Mr William Brown, owner of Fishbourne House.ldquoOne night he asked meI would play music for the residents.

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That is what happens when whole tiers of economic activity have to shut .Explanations are needed as to the wisdom of some uses of taxpayer or ratepayer funds in this crisis, such as NI councils topping up the UK’s very generous furlough scheme so that the income of council employees on the scheme was untouched. Transparency is all the more important when there are huge demands on the public purse and when government will be essential to the recovery and must be wisely spent.Now is an obvious time to improve infrastructure. It puts money in the economy, it employs people and it leaves society with a lasting asset. Some critics will want to demote road building, given that people around the world have enjoyed the way lockdown has led to less traffic and less polluted cities. But that does not mean we should reject the car, when we can instead embrace new technologies such as electric vehicles. The road upgrades that Nichola Mallon says her infrastructure department will now advance across Northern Ireland are all needed. The A plan removes deadly gap junctions on that part of the Belfast-Dublin road, which is substandard compared to the motorway it links on to south of the border. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The Newry southern relief road will greatly alleviate a congested section of that city.Mrs Mallon has re-committed to the A and A upgrades, which will greatly improve movement around the Province.Other key future schemes include the Yorkgate junction upgrade, which is at an advanced stage of planning , and a dual carriageway from Moira to Templepatrick, past Belfast International Airport, which regrettably is barely on the radar.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The Protocol was the compromise that avoided a no deal exit, it is vital now that the EU and UK work together to protect the peace and prosperity of those who will be impacted by it - the businesses and consumers of Northern Ireland. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The Protocol is only one part of the jigsaw, and companies will have their heads in their hands about the worrying lack of progress following the latest round of talks. Anxiety is mounting amongst the Northern Irish business community that, let’s face it, has little resilience to spare.As we’ve begun to take the first tentative steps into the recovery phase, every decimal point of economic growth has to be fought for.With limited growth plaguing Northern Ireland’s economy for years, long before this current crisis emerged, the task is more urgent than ever before. The bottom line is getting a good Brexit deal for our economy is essential.That’s why businesses across the UK expect negotiators on both sides to approach talks with a determination to deliver.Negotiation by videoconference is far from perfect, preventing the kind of side-line conversations that can help smooth dferences in formal talks. Even more limiting is adhering to rigid negotiating mandates. Unless the dynamic shts in this latest round of accelerated talks, it looks like both sides will stay trapped in a holding pattern, with no trade deal a real possibility at the end of the year, when the transition period is scheduled to end. For businesses, jobs and economic confidence in this most challenging of years, that would be a shocking outcome which must not come to pass.For many Northern Irish firms fighting to survive, the idea of preparing for a chaotic change in trading relations with Great Britain in seven months is beyond them. They aren’t remotely prepared. Stockpiles built to weather a Brexit storm are long depleted and supply chains are fragmented by an unprecedented global pandemic. Many NI businesses, especially smaller ones, have burned through cash reserves they would have otherwise used for rainy days. On top of this, the support from the Jobs Retention Scheme and rates relief will be coming to an end for many businesses.The net impact of no deal would be higher unemployment at a time when we will be fighting for every job. Signicant losses, particularly in our manufacturing, retail and hospitality sectors, would simply be devastating for local communities and our economy.For everyone’s sake, the Protocol taking effect in a clf-edge scenario is not the answer. What is more, Northern Ireland will not benefit from the proposed flexibilities on post-transition border controls on goods, announced last week by the UK government.So, what needs to happen now Political leaders across Europe have shown in recent months that what previously may have been thought of as impossible, is not. They need to use that determination and leadership to find a route through in the talks.This must continue, building upon the conversation yesterday between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.The global pandemic could end up claiming many jobs in Northern Ireland, and possibly millions across these islands. The stakes are higher than ever before. Walking away with no deal would be a major block to recovery. It would worsen inequalities, damaging regional and national growth. Many businesses are not – and cannot – prepare for the impact of no deal on top of what is happening.The UK Government has repeatedly ruled out an extension to the transition period, which means firms therefore have no choice but to plan on that basis. But that means a deal is now the only acceptable option.A good deal with the EU with a sustainable agreement on the implementation of the Protocol is necessary for renewal. As businesses start to get up and dust themselves off, and as we sht from revive to recover, a recovery plan that reaches all parts of Northern Ireland is essential. Every opportunity for growth must be seized, particularly to support young people and kick-start demand.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, despite the terms of the contract having been torn apart by the Audit Office and the Assembly’s public accounts committee in , the deal with BT was extended to run until at least  – and civil servants are now negotiating yet another extension beyond that date.Mr Donnelly accepted that BT had performed well in delivering the project but found that it was making exorbitants, while the department was also benefiting from inflated fees, something he said was “an indirect local tax”.Although officials had secured some improvement in terms when they renegotiated the deal, Mr Donnelly said that to this day “LPS customers nonetheless continue to pay too much for the services provided”. He said that “users of the LandWeb Registration Services are being overcharged as the Fees Order  is out of date with fees set too high”, yet the Department of Finance has shown no urgency in updating the fees.Mr Donnelly, who played an important role in bringing the RHI scandal to public attention, found that the way in which the BT contract was extended “is indicative of poor strategic planning by the department”.BT makes its money from the fees the public pay for accessing the Landweb system. When the contract was let, it was estimated that the company would receive £ million. However, that sum has more than doubled to almost £ million a year ago – and continues to rise.Mr Donnelly was critical of the renegotiation of the contract when it could have been ended, noting that the department still does not have full transparency on BT’s profits and scant evidence of how the public has benefited from the renegotiation.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

He suggested that in these exceptional circumstances quick decisions are essential to suit local issues.“This is highlighted by the recent decision by the Minister for Infrastructure to ask councils to relax the rules for on-street cafes and bars and also the Department’s investigation into potential widening of pavements to help with social distancing.”“The decision to provide more flexibility on pavement use is welcomed, subject to ensuring disabled access is maintained, and greater pedestrianisation is something that is increasingly seen as a way to help revitalise our towns. But without visibility of these decisions or the processes, timescales and likelihood of funding it is extremely dficult to plan.”“I believe that strategic planning of transport, funding decisions and the development of our townscapes will have a huge bearing on the success of our economic recovery. For example, I believe that a new railway station and park and ride facility in the Rushmere area of Craigavon could create an economic development and sustainable transport hub which would benefit the wider area, including those travelling from Armagh.”“Connectivity is key and enhanced transport links with Belfast and Dublin, the strategic development of the A corridor in Banbridge, and sustainable linkages to build our tourism sector could create new jobs and opportunities. Successfully connecting people and places.”“However, the correct powers and funding decisions are needed to deliver any strategic plan and vision.”“A closer partnership arrangement between councils and the Executive Departments would be a good start. But in these unprecedented times, where pressure is building on businesses, jobs and our citizens there could well be a clamour for greater local control.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccdfbbecafcec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adabcbdbbbed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
