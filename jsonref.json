called for a new ‘war powers’ law to give parliament more scrutiny before military action is taken, after the UK joined the US and France in Syrian airstrikes.The Labour leader has questioned the legality of the bombings, saying he did not accept the strikes were justified on humanitarian grounds.Missile strikes were launched in the early hours of Saturday morning on suspected chemical weapons sites believed to be run by the Assad regime.Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when chlorine gas and another nerve agent was used in a chemical attack in Douma, Syria, on April 7.‘I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by parliament for what they do in our name,’ Corbyn told Andrew Marr.The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a ‘proxy war’ between the US and Russia.He said chlorine has been used by ‘a number of parties in the conflict’ in Syria as a weapon.If Britain wants to ‘get the moral high ground around the world’, Corbyn said, it must abide by international law for taking military action.‘Where is the legal basis for this?’ he asked.‘I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.A Syrian firefighter is seen inside the destroyed Scientific Research Centre in Damascus, Syria, on April 14, 2018 (Picture: Reuters)‘If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire.‘That surely would save a lot of lives.’Theresa May has faced low public support for bombing Syria without Parliament’s backing.The first poll carried out after the airstrikes showed that the public believe May’s action was wrong by a majority of almost two to one.The PM will go before the Commons tomorrow to explain why she ordered British cruise missile attacks on Syria as part of a joint operation with the United States and France."},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/jenna-farmer/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eJenna

keep talking about what life is like with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.IBS is common – it’s thought one in five of us could suffer with it at some point during our lifetime.But because of its growing prominence, it can sometimes mean patients are labelled with the condition before being properly tested for other conditions instead.Because it’s incredibly important to be in the know, this IBS Awareness month, let’s take a moment to consider what else could be up with your gut.IBD is rarer than IBS (and a serious disease that often requires long-term medication).While IBD often involves bleeding and weight-loss, it also shares some symptoms with IBS, such as diarrhoea and stomach pain, so it’s not uncommon for those with IBD to be misdiagnosed as IBS for years beforehand.The only true way to eliminate IBD is by a colonoscopy so talk to your GP and visit Crohn’s and Colitis UK for more information.Problems with lactose are becoming more common, whether it’s temporary after a bout of food poisoning or long-term.Lactose intolerance, which manifests itself as bloating and diarrhoea, is probably best identified by keeping a detailed food diary but your GP may offer a hydrogen breath test too.Meaning there are many people with the condition clueless that they’re symptoms, such as anaemia, bloating, constipation, skin rashes, diarrhoea and mouth ulcers to name but a few, are because of coeliac disease.Coeliac disease is diagnosed via blood test and an endoscopy, but it’s crucial to keep eating gluten until you are diagnosed with the condition.SIBO stands for Small Intestinal Bowel Overgrowth.SIBO happens when there is excessive bacteria in our small intestines and patients can suffer from nutritional deficiencies, weight loss and chronic diarrhoea as a result.Common symptoms of bowel cancer, as well as tummy pain, are bleeding from the bottom or blood in your poo, unexplained weight loss, extreme tiredness for no obvious reason and a change in bowel habits lasting three weeks or more.Bowel Cancer is extremely treatable when diagnosed early but because many people put their symptoms down to other conditions, diagnosis is delayed.Keep informed via Bowel Cancer UK and chat to your doctor if something doesn’t feel right.No, IBS is NOT in your head.But people suffering from stress can mistake their body’s natural reaction to worry and anxiety as IBS.These symptoms can resolve when the stressful period is over – so don’t underestimate the power of our mind.One symptom of endometriosis is often strong abdominal pain and, because of this, it’s often misdiagnosed as IBS.If you also experience bladder difficulties and pain during sex, it could be endometriosis.Visit Endometriosis UK for guidance and support.This painful condition is more common in elderly folks, occurring when small pockets develop in the intestine’s lining.What’s worrying about erticulitis is that many people don’t experience any symptoms.But those who do experience severe pain, nausea and high temperatures.Consult your GP if you are concerned about any of the above.Jenna Farmer has Crohn’s Disease and writes about gut health over at A Balanced Belly.MORE: ‘It’s

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

A blog on the site points out the differences between ‘sugar and prostitution’, claiming that sugar daddies and babies have an ongoing relationship, and not just a financial transaction.It also claims that women on the site are not sexually abused as in prostitution and that sex is an aspiration, not a requirement. Yet evidence from women who spoke to the MoS tells a very different story. They claim that they were treated like prostitutes after signing up.A young single mother joined SA while she was a student at a Scottish university. She wanted extra money to cover her university costs while also supporting her four-year-old daughter. What turned out to be her only dates arranged through the website were with a 56-year-old man.At their first meeting, he paid for dinner and took her to the upmarket women’s clothing shop he owned, allowing her to take home any of the expensive dresses that caught her eye. But on the second date, the mood changed after he made clear to her that on the third date he expected sex. When she declined, he became enraged and began to reel off the explicit sexual services other women he had dated through Seeking Arrangement had provided him.She said: ‘I remember a particular phrase he used. He said, “This Asian girl bent over.” I remember feeling so shocked with the realisation that he expected sex. I thought, “Oh my God, this is completely screwed up.” So I just dropped him, deleted my profile from the site and got out.#IBelieveHer protesters claim victory as Irish and Ulster...Share this article‘I was naive and I did think it was a free lunch. I thought maybe you had to be seen with these men or they wanted a date for an event, a high-class escort type thing.

In adverts for the event it says that sugar daddies, sugar babies and psychologists will all be in attendance to advise young women who attend on ‘how to bag a millionaire’.          This Cambridge PhD student said she was funding her life at university through Seeking ArrangementsShe said during the meal he plied her with copious amounts of wine, before inviting her back to his penthouse apartment where he then encouraged her to take cocaine and smoke marijuana with him.From here he cajoled her to go out on to his balcony where he forced her into a sex act with a beer bottle.On another occasion she was inundated with messages from a 70-year-old man in Brighton who offered to pay her £1,000 to have unprotected sex.The woman said she did not report the sexual assault to the police for fear of her family or friends finding out that she had sex for money.She has now left the site, but revealed the experience had left her feeling ashamed and deeply emotionally scarred. She said: ‘If a woman still thinks there is possibility of “normal dating” after signing up, she will soon understand that Seeking Arrangement and sites like it are platforms for prostitution.‘Every single interaction with men was quickly – usually after a few lines – very explicit on what they want and the price.‘All of them really quickly want nude pictures.

She set herself standards and she knew what she did and didn\u0027t want to be associated with very early on, long before Prince Harry,\u0027 explains Gina.\u0027She was always very conscious and protective of her image and rightly didn\u0027t want to do anything that would compromise that. She was already developing her role in Suits, but it was clear to me from the start that she expected to become an even bigger star.\u0027          If it is a \u0027yes\u0027 to human rights, environmentalism and gender equality – Meghan, 36, is a United Nations women\u0027s advocate – it is also a clear \u0027no\u0027 to promoting fur or animal products, and certainly a \u0027no\u0027 to anything that might make the star look, well, ordinarySay no to the SultanAn early indicator of Meghan\u0027s careful approach came on one of her first trips to the UK, where Gina and Kruger Cowne arranged for Meghan to stay at The Dorchester, the Park Lane hotel favoured by celebs and Royals.Plans were in place for Ms Markle – who insisted on using an alias even though most Britons at that point had barely heard of her – to check in for free at the five-star hotel where rooms start from £400. It was an offer for which most clients would \u0027give their eye teeth\u0027, says Gina.          Meghan Markle will join Prince Harry at two key Commonwealth events next week ahead of the Royal wedding on May 19 It came as something of a surprise to her hosts, then, when Meghan wrote to say it simply would not do. It was in conflict with her personal beliefs. The owner, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah – whose Dorchester Collection includes the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA and the Le Meurice in Paris – had recently suggested sharia punishments should be meted out to adulterers and those found to be homosexual. Women who had abortions would be flogged in public.Gina said: \u0027Meghan emailed to say she would never stay at the Dorchester, or any hotels they are involved with. We understood and of course agreed.\u0027Her stance may well have softened since meeting Prince Harry. After all, she broke her boycott last May to watch her Prince play polo at the Sultan\u0027s vast Cosworth Park estate in Ascot.And this is probably just as well as far as the Royal Family is concerned. The Sultan was a guest at the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.In December last year, Prince William welcomed the Sultan at Buckingham Palace and in November the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall made an official visit to the nation where he took tea with the Brunei Royal Family and senior government ministers.Make that picture perfectNo one understands the power of visual imagery better than Meghan, and like her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan is a keen amateur photographer, says Gina. And a painstaking one.\u0027Most photographs she put on her lifestyle blog, The Tig, were taken herself.\u0027She would see something she wanted to photograph and she would frame the shot expertly. If she was going to be in the photograph, she would hand the camera to someone and direct them, saying, \u0027Stand here and point it over there.\u0027 \u0027Let parrots fly freeIt wasn\u0027t just The Dorchester that met with a degree of disapproval. Gina remembers when Meghan checked in and out of a hotel in Knightsbridge without ever staying the night.Gina says: \u0027One time we booked her into the Jumeirah Carlton Tower and I had to meet her there to go on to a meeting.\u0027My colleague and I walked to her room and en route was this parrot sitting in a cage and Meghan looked at this parrot and looked at my colleague and said, \u0027I can\u0027t stay here because of the parrot.\u0027 She there and then checked out and went to the Soho Hotel.\u0027I realise that she\u0027s absolutely right, of course. Wild animals belong in the wild and not in cages.\u0027Tips from Harry – PotterMeghan has been determined to combine her career with humanitarian causes, particularly women\u0027s rights, and was impressed by one actress in particular – Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.\u0027On one occasion, Meghan and I attended an event where Emma, a committed feminist, was speaking,\u0027 says Gina. \u0027I could tell Meghan was quite taken with Emma\u0027s passion and commitment to her cause. I\u0027m sure she was looking at her thinking, \u0027Emma is doing this, so can I.\u0027\u0027Meghan very much wants to be a role model.\u0027Gina says that one of Meghan\u0027s greatest achievements was delivering a United Nations Women\u0027s speech in New York, where Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General at the time, stood up and thanked her and shook her hand.Meghan, whose mother Doria was in the audience, told Gina afterwards: \u0027I just could have died happy in that moment!\u0027          Miss Markle (pictured with Prince Harry at team trials for the Invictus Games in Bath) will join her fiancée at the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London on Wednesday and a Women\u0027s Empowerment reception on Thursday, hosted by the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Don\u0027t beat about the bush\u0027She absolutely knows her own mind,\u0027 recalls Gina. \u0027At one point we were putting together a proposal for a book based on her lifestyle blog The Tig and if she didn\u0027t like part of the plan, she would tell you straight out.\u0027In the end, it wasn\u0027t published because she met Harry and obviously decided it wasn\u0027t the sort of thing she should be pursuing right now.\u0027There were people in the office she didn\u0027t gel with and she said it straight, \u0027I\u0027m not working with so and so any more.\u0027 There was no beating around the bush.\u0027It could be awkward but my job is all about building relationships so I understood where she was coming from.\u0027Dream Big – it worksWas it written in the stars? Her dream of bagging a prince was certainly written in her blog, The Tig.At about the time of Kate\u0027s wedding to Prince William in 2011, she says: \u0027Little girls dream of being princesses. And grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Royal Wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.\u0027Humorous no doubt, but prophetic also. Then, referring to a popular children\u0027s cartoon, she continues: \u0027I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power.\u0027Harry might take note."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/20/4B1FF8CB00000578-0-image-a-18_1523734952921.jpg","title":"DAN HODGES PMs won Syria lost home","story":"    Theresa May is winning the battle but losing the war over SyriaTheresa May is winning the battle but losing the war over Syria. Britain’s Armed Forces have performed with predictable courage and distinction, and according to initial damage assessments have effectively degraded the conveyor-belt of death that resulted in chemical weapons being dropped on the children, women and men of Douma.But the equally vital – and increasingly vicious – struggle to convince the British people of the need for an effective response to the gangsterism of Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin is not going her way. Indeed in the fight for hearts and minds, she is currently staring defeat in the face.It was around this time last week she was informed the Syrian regime had again dipped its murderous hands in its stocks of chlorine. When she saw footage of the incident, what she focused on was how the victims were huddled in an air raid shelter. ‘Those children were trying to find safety. And Assad still went after them,’ a government official said. ‘That affected her deeply.’ And it was at that moment that Mrs May began the emotional process of preparing herself to deploy British forces in a concerted way for the first time in her premiership.Unfortunately, this instinctive and humane decision that Assad’s barbarism could not go unpunished has proved her first mistake. Because it is not currently shared by a nation exhausted by austerity, scarred by the poisonous legacy of Iraq and scared of the prospect of a direct superpower confrontation.Mrs May has been playing catch-up with public opinion. On Thursday, a YouGov opinion poll showed only 22 per cent of Britons were in favour of a missile attack on Syria’s armed forces – and almost twice as many (43 per cent) were against. And a Mail on Sunday poll today reveals the public are opposed to her decision to bypass Parliament by a factor of two to one – and a vast majority are against her doing so again.During the week she went about carefully constructing the case for intervention, and the political and diplomatic coalition to implement it. On Tuesday and Wednesday, National Security Council briefings analysed open-source material that identified Syrian helicopter activity over Douma in the moments before the attack, and pieced it together with covert intelligence revealing Syrian air-command co-ordination.‘She will never be forgotten’: Tributes are paid to...Judge slams RSPB for sidestepping law by conducting covert...Share this articleOn Thursday she presented that evidence to Cabinet and invited contributions from all Ministers. Sajid Javid reportedly made a strong case condemning the failure to intervene in 2013, while Matt Hancock impressed colleagues – and May herself – with the argument that she had the authority to launch strikes without sub-letting the decision to Parliament.On Thursday evening she spoke to Donald Trump and reached a final agreement on the decision to launch a limited, proportionate attack.Finally, at 5pm on Friday, she met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson at Chequers and signed off the specific strike packages for the RAF Tornados conducting the raids.But Mrs May neglected to engage with her most important partner of all – the British people. With the result that as UK servicemen prepared to take to the skies over the Mediterranean, their government appeared to have gone AWOL.Where Ministers should have been setting out the evidence, strategy and rationale behind military intervention, a vacuum was allowed to develop. One that was swiftly filled by everyone from the cyber-conspiracy theorists to Putin’s comical apologists and Jeremy Corbyn. Admittedly, as the week went on, the distinction between these disparate groups became harder to distinguish.But they were still easier to spot than members of the Government making a calm and compelling case for military action.There is such a case. In 2013 we were told the decision to draw back from action would spare lives. Instead, it sacrificed them. We were told a deal had been brokered between Putin and Assad to destroy Syria’s remaining chemical weapons. It was a lie. We were told negotiation offered the best path to peace. Russia’s own intervention, and selective deployment of her UN veto, shut that path down for good.But no one has been given licence to make that argument. The Prime Minister was correct, brave even, to take the decision air strikes did not need parliamentary approval – but then left Plymouth MP and former Commando Johnny Mercer to defend it in heroic isolation.On Friday she met Mercer in Downing Street where he urged her to take her arguments out into the country.Belatedly she followed his advice, mounting a solid defence of her actions at a press conference yesterday. But today that is where Mrs May remains. On the defensive.          We have now reached the incredible situation where two hostile foreign states and Her Majesty’s official opposition are operating in de-facto alliance to subvert the actions of the British GovernmentPrivately, Ministers say that now the requirements of operational security have been lifted, they are much freer to make an aggressive case for responding to Assad’s butchery. But they also concede they need to be more effective in disarming the Syria-Russia propaganda machine, or what could more accurately be called the Syria-Russia-Labour propaganda machine.We have now reached the incredible situation where two hostile foreign states and Her Majesty’s official opposition are operating in de-facto alliance to subvert the actions of the British Government.No sooner does a lie raise its head in Moscow, than it is dispersed through Vladimir Putin’s bot-farms, into the social media accounts of the Corbyn cultists and on to the Twitter pages of Labour MPs.It’s time for Mrs May to fight back. And her battlefield must not now be the skies over Syria but the Commons chamber. Tomorrow she appears in Parliament to deliver her statement on her decision to strike Assad. She, her Ministers and her party must take off the gloves and take the attack to their opponents.First, they must expose Jeremy Corbyn’s craven, self-righteous duplicity for what it is.His statements prove there is no act of brutality that will scar his conscience sufficiently for him to endorse a military response.‘Bombs won’t save lives or bring about peace,’ was his infantile reaction, implying he now supports unilateral conventional weapon disarmament along with nuclear unilateralism. Every sentence he utters has no practical purpose other than to act as a shield around Assad and his murderous regime.Corbyn does not want proportionate action – he wants no action.Then Mrs May and her colleagues must again destroy the fiction there is a ‘UN solution’ to the crisis.The pubs, supermarkets and school-runs of the nation do not echo to the sound of people delving deep into the inner workings of the UN Security Council. It needs to be explained clearly and concisely that Russia’s veto, coupled with Putin’s cynical surrogacy of Assad, makes the UN route a dead-end.Finally they must destroy the perverse fiction that inaction equates to security.If we allow maniacs such as Assad to toss chemical weapons around with impunity then it is not just Syrian children who will burn.In 2013, we failed to act because chemical weapons in the Middle East were supposedly ‘none of our business’.Five years later, they appeared on the streets of Salisbury.Last week the Prime Minister rightly took the lead in ordering British forces to redraw the red lines over the production, use and proliferation of chemical weapons. But she failed to take the British people with her. Tomorrow she must."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/04/4B198D5900000578-0-image-a-6_1523590888354.jpg","title":"Bank worker 23 toothache diagnosed leukemia","story":"    Lauren Neilly, 23, decided to book a doctor\u0027s appointment about the cut to her finger and because she was feeling generally unwellHer mother Samantha told The Daily Record: \u0027She\u0027s had her bone marrow test, and that was very painful for her, and she\u0027s started chemo.\u0027Because Ms Neilly, of Glasgow, has only worked for Barclays Bank for ten months she will only receive two months of full sick pay.Her fiancé, Ben, has nearly finished university meaning Ms Neilly has had to take on the role as main earner at home. \u0027Much love to you both\u0027: Jesinta Campbell leads tributes to...Firefighter diagnosed with a rare inoperable brain tumour...‘Will nan and grandad look after her in heaven?’:...The sisters aged two and five who are facing a dementia...Share this articleBut kind-hearted colleagues at the bank are pitching in to raise funds for the couple\u0027s living expenses by climbing Conic Hill and Ben Lomond.Ms Neilly\u0027s family in Ireland, where she is originally from, are also planning to climb Slemish Mountain near her hometown of Ballymena.Samantha added: \u0027This is a long-term illness, it\u0027s four cycles of chemotherapy and she\u0027ll have to recover afterwards.

I sleep better. I no longer get headaches. I have more money to spend on solids. I am less volatile. But I’ve discovered that a life without alcohol is simply not worth living (I’m sure I’ve become diluted from quaffing far too much San Pellegrino).There’s nothing to look forward to at the end of the day. No point sitting on a terrace with a beautiful view as, with no stem in your hand, all that’s left to do is fiddle with your phone. No reason to crave the interval during a play I tend to slope off home at half-time, the prospect of Act Two too tedious without bubbles.There’s no point winning an award or getting married or getting out of bed on Christmas morning.

I only managed to crawl down the aisle as my maid of honour and I had quaffed a magnum in my suite beforehand.And here’s the proof of the pudding (I’m eating a lot more puddings): I went on my first date without alcohol a couple of weeks ago. A man I’d once fancied more than any other in the world seen without wine goggles became boring, old and cantankerous.Drink makes us tolerant, which is why all those young women in short skirts staggering outside bars in Newcastle don’t feel the cold, or the despair of having no future (I’m not advocating becoming paralytic, just mellow).I suppose without it we make better choices – an excuse of a ‘very hungry cat’ so we can ask for the bill and go home alone – but shouldn’t the most important lifestyle choice be to be able to relax, enjoy a full stop at the end of a gruelling week? I wonder how people face the horror that is life without liquor: the rudeness of the French in St Tropez, say, or an unopened brown envelope on the mat.I have a couple of sanctimonious ‘friends’ who don’t drink, or drink very little. Even though they smoke, rarely exercise, snort coke, eat ready meals and supermarket sliced bread, still they would raise their brows as I recycled the Christmas empties. ‘Hmm, six bottles from, what, four days?’ ‘The dog knocked a glass over.’ ‘How on earth do you afford it?’ ‘I never had children.’Can you imagine: nine months of growing varicose veins and stretch marks and the prospect of no sleep for 25 years, unable to even sip something bubbly with your feet up.

It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canal    Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canal    A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles          Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack           Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalAll of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack.

The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestDashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalSatellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone  The second target was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles  The third target, Him Shinshar CW Bunker, was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles           This graphic issued by the Pentagon on Saturday illustrates how the attacks unfolded from air and sea.

Samantha Grant, who shares a father with Meghan, said she must do the \u0027morally right thing\u0027 and invite her entire family to the Windsor event on May 19 Trish Gallup, 58, said the family was \u0027saddened and hurt\u0027 by their apparent non-invitation and said she was no longer holding out any hope. She said she was unsure if Thomas Markle would be invited. She revealed she had met Princess Anne at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Royal forced to catch her when Ms Gallup got her heel stuck and fell over.   It came after Meghan\u0027s half-sister said it was in \u0027poor taste\u0027 not to invite her to her wedding to Prince Harry - despite being estranged for the past three years.Samantha Grant, who shares a father with Meghan, said she must do the \u0027morally right thing\u0027 and invite her entire family to the Windsor event on May 19.She said: \u0027Closeness has nothing to do with it, it is incumbent upon her to do the morally right thing and invite family and demonstrate she has a ­humanitarian heart\u0027.

It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesBarzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone. Smoke still lingered well after the attack that happened in the early morning darkness of 4amA Russian motion in the UN Security Council to condemn the airstrikes was rejected with only China and Bolivia joining Russia to vote in favour, as U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley promised the country was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons \u0027red line\u0027 in the future.Moscow\u0027s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: \u0027A pre-designed scenario is being implemented. Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.\u0027 Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad\u0027s chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing.             Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons           Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK\u0027s air strikes \u0027legally questionable\u0027, forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings. Today on the Andrew Marr show (pictured) he called for a \u0027war powers\u0027 lawThe Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime\u0027s chemical weapons program back \u0027years\u0027. At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.       A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles            Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack             Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 \u0027We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,\u0027 a Pentagon spokesperson said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Nick Gordon breaks down as police arrive on night of arrestScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canal  Satellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone    The second target was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles    The third target, Him Shinshar CW Bunker, was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles             This graphic issued by the Pentagon on Saturday illustrates how the attacks unfolded from air and sea.

The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed.You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before.These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond.Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points.The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now ided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords.The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way.Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn.You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality.The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway.Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.”But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters.There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky.It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour.Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time.The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place.Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape.Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good\u0026nbspstaff.Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day.Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users.It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank,\u0026nbspgiving almost no clue of their busy inner lives.Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions?For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic.Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume\u0026nbspthat the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between\u0026nbspwhat was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become\u0026nbspmore stark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/006c60975f11c5f2a7084e6330ef787cc5e0cc43/303_0_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7b8a1f39b0e6798bba2e78ca926494c4 1240w","title":"philip green defends his record on bhs","story":"Retail tycoon ‘sad’ that he doesn’t get more credit for paying into bankrupt chain’s pension fundRetail tycoon Sir Philip Green has defended his behaviour over the collapse of the BHS chain, describing his decision to sell the retailer to a serial bankrupt as “the worst mistake of my life”.The billionaire owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge said he was “sad” he had not received recognition for paying £363m into the BHS pension scheme last year, in a move that headed off the threat of him losing his knighthood. Asked in an interview with the Mail on Sunday if any of the BHS furore was his fault, he said: “No. Zero. Nothing.”Green owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015 – a year before the retailer collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green and other investors were paid £586m in idends, rent and interest during their ownership of the retailer.Referring to BHS, Green added: “We didn’t go as a vulture and bankrupt it, try to keep it all to ourselves. That was the stupidity. Trying to do it the correct way turned out to be a disaster.”Claiming that he spent £35m on the legal bill alone for dealing with the BHS collapse, he said: “My family lost millions on BHS.”Following a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse, the businessman was labelled by MPs the “unacceptable face of capitalism” and accused of the “systematic plunder” of the company, along with Chappell and their “hangers-on”. Under pressure from the Pensions Regulator, Green agreed to pay £363m into the BHS pension scheme in February 2017 to help plug its £571m black hole. He feels he deserves more credit for this.“I wrote a cheque for £363m,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “But nobody has ever said, this man behaved like a gentleman, his family behaved properly. I’m not doing this as an act for you because you know it’s not my style – but I’m sad that there’s no acceptance of that.”He added: “Fortunately, we were able to pay and rectify it. I was pleased we were able to resolve it.”Green questioned whether antisemitism played a role in the accusations. “Do I think the viciousness has anything to do with the fact that I am a Jewish businessman? Well, I’m not going to say. The answer is I don’t want to get into it.”He came under fire for cruising the Mediterranean in his wife Tina’s £100m yacht Lionheart in the summer after the BHS collapse while BHS pensioners worried about their future. His wife is also the legal owner of Green’s business empire (since 2004). The couple’s lavish lifestyle has frequently drawn criticism.Green defended his lifestyle, saying it was the result of his business successes. “I feel like I’ve got to justify I had the ability to pay, that my family has got a yacht, that I’m living a nice lifestyle. Thank goodness, along my journey, I was very successful and therefore I was able to pay.”Green also accused Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee that led the investigation into BHS, of a personal vendetta. The Pensions Regulator’s report showed he had made a number of earlier offers before a final deal was reached, but Green’s view is that Field “harassed the Pension Regulator” and that this delayed the payment, according to the Mail on Sunday.The collapse of BHS in April 2016 was one of Britain’s biggest business scandals and led to calls from MPs that Green should be stripped of his knighthood.Unlike Chappell, Green escaped a ban from serving as a company director by the Insolvency Service last month.

The turn to the right taken by politics from the mid-1970s onwards was summed up in one phrase coined by Margaret Thatcher in 1988. This idea tended to be associated with liberal economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, both of whom influenced Thatcher deeply. Both thought that left to their own devices buyers and sellers would work out the price for everything, be that a loaf of bread, a wage, or an operation in the health service.But economists and politicians who would certainly not have classified themselves as Hayekians, Friedmanites or Thatcherites also found the idea of market forces hard to resist. The new Keynesian school believed that there might be short-term impediments – or stickiness in the jargon – and that it was the job of government to deal with these market failures. But in the long term they too thought markets would return to equilibrium. All sorts of policies flowed from this core belief: from privatisation to curbs on trade unions from cuts in welfare to the attempt to create an internal market in the NHS. It also justified removing constraints on capital and the hands-off approach to financial regulation in the years leading up to the banking crisis of 2008. Anybody who suggested a gigantic bubble was being inflated was told that in free markets operated by perfectly rational economic agents this could not possibly happen.Then the financial markets froze up. This was a classic emperor’s new clothes moment, when the public realised that the economics profession did not really have the foggiest idea that the biggest financial crisis in a century had been looming. Like a doctor who had said a patient was in rude health when she was actually suffering from a life-threatening disease, it had failed when it was most needed.Just before Christmas, I wrote a column supporting the idea for some new thinking in economics. It caused quite a stir. Some economists liked it. Others hated it and rushed to their profession’s defence.My piece said there was a need for a more plural approach to economics, with the need for a challenge to the dominant neo-classical school as a result of its egregious failure in 2008. The argument was that a bit of competition would do economics good.If the latest edition of the magazine Prospect is anything to go by, a debate is now well under way. Howard Reed, an economist who has worked for two of the UK’s leading thinktanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the malaise is so serious that a “deconomics” is needed that “decontaminates the discipline, deconstructs its theoretical heart, and rebuilds from first principles”.Reed says a retooled economics would have four features. Firstly, recognition that there is no such thing as a value-free analysis of the economy. Neo-classical economics purports to be clean and pure but uses a cloak of ethical neutrality to make an an inidualistic ethos the norm.Secondly, he says too much economics is about how humans ought to behave rather than how they actually behave. Thirdly, economics needs to focus on the good life rather than on those areas most susceptible to analysis through 19th century linear mathematics. Finally, he calls for a more pluralistic approach. Economics should be learning from other disciplines rather than colonising them.Prospect gave Diane Coyle, a Cambridge University economics professor, the right to reply to Reed’s piece and she does so with relish, calling it lamentable, a caricature and an ill-informed diatribe.Most modern economics involves empirical testing, Coyle says, often using new sources of data. She rejects the idea that the profession is stuck in an ivory tower fiddling around with abstruse mathematics while ignoring the real world. Rather, it is “addressing questions of immediate importance and relevance to policymakers, citizens and businesses”.Nor is it true that the discipline requires that people be rational, calculating automatons. “It very often has people interacting with each other rather than acting as atomistic iniduals, despite Reed’s charge.” Coyle accepts that macro-economics – the big picture stuff that involves looking at the economy in the round – is in a troubled state but says this is actually only a minority field.The point that there are many economists doing interesting things in areas such as behavioural economics is a fair one, but Coyle is on shakier ground when she skates over the problems in macro-economics.It was after all, macro-economists – the people working at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England – that the public relied on to get things right a decade ago. All were blind to what was going on, and that had quite a lot to do with their “markets tend to know best” belief system.Policy makers did not find the works of Hayek and Friedman particularly useful when a second great depression was looming. Instead, they turned, if only fleetingly, to Keynes’s general theory, which told them it would not be wise to wait for market forces to do their work. Reed’s argument is not just that blind faith in neo-classical economics led to the crisis. Nor is it simply that the systemic failure of 2008 means there is a need for a root-and-branch rethink. It is also that mainstream economics has been serving the interests of the political right.Some in the profession, particularly those who see themselves as progressives, appear to have trouble with this idea. That perhaps explains why they have been so rattled by even the teeniest bit of criticism.

In the meantime we will have lost a lot of installers, who will have gone out of business – a lot of expertise. It’s not a shame – it’s shocking in this day and age, really.”The government axed its flagship energy efficiency scheme in 2015 and has yet to replace it or signal what might come next. Guijarro said the black hole on policy could lead people to conclude energy efficiency is unimportant, even though experts view it as vital for cutting bills and carbon emissions.“You have this whole radio silence, this missed opportunity where you could absolutely have that narrative around health and wellbeing, and benefits of having a warmer, healthier home. And the longer it goes on the more people think it’s not important,” Guijaro said.The comments by Citizens Advice follow the government coming under fire for downgrading targets for insulating older homes with solid walls. The University of Exeter said the move meant it would take more than 400 years to upgrade the UK’s last uninsulated solid wall homes.E.ON told the Guardian that the change could also restrict the help that vulnerable households received, and make the solid wall target more challenging to hit. The big-six energy supplier said a serious energy efficiency plan would help consumers more than a price cap, which it has vigorously opposed.“Overall, as a country we need to bring the energy efficiency of homes up to the level that is right for the 21st century, and which could save many hundreds of pounds off the annual energy bill. This is a far more sustainable policy, which politicians should consider embracing as opposed to implementing a temporary market-wide price cap,” the company said.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “We are investing £6bn into making homes more energy efficient, including schemes to provide insulation, as well as a further £320m to enable consumers and non-domestic users to participate in a trailblazing heat networks scheme.”Industry and government are mulling how to reduce the climate change impact from heating, with energy efficiency considered a “no regrets” option.The UK’s homes and businesses are overwhelmingly heated by fossil fuels, mostly gas. Energy UK, the big-six lobby group, last week urged the government to fund trials of low-CO2 alternatives, such as greener gases including hydrogen, heat pumps running off renewable electricity and local heat networks.But experts said the switch to greener heat would not be as simple as the transition to low-CO2 power, which accounted for half of UK electricity supplied last year.Mike Hemsley, senior power analyst at the government’s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said: “There’s a lot of barriers to installing efficiency and low-carbon heat.” He added that it was also not clear yet whether there was a low-CO2 option that was cheaper than today’s heating systems.The government’s experts seem to share that view. A report published on Friday by BEIS concluded there was a large degree of uncertainty over the best way to decarbonise heat, given limited information on the feasibility of the technologies, their cost and whether consumers would accept them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ec96ba6d2f37a20014902059cd40681ea3a0b0/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2c0a92cc90ca9ee9a12542e7c954fa9b 1720w","title":"trinidad homphobic laws win case commonwealth","story":"I am a gay Trinidadian. Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266cc48868797af0021a64acfbbd55339d86cc11/0_0_4370_2624/master/4370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=789e682c1eebe398e931059d3df02859 1240w","title":"poor peoples campaign systemic poverty a sin","story":"After the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our societyAccess to healthcare is just one of the issues facing the 140 million people who live in poverty in the US today. Over the past two years, the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has carried out a listening tour in dozens of states across this nation. We have met with tens of thousands of people from El Paso, Texas, to South Charleston, West Virginia, to Selma, Alabama, where we met Callie, gathering testimonies from poor people and listening to their demands for a better society. On Tuesday, we announced a Poor People’s Campaign Moral Agenda, a set of demands that is drawn from this listening tour, as well as an  audit of America we conducted with allied organizations, including the Institute for Policy Studies and the Urban Institute, 50 years after the original Poor People’s Campaign. As grim as the situation was in 1968, the appalling truth is deep inequalities still exist and, in some ways, we are worse off. In the last eight years alone, 23 states have passed voter suppression laws – gutting the Voting Rights Act civil rights leaders helped secure more than a half century ago. This is the true hacking of our democracy, allowing people to win office who deny healthcare, living wages, cut necessary social programs and push policies that promote mass incarceration, hurt immigrants and devastate our environment.These racist laws hurt not just people of color, but poor whites whose lives are upended by the politicians put in office by the violent extremism that is voter suppression. Coretta Scott King would call all of this violence. She’d say that violence isn’t just killing people with guns, but denying them living wages, allowing them to live in ghetto housing. We rightfully get in the streets and protest when the police shoot unarmed black men, but we must also stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our society. We must no longer allow attention to violence to keep the poor, people of color and other disenfranchised people down.People are poor not because they are lazy, not because they are unwilling to work hard, but because politicians have blocked living wages and healthcare and undermined union rights and wage increases. Our nation’s moral narrative is shaped by Christian nationalists whose claims run contrary to calls in the Scripture, which is very clear that we need to care for the poor, immigrants and the least among us.  If you claim to be evangelical and Christian and have nothing to say about poverty and racism, then your claim is terribly suspect. There needs to be a new moral discourse in this nation – one that says being poor is not a sin but systemic poverty is. The Moral Agenda we announced on Tuesday demands a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws, new programs to lift up the 140 million Americans living in poverty, immediate attention to ecological devastation and measures to curb militarism and the war economy. We call for major changes to address systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative, including restoration and expansion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, implementation of federal and state living wage laws, universal single-payer healthcare and clean water for all.  To make sure these demands are heard, poor and disenfranchised people from coast to coast are preparing for 40 days of action centered around statehouses and the US Capitol. Over six weeks this spring, people of all races, colors and creeds are joining together to engage in nonviolent moral fusion direct action, massive voter mobilization and power building from the bottom up.  To prepare for the 40 days, poor and disenfranchised people, clergy and advocates will participate in nonviolent direct-action trainings across the country on Saturday. Now, 50 years after leaders of the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to break the silence and tell the truth about the interlocking evils of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative. All over the country, poor people like Callie are joining together, with support from clergy and advocates. As she said on Tuesday in unveiling our demands: “We not going to keep crying. We’re going to march, we’re going to protest and we’re going to vote.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01546b9f20e8f689757ab9cefb9cd2e04da05910/0_36_4007_2404/master/4007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec7291971286b85c38b87e143f9410ff 1240w","title":"syria assad doing nothing disastrous policy missile strikes","story":"After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter catastropheLet’s cut the canting. No one thinks, not those ordering them and not those opposing them, that the missile strikes against the Assad regime will influence the outcome of the catastrophe in Syria. That pass was sold long since. If there was an opportunity for America, Britain and their allies to make a difference for the better, the chance was missed many, many deaths ago. What we are witness to – on the part of both the leaders of the western democracies and their critics – is a tableau of actors striking postures designed to make the players feel better about themselves. This posing can never rewrite the blood-drenched history of a seven-year conflict that has turned Syria into a charnel house and shredded international norms about the conduct of war.The proximate cause of this crisis is the chemical attack on Douma last weekend. After years of unmasterly inactivity by the democracies, it is that atrocity that drew attention back to what is happening in Syria and finally stirred punitive action against Bashar al-Assad. In the words of the ineffable Donald Trump, the retaliatory strikes are supposed to demonstrate to “animal Assad” that there is a “price to pay” for the dictator’s use of banned weaponry. In the more measured language of Theresa May, “we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to be normalised”. Yet the normalisation of chemical weapons is precisely what has already happened in Syria. Assad’s regime has time and again used chemical warfare to slaughter its own people, as it has also deployed hideous “conventional” weapons such as dropping barrel bombs and fuel-air bombs on civilian areas to inflict mass casualties.Over seven years of relentless savagery in Syria, the hands of the leaders of the western powers have been wedged firmly under their bottoms. They have been encouraged to maintain this impotent posture by legislators too feeble to grip the dilemmas posed by Syria and voters weary of engagement with the hard parts of the world. Listening to both their public pronouncements and their private calculations, the abiding impression is that this belated and limited action by Washington, London and Paris is not driven by any conviction that these strikes will make any meaningful difference. They won’t even stop Assad manufacturing more chemical weapons if he chooses to do so. Missiles are flying mainly to soothe guilt about repeated earlier failures to act.Even so, I give these leaders a little more credit than I can find for those whose only counsel is to do absolutely nothing. At least some of these belated interventionists are wrestling with a genuine dilemma. Action over this chemical attack, when so many previous atrocities have been given a free pass, looks like therapy by Tomahawk, a gesture, not a strategy. But to let yet another use of chemical weapons happen without any form of response would have given a complete sense of impunity to the Assad regime and its sponsors in the Kremlin. Every dictatorship on the planet has been getting the message that there is no penalty for the acquisition and use of weapons prohibited since the First World War and that has chilling implications for future conflicts.The other side of our tableau of posturers is composed of those who oppose this action as they have clamoured against all previous attempts to do something about Syria. The non-interventionists come in two categories. There are the “it’s nothing to do with us” brigade who declare that “we haven’t got a dog in the Syrian fight”. Mainly to be found on the hand-washing right, the cold brutality with which they express their indifference to so much human suffering has the sole merit of being candid.Less honest, not least with themselves, are the self-proclaimed peace-lovers. Mainly to be found on the hand-wringing left, they are too busy looking in the mirror admiring their own halos to face the moral challenges posed by a situation like Syria. Jeremy Corbyn opposes this weekend’s action on the grounds that it “risks escalating further” what is “an already devastating conflict”. The Labour leader and those who share his worldview are consistent. Do nothing has been their unvaried policy for the past seven years of carnage. There is no doubt that they can expect support from a lot of a domestic electorate turned allergic to engaging with abroad, especially the Middle East.As the non-interventionists have preached inaction, the death toll in Syria has been remorselessly – what’s the word, Jeremy? – escalated by the Assad regime and its allies. Whenever pressed to say what they would do, the non-interventionists fall back on calling for “negotiations” and more effort at the United Nations. They have to be aware that Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to shield Assad from any effective action by the UN, most recently by blocking an independent investigation into the chemical attack on Douma. While the non-interventionists have talked about talking, the Assad regime and its backers in the Kremlin and Iran have been free to go on killing.Some argue that the fatal turning point was the summer of 2013 when Assad’s use of chemical weaponry defied a “red line” drawn by Barack Obama, who then failed to enforce it. That has become the main reference point of the British argument because it was then that David Cameron failed to secure parliamentary approval for participation in punitive air strikes. When MPs turned him down, the then prime minister abandoned any further effort with a huffy “I get that”. The people who really “got it” were the Syrian civilians who continued to die in their thousands.It is possible that intervention at that point might have made some difference. In truth, the west made its gravest decision not to act earlier when Assad responded with vicious suppression to the original uprising against his dictatorship in 2011. Rather than offer succour to the secular democrats who rebelled against the regime, the west stood by as he imprisoned, tortured, executed and crushed those who cried out for freedom. Every force in Syria was provided with resources and weapons except for the liberal opposition. Humanitarian initiatives could have been attempted, such as creating safe havens for civilians and imposing no-fly zones to impede Assad’s ability to slaughter his own people. They weren’t even tried. No meaningful pressure was applied to bring him to the negotiating table. The opposition become dominated by jihadists. Regional powers and Russia moved into the voids left by western inaction.It is not provable whether earlier intervention would have altered the course of Syria’s tragic history. Non-interventionists said then, as they say now, that anything that the west does only makes things worse. That we can’t prove either. What we can see is how bad things have become and it is hard to conceive how exactly it could be worse. After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter disaster in every respect.The United Nations struggles to put an exact figure on how many people have died, but best estimates put the number at around half a million. More than 5 million Syrians are refugees abroad and more than 6 million have been internally displaced. Assad has flattened cities and smashed through nearly every international taboo about the conduct of war. The Syrian dictator is massacring his way to victory and there is no one who thinks that this weekend’s missile strikes will in any way impede him. The conflict has inexorably widened and now consumes the region as Syria has been turned into a battlefield for proxy conflicts between regional players. Russia has been encouraged in its belligerence. The west looks helpless. Dictators the world over have been emboldened to believe that they can crush opposition using the most barbaric methods and the rest of the world will do nothing to stop them. Those striving for freedom have been commensurately disheartened. The rule of international law has been weakened.Action has consequences and they are not always the ones intended and hoped for. That was the grisly lesson of Iraq. Inaction also has consequences. Doing nothing can have a price every bit as high. I’d think better of the non-interventionists if they’d ever once admit that. Inaction has been a terrible choice in Syria.Interventionists have been rightly obliged to own all that went horribly wrong in Iraq. Non-interventionists, the horrors of Syria are on you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4267691e2f8d6badfb18d7e8380bc11a023236a3/393_0_2130_1279/master/2130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a79422a8942bd92dd5745e39deaf5f51 1240w","title":"2001 a space odyssey film haunts dream space","story":"Astronomers last week announced official names for the principal mountains and valleys of one of the solar system’s remotest objects, the tiny world of Charon. More than 3.6bn miles distant from the Sun, the moon – which orbits the dwarf planet, Pluto – was first observed closely in 2015 when the US probe New Horizons swept over its freezing, airless surface.Now the features revealed by the robot craft have been given titles by the International Astronomical Union. And key among the explorers and scientists honoured are the film director Stanley Kubrick and the writer Arthur C Clarke.As a result Kubrick Mons and Clarke Montes are now two of Charon’s major mountains. It is a fitting honour – and timely. The two men’s great collaborative work, the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, was released 50 years ago this month. By putting its creators’ names on the map of Charon, at the edge of the solar system, astronomers are repaying a debt to two visionaries who reshaped our thinking about the cosmos and created a film rated by some as the greatest ever made.Other celebrations of the film’s release include a recreation of the set of the film’s strange bedroom finale, which has just opened at Washington DC’s Air and Space Museum. In addition, the film-maker and writer Michael Benson’s book Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece, is published this week. Benson describes the movie “as an art film made with a Hollywood blockbuster budget that is more comparable to a musical composition than to the usual dialogue-based commercial cinema”.At the time, Kubrick had intended merely to make a science-fiction film that seemed credible. Clunky scripts, cardboard sets and crude cinematography marred most such films. So Kubrick turned to the British writer Clarke and the two worked on a script that slowly swelled in scope and ambition. Eventually they produced a story that covered the origins and destiny of the human species – a journey from ape to angel, as Kubrick put it.According to their story, simple cavemen would encounter intelligent aliens who would help them acquire brainpower and so set humanity on the path to the planets. Once space travel had been achieved, humanity would make further contact with these aliens, who would then help us – after we had survived the murderous attentions of a supercomputer – to turn ourselves into a species with superhuman powers.And this is what Kubrick eventually produced, although significant scenes were altered and dialogue written and rewritten throughout filming at MGM’s British studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Massive sets were constructed and props built and rejected. (The giant monoliths that appear in the film were clear Perspex initially, but were junked for the jet-black\u0026nbspvariety.)The end result is striking. No words are spoken during the film’s first 25 minutes, and of its total 142 minutes’ running time only 40 contain speech. Its finale is enigmatic to the point of inscrutability. Audiences were baffled and more than 200 people, about a sixth of the audience, walked out before the end of the film’s premiere, says Benson. MGM was convinced it had backed “an epic disaster”. Even Clarke was disappointed by the film’s lack of concession to audience understanding, he later recalled.Leading US film critics lined up to rubbish the movie: “trash masquerading as art,” claimed Pauline Kael in Harper’s. Fortunately for MGM, Kubrick and Clarke, this critical misfire was shortlived. The counterculture 1960s were then in full swing and young filmgoers were attracted by word of mouth (and ultimately the film poster’s tag line) suggesting that this was the “ultimate trip” movie. John Lennon even claimed at the time that he was going to see 2001 every week, while David Bowie produced his own musical tribute, Space Oddity, within a year. “Something was happening and older audiences did not necessarily know what it was,” says\u0026nbspBenson.Equally intrigued were young scientists desperate to witness technology that was credible and imaginative, something that had been entirely absent from feature films until then. “The film set new standards for ‘realistic’ portrayal of life in space, overcoming decades of Flash Gordon space-westerns,” says a former teenage astronomer, Professor Ian Christie of Birkbeck, University of London. “It also created a new soundtrack for cosmic spectacle – through the use of the opening of Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra and the music of Ligeti.”Similarly, astronomer Carl Murray, of Queen Mary, University of London, says the film was the first one that made him really think. He later became a member of the imaging team for the Cassini probe sent to Saturn in 2007. “We didn’t see any monoliths, but we all knew we owed a lot to Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick for inspiring our\u0026nbspimaginations.”In the end, 2001: A Space Odyssey became the highest-grossing film of 1968 – the only Kubrick picture ever to achieve such a standing. It also won Kubrick his only Oscar: for best visual effects (although they were actually the work of Douglas\u0026nbspTrumbull).The film also stimulated a generation of young cinema enthusiasts who have since dominated film-making. James Cameron, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan have all acknowledged 2001 as a key influence on their output. “Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science-fiction movie. It is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I’m concerned,” says Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise.This view is maintained by the current generation of younger directors, such as Gareth Edwards, director of Rogue One, one of the more recent Star Wars films. “It is a movie blockbuster while also being as artistic and abstract as you can get. No one would bankroll a film like this again. It is a phenomenon of its time,” Edwards told the Observer.The film is not without its flaws, of course. In the early “Dawn of Man” sequences, Moonwatcher the apeman is inspired – by an alien monolith – to pick up a bone to use as a weapon, thus triggering an intellectual evolution that ends 4 million years later in modern humans and their propensity for war. The idea that violence underpins the human intellect is based on the ideas of anthropologist Raymond Dart, which were popularised in the 1960s by the writer Richard Ardrey, but which have since been discredited.“They don’t reflect current thinking,” says palaeontologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. “Bones may have been used as tools, but for digging for roots and insects – not as clubs. That said, 2001 is still one of my favourite films – dazzling and mystifying in equal measure.”There is another intriguing aspect about the timing of the film’s release. In 1968 humanity then seemed set for the stars. Only a few months after the film’s release, Apollo astronauts had reached the Moon and with a year had landed on it. The rest of the solar system would soon be conquered, it seemed. Space flight would become common. The film’s eponymous dateline therefore seemed prescient. However, the Vietnam war and other budgetary constraints ended that dream, though Clarke, who died in 2008, always remained\u0026nbspoptimistic about the prospects of further\u0026nbspexploration.In an interview at the end of the last century, he was asked what went wrong with his prediction. “Nothing very much, “ he replied. “America and Russia didn’t bother building more powerful, reusable launchers – they had other things on their minds – and that has made space too expensive for widespread use. Someone soon is going to get round that problem, however, and when that happens all the space stations and moonbases we envisaged will come about. I am very confident of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bdf50a06821306324e36323e1f0599b0352c95/0_160_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e140f8135d14de5efa4ee8ff5d4f8004 1240w","title":"newcastle united arsenal premier league match report","story":"As Rafael Benítez strode on to the pitch and earned a richly deserved standing ovation, yet another Arsenal inquest was about to begin.At the end of an afternoon when, courtesy of a fourth straight win, Benítez’s Newcastle United emphatically banished any lingering relegation fears and the debate about Jonjo Shelvey’s England candidature was re-opened, Arsène Wenger once again reached for his metaphorical tin helmet.They may be looking forward to a Europe League semi-final against Atlético Madrid but this was Arsenal’s fifth straight Premier League away defeat and they have still to collect a single point on the domestic road during 2018.In mitigation, their Europa League quarter-final triumph at CSKA Moscow on Thursday night was followed by a 5am landing at Luton airport the following morning. That rude awakening left Wenger’s players fatigued and his team in need of the sort of refreshment which facilitated a Premier League debut for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder Joe Willock.Not that Arsenal initially seemed either overly tired or missing the absent Mesut Özil – given the day off here. Instead Alexandre Lacazette volleyed them into an early lead at the end of a wonderfully fluent attacking move also featuring Shkodran Mustafi’s 60-yard pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s adhesive control and intelligent square ball.It was Aubameyang’s second visit to the north-east, the first having come six years ago when he played Olympic football for Gabon at St James’ Park. In 2012 Aubameyang and friends limbered up with a friendly at nearby Northern League Heaton Stannington where he caused quite a stir by arriving in a pair of £2,500 Swarovski crystal-encrusted trainers.Ayoze Pérez – who cost Newcastle a relatively modest £1.5m when he joined from Tenerife – is unlikely to ever command the £56m that Arsenal paid Borussia Dortmund for Aubameyang but, almost imperceptibly, the young Spaniard has grown into what initially seemed an unnatural No 10 role in Benítez’s hallmark 4-2-3-1 formation.So much so that Pérez has now scored three times in the last three games, with the latest pulling Newcastle right back into things here. In some respects the equaliser was almost a carbon copy of Lacazette’s opener. It, too, began with a fine long delivery – this time over 50 yards from Jonjo Shelvey. Once Dwight Gayle had brought Shelvey’s pass under seamless control and Mustafi negligently stood off, the striker fed DeAndre Yedlin whose superb low cross from the right was met by Pérez’s right foot before arrowing beyond Petr Cech.Martin Dubravka’s arrival on loan from Sparta Prague in January has been a key factor behind Newcastle’s recent renaissance – significantly Lacazette’s goal was the first the Slovakia goalkeeper had conceded at St James’ Park – but, bar a momentary brain freeze on Willock’s part he would surely have been beaten again just before half time.When Mo Diame slipped, Lacazette was gifted possession and the striker’s pass seemed to have cued the teenager up for a memorable goal. Poor Willock perhaps overwhelmed by the moment he got his feet in an awful tangle and a glorious chance evaporated.By then it had turned into an intriguing tactical duel between Arsenal’s slick possession game – featuring the odd encouragingly mature cameo from Willock before his replacement by Danny Welbeck – and the counter-attacking strategy which has enabled Benítez to over-achieve this season.The vastly improved Jamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett have been influential, while Shelvey’s defence-splititng contribution alongside the quietly influential Diame has frequently changed games. Against Arsenal he did much to suggest that Gareth Southgate is wrong to continue turning a blind eye to his England candidacy. It is unlikely that the unusually subdued Mohamed Elneny would relish facing Shelvey and Diame every week.Indeed, Arsenal were not enjoying a second half which saw Islam Slimani, on for Gayle, create Newcastle’s second goal. It began with Slimani heading across for the area, leaving Pérez to contribute a clever dummy and neat flick and Matt Ritchie to lift his shot over Cech. Nacho Monreal will not relish watching the replays.Creating havoc, Slimani subsequently emphasised his impact by creating another opening which resulted in Kenedy hitting the bar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2157621c91238e9940f437cf86d75a48d7d17698/0_450_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2846ab7037044d2cfe0750112c9fee5c 1240w","title":"womens fa cup semi finals arsenal everton chelsea manchester city","story":"• Forward scores twice as Chelsea see off Manchester City• Arsenal’s Louise Quinn’s injury-time header seals 2-1 victoryA goal in each half from the in-form England striker Fran Kirby booked Chelsea a place in the FA Cup final at the expense of Manchester City.Chelsea took full advantage of any weary England legs in the City starting XI as Kirby fired them in front inside five minutes.With two league meetings unable to separate the sides this season, this FA Cup semi-final match up promised the first chance to see these side go head to head and be forced to fight for a win.Eight Manchester City players featured over England’s two World Cup qualifiers against Wales then Bosnia and Herzegovina, compared to Chelsea’s two. And with Kriby sitting out the trip to Sarajevo to protect a niggle the Londoners clearly benefited from rested legs.England and City captain Steph Houghton was at fault she mistimed a headed clearance to let in Kirby who slotted past 18-year-old Ellie Roebuck.Going a goal behind failed to rattle City who dominated possession for the rest of the half but were unable to break through a resilient Chelsea back line.While wave after wave of City attack arrived, Nadia Nadim was closed out by Millie Bright and Maren Mjelde and looked isolated in the middle. City’s brightest outlet looked to be Nikita Parris down the left, but bar a shot from distance and a through balled poked straight at Hedvig Lindahl there was little direct threat on the Chelsea goal.Chelsea squad depth was tested. Missing Ji So-yun, who is in Jordan with South Korea for the Asia Cup, and Ramona Bachmann to a late injury, they showed no signs of being fazed by the rearranged starting eleven.Both sides have shown signs of fatigue though. A heavy fixture schedule – both are in the semi-finals of the Champions League – has seen their league form take a hit. City having lost two and drawn one (against Chelsea) since they last won a WSL match, against Liverpool on 11 February. While Chelsea have three draws in a row since they last picked up three points - away to Yeovil on 21 February.Chelsea started the second half much more brightly and the game started to open up. Drew Spence forced a save from Roebuck who spilled the ball before falling on it under pressure.A lengthy stoppage as Maria Thorisdottir was treated for an ankle injury before being stretchered off, showed no signs of slowing play as City began to knock on the Chelsea door, Georgia Stanway forcing a fingertip save from Lindahl.But pushing forward left them exposed, and again Kirby was there to pounce and score her 22nd goal of the season. Capitalising on another City mistake, Kirby pick the ball up just inside the halfway line, drove towards the City area, before cutting inside and slotting a cool finish past Roebuck in the 74th minute.A standing ovation greeted the striker as she made way for Aluko shortly after, rested, no doubt, for Chelsea’s midweek trip to Everton and then Sunday’s visit of Wolfsburg who have twice knocked the Londoners out of the Champions League.City, meanwhile, who started the season with hopes of multiple silverware, now look like they could finish the season empty-handed.

For the past two years, Wolves have explicitly worked towards promotion and the end product on the pitch is a team decorated with a handful of luxuries, one that will prove a welcome addition to the top flight. However, moans and groans concerning their relationship with the super-agent Jorge Mendes have not only become tiresome but linger like a bad smell. For Wolves, it is only the tangible scent of the Premier League that matters.Fosun International, the Chinese conglomerate that assumed control of the club in July 2016 has been criticised for bankrolling promotion, with Wolves thrust under the magnifying glass with regards to their recruitment, particularly their relationship with Mendes – whose Gestifute agency is part-owned by a Fosun subsidiary – the first of his portfolio of clients being the club’s manager, Nuno Espírito Santo. The Leeds United owner, Andrea Radrizzani, publicly questioned the link, while on Friday Premier League clubs reportedly raised the issue at their quarterly shareholders meeting. Supporters, however, have seen the funny side and at Villa Park in March, masks bearing Mendes’s face were confiscated at the away turnstiles.It is true Mendes’s clients, namely Rúben Neves, a £15.8m signing and Diogo Jota, the Atlético Madrid loanee who joins permanently this summer for another eight-figure sum, have scattered stardust but Espírito Santo has also found a way to amalgamate the jigsaw pieces. Wolves’ seemingly rapid progress has not been the 60-second makeover sometimes painted. Both Walter Zenga and Paul Lambert failed to deliver such harmony and, while Wolves have undoubtedly continued to strengthen, Espírito Santo must take credit. The Portuguese is a diligent man-manager, a grounded character, nonplussed by personal accolades and equally reluctant to indulge in hyperbole. Every now and then, his passion spills over, as in Cardiff on 6 April. After all, Wolves are not the only team to throw money at it both Middlesbrough and Derby County have spent millions in search of promotion, yet one or perhaps both will miss out this time around.“The manager is extremely good at making sure we are focused come game-day,” John Ruddy, the Wolves goalkeeper, says. “He is very set in the way he wants us to do things, it is always about us. It is not about us adapting to another team and I think that is reassuring as players. We know how we want to play we know what we are good at doing.“It’s all right spending the money but if you’re not bringing in the right personalities and mentalities then it doesn’t matter. If they are not working in unison then you are never going to succeed. We have got a great group. There was a lot of change in the summer and the lads that have come in, including myself, have adapted to a really good dressing room. That is testament to the lads that were already here and the manager as well.”The supremely elegant Neves oozes class and has stimulated the midfield, orbiting the centre circle, arcing passes as he goes and, on six occasions this season, coming up with the truly spectacular, as at Molineux against Derby on Wednesday evening. Like Jota, there are exclusive options to buy four more loanees, including the striker Léo Bonatini and defender Willy Boly. The latter has impressed as part of Espírito Santo’s preferred three-man defence – a system he has stuck to – alongside the captain Conor Coady and Ryan Bennett. Coady, a fixture in midfield and then a deputising right-back in his first seasons in the Black Country has excelled in the sweeper role, tidying up and wiping the floor with countless Championship forwards. In fact, it’s the money not spent which highlights Wolves’ perfect Pick’n’Mix. They could have signed 210 Matt Doherty’s for the price of Neves, given the £75,000 fee for the former. The right-wing-back has flourished in Espírito Santo’s system and, on the left, Barry Douglas, a £1m assist-king from Konyaspor has become a priceless commodity. That backbone has provided Wolves with the platform to play.As much as Wolves’ squad is talented, from August they face a different test. This season, a wobble has comprised four games without a win – the rest has been business as usual. Unsurprisingly, they have scored the most goals in the ision, from all areas, yet increasing firepower seems sensible, even if Benik Afobe makes his loan move permanent, as expected. Espírito Santo has been happy quietly to blood youngsters too, including Bright Enobakhare and Morgan Gibbs-White, who joined the club aged eight.It may have been meant figuratively but when Jeff Shi, the club’s executive chairman, said Wolves were building not a house but rather a manor last month, it was a reflection of the hierarchy’s lofty ambitions – a peek into the future – as well a nod to how far they have come. It is a contrast to the club that went stale at the tail end of Steve Morgan’s reign. Tens of millions in investment has translated into a 10-year plan, with European football mooted as a realistic target. But, just by reaching the Premier League, pride has been restored in a club that was not so long ago floundering, and tumbling into League One. The Wolves crest is glistening in the spotlight once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/636d84d48d4ddda56c20ed90e6e930035bcc6ada/0_122_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=922bda5b307267b65a9e7adfdb0b64d4 1240w","title":"manchester united v west brom premier league live","story":"78 min “I’ve seen both McLean \u0026amp Lingard shout Foxtrot Oscar directly into the referee’s face today within any punishment,” says Niall Mullen. “I can only imagine what Buffon said to Michael Oliver.” 77 min Nyom is finally booked for a hack at Martial.77 min West Brom make a chance, with Matt Phillips replaced by Grzegorz Krychowiak.76 min If it stays like this, Manchester City will be champions, and United will have completed a bizarre week in which they won away to the champions and lost at home to the bottom team. 75 min Marcus Rashford replaces Ashley Young. Don’t ask me what formation United are now playing.75 min Sanchez picks out Martial, who mishits a shot over the bar from 15 yards.Hahaha, West Brom have scored! Brunt’s deep corner from the right was headed back across the face of goal by the under pressure Matic, and Rodriguez arrived late to plant a stooping header past De Gea.72 min The lively Rodriguez leads a three-on-three break and finds Phillips, who wins a corner. It would, let’s be honest, be pretty hilarious if West Brom won this game.71 min A draw today would not mathematically give City the title, though they would be 15 points and 30 goals clear with five games to play.70 min West Brom are camped in their own half now. Mata plays an inviting square pass to Lingard, who slashes a shot just wide from inside the D. Lingard wanted a corner, and replays show that it did indeed deflect off Brunt.68 min “I found United more fun to watch when they had an attack consisting of several talented and likable youngsters like Martial, Lukaku and Rashford,” says Phil Podolsky. “The arrival of an ageing big-name mercenary in Sanchez made them less fun to watch for this neutral. I’m sure Jose will be fascinated with this tactical analysis.”66 min: Great save from Foster! That’s more like it! Matic swings in a cross from deep on the left towards Lukaku, who bullies Gibbs and thumps a downward header towards goal from ten yards. Foster plunges to his right and just tips it away at full stretch.65 min “I’m obviously no fan of United, but I accept they have a weird public persona this season,” says Matt Dony. “If someone were to base their knowledge purely upon thinkpieces, they would assume that Liverpool and Tottenham are comfortably above United in the league. It’s hard to love Jose’s style of football, but I’ve always loved him as a manager and a presence in the league (Although, I would HATE to have him at Liverpool). One thing that’s been noticeable this year is, they’ve rediscovered the ability to come back. Ferguson’s United hardly ever looked beaten you always, always expected them to mount a come-back. Without being exciting, or even particularly consistent, they’ve had some of that steeliness this year. I respect them. Grudgingly. Bitterly. Annoyingly.”64 min Martial has looked lively since coming on, and Sanchez is still scurrying around relentlessly. 63 min “Bored,” says David Flynn. “The most likely scorer in this game is Harry Kane.”62 min It’s now pouring down at Old Trafford, the heavens weeping at the memory of a Giggs-Scholes-Keane-Beckham midfield. 61 min “Hey Rob,” says JR in Illinois. “I’m finding this game very similar to that 5-5 game five years ago with the exception of the ten goals.” 60 min Martial runs at Nyom, who shoves him over with all the subtlety of a ramraider. The free-kick leads to a corner which leads to sweet, sweet nothing. 59 min “Generally, if you say it’s two good goalkeepers playing well, it would give the impression of a freeflowing open game,” says Adam Roberts. “This fixture disproves that theory. I’d write more but the lethargy induced by watching this has overwhelmed me.”Embrace the lethargy. I’m so bored that I’m starting to get a kind of Valium high.58 min A United change: Anthony Martial replaces Paul Pogba, who was poor.55 min Pogba, already booked, shoves McClean over just outside the box. It wasn’t enough for a second yellow card but he needs to be careful. The free-kick is a long way to the left of centre, and Brunt ks it into the wall.53 min Mata whistles a 20-yard shot well wide.52 min Imagine following that City comeback with this. 51 min “My United supporting friend also says that this team should get more respect,” says Niall Mullen. “I think they do get respect but not a lot of love (like most Mourinho teams they are not that lovable). The respect is mitigated by the fact that they’ve essentially failed to trouble the scorers in the two big competitions despite spending a lot of dough \u0026amp hiring a blue-chip manager. Also United fans asking for their team to get more respect is indicative of the post Fergie slide. I’m used to a bulletproof United swagger that doesn’t really give a fig what people think of them. That seems to have disappeared.”49 min Lukaku isolates Gibbs, beats him with his 12th stepover and hits a low cross that deflects into the warm bosom of Foster.49 min De Gea makes another comfortable save from a Rondon header.47 min Lingard almost scores straight away with a shot that is crucially blocked in the kamikaze style by Dawson.46 min United begin the second half. Lingard has, in fact, replaced Ander Herrera.Manchester United have made a half-time change, with Jesse Lingard coming on to replace all 10 outfield players.“If this game carries on in the same vein,” says Ryan, “this MBM could be up there with Jacob Steinberg’s fabled MBM of the FA Cup 5th round replay between Fulham and Sheffield United in 2014. Sometimes when I’m feeling down, I find that page in my bookmarks and remember that at least I’m not being forced by my employer to watch that terrible match. There’s certainly a place beside it for another one, and you just might be in the process of suffering for this art.”“Watching Leicester in the 70s, there would sometimes be a quick break,” begins Adam Roberts. “It would reach Jon Sammels on half way and he would put his foot on the ball, look around, slow the game, let the defence organise itself and lose all momentum. Paul Pogba’s playing that role today.”He’s got the keys to the kingdom but hasn’t got time to use them because he’s having too much fun on his smartphone. “You said earlier that this United side deserves more respect isn’t this sort of game exactly the reason they don’t get it?” says Nick Parish. “I expect they’ll win comfortably 2-0 in the end, having survived a few scares along the way, but compare how City, Liverpool, Spurs or any of Fergie’s great United sides would have put this West Brom team to the sword. That’s how you earn respect.”Yep, fair point. I still think UnitedMourinho deserve more respect for the fact they are above Liverpool and Spurs, but they didn’t half test my remaining generosity of spirit in the first 45 minutes.Let us never speak of that half again.45+1 min Pogba links up well with Sanchez and whacks a shot that deflects off Hegazi and over the bar. United have their first corner!44 min Can you die of boredom?42 min West Brom win the first corner of the match - and almost score from it. Brunt swings the ball beyond the far post to Dawson, who heads it dangerously into the six-yard box. There’s nobody there for West Brom and Smalling hooks it clear.41 min “At LEGOLAND Windsor getting wet,” says Ian Sargeant. “At least I’m not watching this match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a8685038a66cfbe80ad0346e7d7a358bf82f14/237_329_1853_1111/master/1853.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ace805f15d7e00d85bb566af2f67e5c3 1240w","title":"newcastle united v arsenal premier league live","story":"Matt Ritchie scored in the second half to give Newcastle, who are now safe, a 2-1 win over an Arsenal side that may yet face a struggle for sixthThere we go then. Newcastle have won four in a row – a brilliant run for them and one that currently looks like nailing them a top-half place. Relegation is no longer a concern. Arsenal may have other priorities but Burnley, in seventh, are only two points behind them and they won’t want to take their eye off the ball too any more times. They might consider a draw would have been fair here but didn’t really turn up creatively in the second half and were punished. Newcastle, high in tempo and thrust, punished them.That’s all from me – join Rob Smyth for Manchester United v West Brom!A roar goes up! That’s a huge win for Newcastle – they are definitely, incontrovertibly safe!90+2 min: Slimani gets a booking, I think for timewasting. Nobody really minds. Kenedy bashes a Monreal cross away and a Welbeck blast is blocked. Then Joselu wins a free-kick on halfway and that may more or less be that ...90+1 min: We have three minutes of added time to play ...90 min: Newcastle are close now and their stadium is thumping with nervous energy. Arsenal are undercooking a few of their passes and don’t really look crisp enough for a breakthrough. That getting-the-ball-to-the-strikers issue has actually been a thing in this half.88 min: It’s all Arsenal probing now, trying to pick a way through, but Newcastle look solid on the whole.86 min: Murphy replaces Ritchie for Newcastle, while young striker Nketiah is on for Iwobi.85 min: That’s a half-sight for Arsenal, Iwobi denied very well by a sliding defender ... before Dubravka flaps at a high ball and Lacazette, recovering quickly, smacks wide when Welbeck is screaming for it.83 min: They do win a corner though, which Xhaka outswings from the left. It’s low, miscued and deeply disappointing – just like Elneny’s subsequent 35-yard pot shot, which was never on at all.82 min: Maitland-Niles wins a fun chase down the left with Slimani. Arsenal are, in general, pushing Newcastle back a bit now though – without really threatening.79 min: Maitland-Niles replaces Chambers for Arsenal, while Newcastle bring Joselu on for Perez.77 min: Another Newcastle chance! Slimani, brilliant since he came on, powers down the left, beats Mustafi and lays off to Perez, who doesn’t quite get control of the ball at an angle and eventually slides to put it wide of the near post.77 min: Dubravka is out confidently to claim a Xhaka corner. No real response from Arsenal yet.75 min: ... Kenedy hits the bar! He’s sprung clear again by a neat interplay with Slimani and his effort, deflected by a lunging defender, loops up onto the frame and away. That could have been that!74 min: Kenedy breaks down the left and for a moment looks as if he might tee up Perez in the middle, but he shows too much of the ball to Holding, and then ...72 min: What have Arsenal got now, I wonder. Their away form has been so insipid for most of the season. Not that they’ve been bad today, especially given the changes – I must admit the goal from Ritchie came out of the blue. But they don’t really want to give Burnley, in seventh, too much encouragement by losing here. If they lost to Atletico *and* lost sixth ...That came from nowhere! Slimani leaps to win one header, then launches himself to power into another, and Perez leaves the ball astutely to give Ritchie space inside the area. He finishes confidently with his weaker right foot and Newcastle are ahead!68 min: Willock, tidy on his top-flight bow, is replaced by that guy Welbeck.67 min: Decent dig from Iwobi, who can’t find Lacazette with his first attempt but gets the ball straight back and smashes low from 20 yards. It doesn’t go far wide of Dubravka’s near post.65 min: Good early touches from Slimani, the second seeing him blocked by Mustafi. He’s had injury issues since joining from Leicester but is now fit and should give them some interesting presence in the last 25. Ritchie blasts over from range during these musings.63 min: A change for Newcastle now, with Gayle – who has worked very hard and did well for the goal – replaced by Slimani.61 min: “One of the ways that Benítez has out-tacticked Wenger is to shove people up against Elneny, who’s been hemmed in and has had nothing like the influence he’s had over his last couple of games,” notes Charles Antaki. “It’s true that Willock has been no help, but as the commentators keep telling us, he’s only 13.”A late Ritchie challenge on Monreal temporarily raises the volume, meanwhile.58 min: Maybe this game needs Welbz. Excellent goal from him on Thursday, in fairness. I was sitting yards from it and he looked so strong in the move leading up to it. The finish, too, was superb.56 min: Those Perez spurts aside there really isn’t a lot going on, though Aubameyang heads a deep Chambers delivery across goal only for a black \u0026amp white shirt to stop it reaching Lacazette.53 min: Perez spurns another decent position after another fine Shelvey pass from range, allowing Mustafi to beat him in a winnable one-on-one.51 min: An excellent Diame interception sends Perez scurrying away into some gaping space in the Arsenal half, but he never really gets his head up despite men dashing up to support and Xhaka gets back to dispossess him before any trouble can unfold.50 min: Scrappy stuff at the moment, Arsenal snatching at a few things in their own half but Newcastle not putting a lot together when they get the ball.47 min: It’s mainly Arsenal possession early on, a Monreal cross eventually being defended before Iwobi is penalised for handball.Another goal or two in this one, I reckon.“If Jonjo Shelvey can cause this many problems with through balls to Dwight Gayle, imagine what he could do playing with Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford. Are we really going to pass up that option for the sake of Henderson, Dier and Livermore?” asks Shaun Wilkinson.It’s an interesting question. Is there sometimes too much focus on what Shelvey *doesn’t* do?That is indeed the half and it’s been enjoyable. We’ve seen very nice goals from Lacazette and Perez, both the results of excellent passes from 60 yards or so back, and a flurry of other activity on top. Arsenal should probably have put away one of the chances they created in the five minutes before half-time, but it’s a good scrap and we’ll see much more of it in 15 minutes. Back shortly!45 min: Nearing half-time now. It’s been a fun half, better than I’d expected to be honest.42 min: And that should definitely be 2-1! Elneny forces an error from Diame and now Lacazette has a run towards the area with men either side. He could even have a crack at goal himself but instead passes left to Willock, who misses his shot completely. Elneny, coming up on the other side, was in an even better position to score.41 min: Now Chambers gets a free header from a Xhaka corner, and might do better than head over once he meets it.39 min: ... which should lead to a second goal. Aubameyang puts the free-kick into the wall but Xhaka picks the ball back up and chips it to the far post where ... I think ... Mustafi is stationed to head across. He does so and Chambers, running in from an almost identical position to Lacazette earlier, slices well wide!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7b8d44ab52adf755a83c54fcb2dab822b5d81e8/50_871_1864_1118/master/1864.jpg?w=1750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf24d3f26623ca5dd498d9397f94dcd 3500w","title":"who would like to live under the sea","story":"Plenty of people, according to Phil Nuytten, the man who has designed and plans to build a city beneath the wavesPhil Nuytten first decided he wanted to spend his life underwater when he was six years old. It was 1947. The Second World War had only recently ended. Nuytten’s dad had scored a job at Boeing, and the firm’s office in Vancouver Harbour was just a short walk away from the family home. Every now and then Nuytten would waltz down to the harbour unaccompanied, sneak out to the end of the docks, peer through the cracks and fall hopelessly in love with what he saw: fish, anemones, a teeming underworld. “I used to think: ‘Gosh, wouldn’t it be wonderful to go down there?’” he says. “To go down to that particular place?”Nuytten and I are sitting in his office, a wood-clad two-storey workshop on an industrial section of the North Vancouver shoreline not far from where he grew up. He is in his 70s now, scrupulously groomed and graciously quick-witted, with an old-time mariner’s flair for storytelling. He is also believed to be one of the world’s leading deep-ocean explorers. During a six-decade career he has pioneered ing techniques that are now industry standard, designed underwater machinery that has become a staple of several navies, and recorded world-first es.He has studied oil fields, surveyed dams, toured submarine construction sites and explored sunken wrecks. His firm, Nuytco Research, boasts a client list that includes the BBC, Greenpeace and film director James Cameron – Nuytten provided ideas and apparatus for The Abyss and Titanic and the pair remain friends. Nuytten also develops equipment for Nasa and, because the seabed is in some ways analogous to the surface of Mars, trains astronauts. Nuytten never went to college. He is almost entirely self-taught, yet the impact he’s had on ocean exploration has been vast.Now Nuytten is about to embark on a project likely to become his showpiece: a vast underwater colony, decades in development, that will provide humanity with an escape hatch should things go to pot above ground. Work will begin on a prototype later this year. A larger colony will follow soon after. So long as everything goes to plan, hundreds and then thousands of people will begin to migrate to the sea floor, to play out their lives at the bottom of the ocean in much the same way they would have done above ground. Before long, many more will follow.Whether or not everything will go to plan is difficult to judge. “It’s a harsh environment,” James McFarlane of International Submarine Engineering tells me. “You’ve got salt water, corrosion… And when you get into the water things start to get expensive fairly rapidly.” Still, Nuytten is determined. He has given his entire life to developing methods that allow humans to spend inhuman amounts of time underwater, often at unimaginable depths. Now he’s in the final throes of a mission to move us all down there – and once we’re there, he doesn’t think we’ll ever want to come back up. “I have this wonderful picture in my mind,” he says. “A little kid is sitting on his dad’s knee, just as I used to do, and he points to the ceiling of this habitat and says: ‘Dad, is it true people used to live up there?’”The idea the human race might one day live at the bottom of the ocean is not new – underwater habitats have been popping up in shallow waters since the early 1960s. In 1962 a French duo, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, spent a week inside a minuscule habitat designed in part by the French explorer Jacques Cousteau. It sat 33ft below the surface on the sea floor close to Marseille and looked like a watery space station. The following year Cousteau convinced a five-person team to live for a month beneath the Red Sea, off the coast of Sudan. Two years later he developed a third base, Conshelf III, which he anchored more than 300ft below the surface off the coast near Nice. A six-person team lived there for three weeks. Every day they left the base to work on a mock-up oil rig. It was hoped inhabitants would perform similar work in the future, by which point the rig would be real.Before long, additional habitats materialised off the coasts of Bermuda, California and Germany. Bases were funded by governments, wealthy patrons or the petrochemical industry, and there was huge academic optimism. Here was an opportunity for scientists better to study the ocean’s inky depths, aquanauts to study human anatomy, energy companies to discover alternate resource streams and ers to launch record-breaking descents.“In the 60s everybody in the ocean business firmly believed there would be cities under the sea in fairly short order,” Nuytten says. “Never happened.”By the end of the decade the race to colonise the bottom of the ocean slowed to a trot, then all but petered out. The habitats were expensive to build and even more expensive to run. The lack of natural light could send tenants loopy. And, because the bases were built at ambient pressure, decompression periods were long and risky. Teams would spend weeks at a base, conduct tests, learn more about the limits of human endurance, slowly resurface to land and, in many cases, never return. One by one the habitats were abandoned. Research institutions erted funds elsewhere. Government agencies shifted their attention skyward. Space replaced the Earth’s oceans as our final frontier.At the time Nuytten was still a rookie in the ocean industry. He had begun to work on the concepts for which he would later be lauded, but Cousteau’s experiments, which to many seemed more like science fiction than reality, never strayed far from his mind. The subject became a kind of obsession. What if he could create a habitat that was cheaper to build and cheaper to run? What if he could find a way to reproduce the natural light man needs to exist comfortably? What if he could overcome problems caused by the deep ocean’s almighty pressure? And what if he could do what Cousteau and his contemporaries could not: convince society it would be a good idea to live 3,000ft under the sea?In his office, Nuytten tells me he works best when big questions like these loom overhead. “I run around looking for needs so I can fill them in. I like to have about 10 things on the go at once.” Nuytten is a perennial tinkerer, most effective when there are problems to solve, and the barriers to successful underwater living posed interesting problems.By the end of the 60s he had begun work on his own colony, which he began to refer to as Vent Base Alpha. Every now and then he’d scribble ideas on paper scraps and file them away, gradually accumulating hypotheses. Whenever he developed a new piece of technology, usually for a client, he’d experiment with how it might be incorporated within plans for the base. Sometimes a sketch would lead to a breakthrough, and he’d be able to understand what went wrong the first time someone tried to live under-water. What followed was half a century of successes and setbacks. Now a working vision has emerged.Here’s how Nuytten plans to build the colony. First, he’ll forage for equipment in what he calls “the boneyard”, a huge lot in which he stores discarded apparatus. (“I never throw anything away. I am a hoarder.”) He’ll locate a stack of abandoned saturation tanks and convert them into living quarters, laboratories, a series of floodable airlocks and a hangar for submersibles, each tank impeccably welded to the next. Later, he’ll equip the structure with a Stirling engine capable of producing the electricity required to create artificial sunlight, allow inhabitants to grow crops and, crucially, enable them to “crack water into hydrogen and oxygen”. Nuytten relays this last piece of information urgently. “There’s your life support,” he says.The colony will be transported to open water, most likely the Juan de Fuca Strait, a 154km-long outlet to the Pacific Ocean south of Vancouver Island. It will be submerged and hauled to the sea bed a few thousand feet below, and then it will be installed next to a hydrothermal vent – a kind of underwater geyser. The vent will give the colony its name, its hot emissions will power the Sterling engine and its mineral-rich deposits will be mined. Inhabitants will trade the bounty – laboratory-pure cobalt, in the case of the Juan de Fuca Strait – with buyers above the surface. Nuytten will make no financial gain from the project. Funding will come from government agencies, though Nuytten will forgo requesting official permission over whether or not a huge heap of metal can be attached to the ocean floor, preferring instead to “beg for forgiveness” after the installation – his customary strategy. (The prototype, in contrast, will be sanctioned by an offshoot of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, a government body, and anchored in the Burrard Inlet, not far from Nuytten’s office.)When the colony is complete, Nuytten will be among the first to take the plunge. His wife Mary, to whom he has been married for more than 60 years, will follow. As will his daughter, Virginia, if only for a visit. “I’m a mad-keen gardener,” she tells me over the phone. “If I couldn’t have my plants with me, I wouldn’t want to be there.” Soon enough, the family will be joined by other members of the ocean community: scientists, engineers, oceanographers, as well as James Cameron, who has already reserved a berth. Within a few weeks the base’s early tenants – a dozen or so people – will have settled into a routine.At least in the beginning, inhabitants will live underwater for months at a time, though they will be able to come and go. The atmosphere within the colony will tally with that on the surface, eradicating the requirement for decompression and making travel between the two worlds “like taking an elevator down to the parking garage”, explains Nuytten. But, soon enough, we will live at 3,000ft below as though it were normal. The colony will expand. More and more people will slip below the surface to begin second lives, and new colonies will appear around the world. Our routines won’t change, just the environments in which we perform them. We will do the things we normally do: commute to work, gossip with friends, spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. There will be underwater hospitals, banks, galleries, offices, parks, gyms, cinemas, farms, maybe even a forest or two. Children will be born in the colony. Eventually they will die there, too.But all of that will come down the line. First, Nuytten says: “We’ll have to figure out what we want to do down there.” He stops, then adds: “None of this has been done.”During our conversation Nuytten shows me an artist’s impression of the base. It’s an image of a structure that looks much like an underwater power station – a great mass of welded metal, similar to that of a rig. To the right of the picture a hydrothermal vent spouts sooty emissions and ers mine the ocean floor for minerals. Inside, inhabitants resembling Star Trek characters tend to operations. The surrounding environment looks dark and eery, a permanent night. You’d have a hard time working out what time of day the image depicts.I ask Nuytten why we would ever need to live underwater. “We need a second place to go,” he says. “There’s less and less space on Earth, and fewer and fewer resources. And here’s a whole ocean filled with them.” Nuytten is a fierce conservationist. “The oceans are the lungs of this planet. If they go, the planet goes.” In his grand vision, the colony is a kind of salvage operation. It will enable humanity to alleviate the burden it has placed on land. “We’ve demonstrated there will come a time when the planet as we know it will not be able to support the population. The population keeps growing and growing, and with climate change and natural disasters on land getting to be excessive… As far as we know, those same things aren’t happening under the sea. That’s one of the things we want to study: what are the effects of climate change on the deep ocean? We know what the effect is on the shallow regions, the coral reefs, but what about 3,000ft down? What’s happening there?”But how easy will it be to convince other people to take the plunge? “They’d batter the doors down,” he said. “Literally. I’ve given a lot of talks on this, and I’ve had all kinds of people, from wackos to really serious people, saying: ‘If you do this, we want to go.’”This seems like a hopeful response. Nuytten has spent much of his life below the surface. To him, the ocean is home. But what about the rest of us? What about the isolation? What about not being able to go anywhere any time we wanted? Won’t we miss the sun?Nuytten tells the story of an advertisement he’d heard had once been placed in a local UK newspaper. It read, “Wanted: people to go to Antarctica. Poor pay. No guarantee of success. Doing things no one has done before.” “They were inundated with applications,” Nuytten recalls. “I expect that to be the case with this. There are so many people, particularly young people, who are desperately trying to figure out what to do, what they can do that nobody else has done, things that are difficult, things that will protect our oceans.” The first inhabitants will be pioneers, Nuytten believes. “Once you have the first group down there, staying a few months, the next batch will show up.”Nuytten is in no doubt the colony will succeed. “There were an awful lot of people who said we’d never fly in the air,” he tells me. “And even more who said we’d never go to the moon.” But his comment is underpinned by a more urgent message, one that moved the conversation away from personal success and into the realms of societal requirement. “What are we going to do if something catastrophic happens to where we live?” he says, resignedly. “We have to have some place to go.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73741041641331fb56d9e5df72936455b02ce842/0_22_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e1b54868d1e3ed72d266eb9484cb88e 1240w","title":"happy lane why i love living in bristol","story":"Abandoning his habitual mickey-taking, Nikesh Shukla examines his home town’s glories, from seagulls to street partiesDo you even like living in Bristol?” a friend asks me. “Reading your column every week, it would seem…’ She stops mid-sentence. I get what she’s saying. Whenever people ask me whether I enjoy living here, I do that classic British thing, best exemplified by how we follow football – I trash it because I love it. I take the piss out of it and I keep it in its place through mockery and misery, because that beats admitting how much I love it. The city and I have a complicated relationship, what can I say? Here is a non-exhaustive list of things I love about the place, you know… for balance:1. I live near a long road called Happy Lane. It looks positively post-apocalyptic. Every time I cycle down it, I feel happy mostly because of the mismatch. Not because of the community graffiti that tries to hide the sad brickwork.2. On getting off the bus, people shout, “Cheers, drive!” to the driver as they go past. Obviously it’s polite to thank the driver for the journey, even if they rolled their eyes at your fiver and you got stuck in traffic, making you 20 minutes late for a meeting. Obviously you thank them. But “Cheers, drive”? Come on. It’s adorable.3. During the particularly cold weather we’ve had recently, a bunch of people bought up loads of woolly hats, gloves and scarves, and left them around the city, with a label saying: “I’m not lost. If you need me to keep warm, take me.” Bristol has an innate thoughtfulness.4. At the Watershed cinema, filmgoers are encouraged to write down reviews on index cards and pin them on a board. One person, without fail, declares every single film: “NOT AS GOOD AS JURASSIC PARK.”5. I was once walking across a bridge, eating an ice cream. A seagull, on an attack mission, dove into my ice cream and managed to abscond with everything but the cone. I stood there for a second, stunned, staring at an empty cone. I noticed a man, dressed as a pirate to attract tourists, staring at me. Our eyes locked. He burst into laughter. “Ere mate, get yourself another,” he said, offering me a pound coin. I smiled at his small act of kindness and bought myself another ice cream. I ate it in the safety of the shop this time.6. Bristol is the street-party capital of Europe, apparently.7. Most places will be guaranteed to have at least one night dedicated to mid-90s hip-hop, and the ageing b-boy in me is comforted by never being too far away from a night that will drop Large Professor remixes of Nas tunes.8. Everywhere in the main hub of the city is within walking distance.9. Rice \u0026amp Things, a Caribbean restaurant in Stokes Croft, lights a barbecue at 7am on Fridays to make jerk chicken. Even in the snow. The smell is amazing.10. When my daughter was a month old, I used to walk around the city to get her to sleep. It was the height of summer, and she only fell into a deep sleep in a sling. So I strapped her to me and we walked the entire city. We walked to the mosque in Totterdown, to the mandir in St George, all around the university campus, along the harbourside to look at the SS Great Britain as the sun went down and to a comedy gig in Bedminster to see a set by a friend. We even met Neneh Cherry. The baby slept and I walked. I got to know the city well. I started to fall in love with it.There are problems in Bristol, too, of course. The legacy of slavery isn’t properly acknowledged. The terrible public transport gives people less ownership of the city. The lack of affordable housing is a huge issue. These all feel like big things compared to the lighter vignettes I’ve listed. But these moments make me feel this place is home. And knowing there are big problems here... Well, I’m like that pub football pundit analysing, deconstructing and proselytising about the team he adores and criticises so freely. I’m that guy.

The publicly owned broadcaster is also webcasting the event to invitees across the UK who cannot attend in person. Channel 4 will distribute a 15-page brochure outlining what it is looking for and the timeline for submissions with final decisions on the “winning” locations due in the third quarter.The initiative, called 4 All in the UK, will be the biggest structural change in the broadcaster’s 35-year history: it will open three new “creative hubs” in the nations and regions, with the largest to be a new national HQ that will have facilities including a TV studio and host executive and board meetings. The plans include 300 of its 800 staff moving out of the capital – currently only 30 staff are based outside London, 25 sales people in Manchester and five employees in Glasgow. Channel 4 News will open three new news bureaux, with a trebling of news jobs in the nations and regions by 2020, while spend on shows made by TV production companies based outside London will rise from £169m annually to about £350m a year by 2023.More than a dozen cities and regions across the UK – including Birmingham and Manchester, Brighton, Bristol, Nottingham, Sheffield and Hull – have expressed an interest in hosting a new Channel 4 headquarters and benefiting from the broadcaster’s largesse.The lobbying has already been intense, with Andy Street, the John Lewis managing director turned west Midlands mayor, describing his region as the “frontrunner”.Channel 4 will have to tread carefully to make sure any enticements and inducements offered by bidders to try to win the pitch process do not break state aid rules.Government rules say that state aid is “any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union”.“Like any company, Channel 4 will have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory obligation in this process,” said a spokeswoman for the broadcaster. “We have robust processes in place for all our third-party business arrangements, which will also apply as we progress the selection of our new locations.”Birmingham was quickest out of the blocks with plans in place to offer two prime HQ locations, including a site near the city centre’s proposed high-speed rail station. The sites were in part identified by the local enterprise partnership, which at the time was chaired by Street. The UK’s second largest city is already benefiting from the BBC boosting its presence. This year, BBC3 is moving half of its operation there, including responsibility for a third of its £30m budget. It is also the home of a new youth team for BBC News and the base for the corporation’s partnership with local newspapers.An early favourite, the city has gone very quiet on the lobbying front since former culture secretary Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, wrote directly to former culture secretary Karen Bradley as part of an “ambitious bid”. He said Greater Manchester was “the only viable alternative outside of London”.MediaCity in Salford already hosts a BBC base of about 2,700 transplanted from London housing sport, CBeebies, Radio 5 Live, Breakfast and Learning, as well as programmes such as Mastermind and Dragons’ DenITV also has a significant operation, including 750 staff working on productions including Coronation Street. Sky has 32 employees of its Sky Media sales operation based in the city, as does Channel 4.Sky has a major technology centre in Leeds, called Sky@LeedsDock, employing 650 staff working on apps and websites primarily to enhance customer service. Online sports business Perform has about 100 staff based in the city. Leeds is also home to Sky-owned True North, one of the biggest regional TV production companies in the UK, which makes shows including A New Life in the Sun.Channel 4 would be in good media company in Bristol, which is home to the BBC’s Natural History Unit, Wallace \u0026amp Gromit maker Aardman Animations and a raft of other production companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f065a6f84b59a30f4fc83754298aa916c477ecd1/0_116_2392_1435/master/2392.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=df6adfb31e94dc2022997d7687acee16 1240w","title":"martin sorrells departure from wpp marks the end of an era","story":"Thanks to the internet, the company he forged may not survive him, but what of the industry?For more than three decades Sir Martin Sorrell dedicated his life to transforming a small Kent-based manufacturer of shopping baskets, Wire and Plastic Products, into the world’s biggest marketing services group.The question now for his successor, WPP’s investors and its tens of thousands of clients is whether the £15bn group can survive the departure of its founder and the dramatic changes the internet is bringing to the traditional world of advertising.Sorrell’s unique relationship with WPP allowed him to run it autocratically with an iron hand – leading to a “Sorrellcentricity” that critics say had made it his personal fiefdom. These are methods his successor cannot hope to be allowed to employ.Whoever takes over could find keeping such a sprawling empire together an almost an impossible task: WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries. The era of advertising Sorrell ushered in has been about scale as a handful of big players – WPP, France’s Publicis and Havas, Japan’s Dentsu and New York-based Interpublic and Omnicom – have hoovered up smaller agencies. Sorrell, a former investment banker who cut his teeth in advertising as the Saatchi brothers first finance chief, was a master deal maker at the fore of the global land grab.“Martin changed an industry inventing a lot of what became the model for the big holding company along the way,” says David Jones, the former global chief executive of Havas. “He was renowned for his financial acumen, but his PR skills were probably even stronger. He wasn’t widely liked but he was universally admired.”But his departure, analysts say, raises doubts over WPP’s ability to withstand the core challenge facing the advertising behemoths: the internet. The rise of social media and Google and Facebook’s (hitherto unquestioned) advertising power has raised valid questions among advertisers. Big spenders like Marmite producer Unilever, Gillette maker Procter \u0026amp Gamble and car giants like Ford are increasingly questioning who they spend their money with and whether big groups like WPP still offer the best model to create and buy their campaigns for them. If big is not necessarily better, is this not only the end of Sorrell but of the lumbering advertising group? “Sorrell was relentlessly driven and competitive even at an age when most people had long since hung up their boots,” says Jones. “In the end technology caught up with him. It’s the end of an era but also maybe the beginning of the end for an industry.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/babf93aea2991fbbb0219863bd542fa6171ed6df/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3cb2f54e01c7b3c339c9338fd4272789 1240w","title":"why the politicians must set their sights on facebook","story":"The issues to tackle are political persuasion, influence and money. It may be a long waitIn a tumultuous week in US politics, seven hours of testimony in Congressional committees about the data and privacy practices of a social platform nevertheless held the interest of the press and public almost to the exclusion of all else.Mark Zuckerberg – 106.9 million Facebook followers – is a person of intense interest not only to the US legislative process, but to a wider population whose lives he touches in some way every day through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Over two days and through more than 600 questions, the Facebook founder ran the gamut of politicians’ outrage and curiosity. If the hearing proved one thing, it was that the activities tech firms are now involved in puts them out of the reach of legislative comprehension, and immediate action.The hearings were down to Facebook’s apparent lack of due diligence with the private data of tens of millions of people being used without authorisation by the marketing company Cambridge Analytica. The micro-targeting firm – partly owned by the rightwing billionaire Robert Mercer and used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 election – uses psychometric data to persuade people to vote or buy things in certain ways (though the company says the unauthorised Facebook data was not used in its work for Trump). The covert nature of persuasion on the social web means that effective marketing is no longer something you can see or even perceive, but rather something which through a thousand “touch points” might subtly change your behaviour without you noticing.The data protection of tens of millions of Americans is at the heart of the issue, but how it was used drew only fleeting attention. The politicians questioning Zuckerberg were in an unusual position. Never before had Congress had to call to account a business on which so many of their own communications strategies and campaigns rely. Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina who asked Zuckerberg the tougher questions about its monopolistic behaviour, was very clear that he thinks the days of self-regulation are over for Facebook.“I expect the regulatory regime for a company like Facebook will be challenging and difficult. The regulatory tools available to us today may or may not work with Facebook. It could possibly take the creation of new laws and regulations to deal with this platform. But I do believe this. Continued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook,” the Senator - 167,000 followers - wrote on his own Facebook page.“I am concerned about how much Facebook values transparency,” the Californian senator Kamala Harris - 972,262 followers - wrote on her Facebook page after her more effective questioning. Billy Long, the Republican from Missouri - 5,923 followers - was so pleased with his question about “Facemash”, Zuckerberg’s embarrassing “hot or not” site he first created in his dorm room at Harvard, that he posted a news item about it to his very modest band of followers. The $11m (£7.7m) in lobbying that Facebook spent on Capitol Hill last year went almost entirely into targeting legislation rather than paying lawmakers directly, but its influence in US domestic politics goes far beyond issues of psychometric targeting. One of the most dramatic moments of the two-day hearing was a line of questioning opened by the Democrat congressman John Sarbanes about the “embeds” from Facebook who worked with political campaigns. The advertising purchased on and through Facebook is often protected by contractual clauses with advertisers, putting the public in the bizarre position of not being able to actually see what publicity is being targeted at them. When last week Facebook removed related accounts and posted a few samples of the advertising that the Internet Research Agency puts on the network, they showed that “ads” often mean what we might think of as posts that have been paid to reach a wider audience. And the advertising expenditure only tells part of the story.A tactic deployed by partisan groups involves setting up apparently innocuous or independent “news media property” – in other words a Facebook page that publishes news – ahead of key campaigns or election issues, which gather likes and follows from constituents who thereby expose their interest in, or thinking on certain subjects. These are the kind of shell news operations which substitute for the local news organisations that are rapidly closing down in rural and urban America. For these tactics to be effective, Facebook data doesn’t have to be misused, but the public is nevertheless being misled.Outside the US the kind of social media asymmetry that congressman Sarbanes was scratching at has far more dramatic consequences. The most serious and well-covered of these has been the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, and the repression of Rohingya Muslims. Facebook has a disproportionate share of attention across all media, official pages have huge followings and independent journalists can struggle to be verified. Ahead of his grilling on Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg wrote to human activist groups in the country who are outraged by the company’s negligence. It was mentioned by only a small number of politicians in the hearings, but the dynamics of Facebook in small unstable markets around the world is of overwhelming significance.If the threads of regulation that Congress started to very gently pull on lead anywhere, it must be to more than just the protection of US user data, important though that is, and it must go beyond the concept of political persuasion and advertising into the broader areas of influence, power and money. This would mean perhaps as much self-examination as it does questioning Zuckerberg. For that to happen we might be waiting for quite some time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c3786602f47b57004d9085fc9644ec02a87738/462_773_6898_4139/master/6898.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8438f1ce7c15725644d003c72cd23078 2600w","title":"dua lipa pop has to be fun you cant get upset about every little thing new rules","story":"There are plenty of reasons to be startled by the young musician Dua Lipa. Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands.Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’”Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.”We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass.It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent\u0026nbspbox.“You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.”As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”).“Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.”“Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.”Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us\u0026nbspalready.And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story.Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.”In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.”Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to\u0026nbspschool.”Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.”We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello.Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.”From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look\u0026nbsplike.Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’”How did you feel?“I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.”And when you got there?“It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.”There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference.Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.”You weren’t telling yourself that at 14…OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14…Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud.As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos.Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight.She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage\u0026nbspand two very different\u0026nbspspeeches.The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that\u0026nbspstage.”Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreamsmagic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff?Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.”She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms.“For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.”Dua Lipa is on tour now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/390c7b1a691c50490f975dcc0a42feff6d06f310/0_0_3608_2164/master/3608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=787af488231dd2f257d77c469b588905 1240w","title":"mark knopfler skips dire straits rock hall of fame induction","story":"British rockers Dire Straits have been inducted into the rock’n’roll hall of fame, but the occasion was marked without its lead singer and guitarist Mark Knopfler, who chose not to turn up to the ceremony.Knopfler skipped the concert in Cleveland, US, on Saturday, and it was left to bassist John Illsley to explain his absence.“I’ll assure you it’s a personal thing,” Illsley said onstage. “Let’s just leave it at that.”In an earlier interview with Billboard, Illsey said of Knopfler: “He just didn’t feel like coming, it’s as simple as that. It just didn’t appeal to him, and I appealed to him on several occasions.”On Saturday, Illsley acknowledged the awkwardness of Knopfler not being present and then took a subtle swipe at his close friend by saying, “it’s more than one person, a collective”. The band did not perform after speaking.Illsley did compliment Knopfler for writing music that made the band – who had a string of hits in 1970s and 80s, including Sultans Of Swing and Money For Nothing – “stand out from the crowd”.Former Bon Jovi members Richie Sambora and Alec John Such joined current members, including Jon Bon Jovi, onstage to mark the band’s induction into the prestigious club. They performed crowd favourites Livin’ on a Prayer, You Give Love a Bad Name and It’s My Life.The 33rd annual Rock Hall ceremony kicked off with a tribute to Tom Petty, who died in October at age 66.

The notices – requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period – were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica’s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.Banks – who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing £8.4m in donations and loans – confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received “information notices”. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were “responding to it’” He said the ICO’s action was not an “investigation” but “an information request”.In a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for £41,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for “analysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development”, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum.Banks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after “new information had come to light”. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica.Banks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it “did some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.”Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU’s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around £40,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news.He also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month.Ukip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica “saw” the data but a spokesman admitted the information – including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things – was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as “preparatory work”.The spokesman said: “I asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn’t like it and he’d refused to pay for it. It’s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.”The revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to iniduals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of £42,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU’s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission’s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense.The unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner’s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU’s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO’s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain’s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was “ridiculous” that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica’s computer servers and equipment.Separately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work. A spokesman said: “Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data. And Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica whether in relation to the EU referendum or otherwise.”The ICO may be asking questions because of previous comments Banks has made, including in an interview a year ago with the Observer. When asked about the use of Leave.EU’s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?”In an email on Friday he said: “Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.” He added: “Make any mistakes relating to the business and we will be most assuredly coming after the Guardian \u0026amp you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d52fd783fc7208c12065a125216ff7f27c10c2/0_413_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e798d2e166ba73118a22f5b70eb32f23 2600w","title":"wandsworth council labour targets thatcher favourite tory control four decades","story":"Activists say they have real chance of taking control of council that has been Tory for four decadesHalf a mile from where Sadiq Khan grew up on the Henry Prince estate in Wandsworth, a small gaggle of Labour activists are gathering in Earlsfield, with the real prospect of taking back a council that has been Conservative since the London mayor was at primary school.Wandsworth, famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite borough, has been a flagship Tory council for 40 years, pioneering the outsourcing of local services and famous for its ultra-low council tax.Labour campaigners have been buoyed by June 2016’s general election result, in which Labour ousted the Tory minister Jane Ellison in Battersea and slashed the majority of the then-cabinet minister Justine Greening in Putney. Housing is on the mind of many voters, said the MP for Tooting, Rosena Allin-Khan, out with the canvassers in Earlsfield where the ward is held by two Tory councillors and one Labour.“Housing is something that affects everyone, regardless of age or socioeconomic status, in council homes, renting or worrying about whether your children can ever afford to buy in the same area,” she said.One emblem is the controversial development of the former Battersea power station. Labour has said it would review the planning applications from developers in order to force them to reinstate plans for more affordable flats, controversially slashed last year with Wandsworth council’s approval.Simon Hogg, the Labour leader on the council, said the sight of the development was causing feelings of resentment. “People can see a big tower block going up and yet know none of their friends, or their children, are going to get to live there,” he said.The housing crisis had created some of the conditions for a possible Labour victory, Hogg said. “Wandsworth Tories aggressively sold off thousands of council homes to create this very large private rented sector, believing that would be a huge electoral advantage to them,” he said. “These are the renters who elected Marsha de Cordova in Battersea and gave Rosena such a big majority in Tooting.”However, it is the Tories’ low council tax pledge that is the key appeal to most voters. It still remains the second cheapest in the country at £716.51 a year for a band D property and estate agents use it to advertise their listings.Jo Rigby, who is standing in Earlsfield, admitted the low council tax message “does work, especially when people move into the area ... but what we are increasingly hearing is that, we would rather pay more and get better services”.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you.

One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Labour has said it would freeze council tax for the next two years. But John Locker, a newly elected Tory councillor who won his Thamesfield seat in a November byelection, said voters were sceptical. “I don’t think we understand how Labour can square that circle of extra spending now but not taxing more,” he said. “I want to improve Wandsworth, but in order to do that we have to manage our residents’ council tax money.”Locker’s victory was a boost for the Conservatives. He won his Putney seat at a low point for the Tories, after a difficult party conference for Theresa May, resignations of cabinet ministers and a tough Brexit negotiation, and amid a blitz of Labour activism.“Angela Rayner, Chris Williamson and lots of other Labour MPs came, there were hundreds of Momentum activists, but it didn’t work for them and we held the seat quite comfortably,” he said. Labour holds 19 seats and looks like it will make comfortable headway into the mid-20s, but the maths looks more difficult to get a majority. It would mean taking some of the most affluent wards in the country, where Labour councillors have not been elected since the 1960s.The former Tory MP Richard Tracey, latterly Wandsworth’s London assembly member, said incumbency was a key strength. “Statistically, Labour is strong in five wards, they have a lot of votes in a small number of wards. They will have to fight very hard in wards they don’t hold – it’s a high hill to climb.”Locker said Labour may have talked itself into a corner. “I do think the pressure is on Labour given how they have talked up Wandsworth as a crown jewel, winning this iconic council. I personally would never take voters of Wandsworth for granted. We have a strong manifesto on keeping council tax low, affordable housing, keeping weekly bin collections, things that really matter to local people.”Allin-Khan said in those seats where Labour needed steep numbers to win, the most crucial final hurdle would be getting Labour voters to the polls. “We’ll be piggy-backing people to the polling stations at 9.59pm.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11a438df90db330832f2c35c0617a7e9fd71a71/0_549_8348_5009/master/8348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=310650b99a3816ddf7f1ff9d7aa4357f 1240w","title":"janet mock id never seen a young trans woman who was thriving in the world i was looking for that","story":"The 35-year-old activist and bestselling author tells her remarkable story – and explains why she’s working on a new drama about trans women of colour that will be nothing like TransparentJanet Mock is talking so fast I can’t keep up. One moment we are in Hawaii and she is living, desperately uncomfortably, as a little boy called Charles. The next she is 10 years old and has created the alter ego Keisha to enable her to talk to boys on the phone. Then she is living happily as a transgender girl, a star pupil and captain of the school volleyball team. Now she is 16, doing sex work and stripping at a local club to earn enough money to pay for her operation – or bottom surgery, as she calls it.It is an astonishing story – and we have barely started. There is her move to New York at 21, a master’s in journalism, two bestselling memoirs, a groundbreaking drama she co-scripted and two marriages – and, along the way, she has become the world’s most prominent trans activist. Phew!Mock used to call herself the great pretender. When she left Hawaii to go to New York, she decided to keep her past to herself. “I had to pretend, or withhold parts of myself. Specifically my trans-ness. I had to pretend I was any other 21-year-old. Most of them had not transitioned or had to work the streets or in a strip club, and most of them were not already married. So much had happened by the time I was 21 that I just wanted to be normal and regular, whatever I thought that was.” She finally takes a breath. “Right?”Blimey, I say, do you always speak so quickly? She laughs and apologises. “Oh, I’m so sorry. I’ll slow down. Yes, I do talk fast when I’m excited. And I’m excited because this is a new space in my career.”Her sentences are regularly punctuated with the word “space”, perhaps not surprisingly for somebody who has had to fight so hard to claim hers.Mock is fastidiously polite. At times, she sounds like an old-fashioned southern belle dreamed up by Tennessee Williams. In fact, she grew up impoverished in Honolulu. Her father, Charlie, is African-American and was a drug addict (she had no idea and was devastated to discover when she was young that neighbours knew him as “Charlie the crackhead”). Her mother, Elizabeth, is Hawaiian. The family was broken and dysfunctional, but loving in its own chaotic way. As a seven-year-old, Mock went to live with her father in Oakwood, California. Her father called young Charles a sissy. Mock says she was called all sorts when she was growing up – freak, faggot, tranny, the N-word.She did not see her mother for five years until, at the age of 12, she returned to Honolulu, where she flourished. Her mother never discouraged her from becoming Janet (a name she chose after a friend told her she looked like Janet Jackson). “There were bigger issues in our family. My mom didn’t have the luxury of time and resources to micromanage any of her children’s lives.” It was a blessing, she says – wealthier parents might have paid for therapy to “right” her.Mock was helped by the fact that gender is relatively fluid in Hawaii. The word “māhū” denotes a third gender. It is a pejorative for gay men and drag queens, but it can also have a sense of the sacred attached to it.“My mom, growing up in Hawaii, saw trans people existing every day. She didn’t know they were trans. She was just like: ‘Oh, that’s such-and-such who lives on the street.’ It was the norm to have people who were not male or female people who may be in the middle somewhere.”Mock, now 35, splits her time between Los Angeles and New York. We meet for lunch at a stately hotel in West Hollywood. Mock is gorgeous – tall, curvy, with brown, almond-shaped eyes, a perfect smile and cheek-bones so high you could hoist a flag on them. Despite her sing-song voice, she is fierce and forensic in her arguments.She orders a super-strong cold brew (coffee brewed for hours in cold water) and a steak dish and we return to her past. At 15, she began hormone treatment without telling her mother. Soon after, she started selling sex and stripping to pay for her $7,000 (£5,700) surgery. The only thing she regrets, she says, is doing a\u0026nbspporn shoot to earn the final $1,500. “The sex work was private, but this was on record for the rest of my life.” In her first memoir, Redefining Realness, she wrote that she was “immortalising the one part of my\u0026nbspbody that brought me so much\u0026nbspanguish”.I ask when she started thinking of herself as Janet and she says it is a false premise she always thought of herself as a girl who was cursed by biology. She knew she wanted sex-reassignment surgery, but that was not going to determine her gender. “I believed I was, and knew myself as, a young woman, even when I had a penis. It wasn’t as if I needed the surgery to confirm that for me.”Was there any point at which she felt she could be complete without surgery? “I did not, but that’s just my experience. I know a lot of people who do, and that’s where the burden of representation comes in. I’m sitting here telling my specific story, but though I wasn’t comfortable with that, there are thousands of people who are, or thousands who don’t have access to the funds to have surgery.”Mock often talks about the burden of representation. She might be regarded as a spokeswoman for trans women, but she does not pretend her experience is representative. For one thing, she was fortunate enough to be able to choose whether to disclose she was trans. Many trans women do not have that privilege – their appearance gives them away.She has said that without her smile and her MA in journalism, nobody would have listened to her. “The ‘pretty privilege’ can give you access to spaces, just like your able body gives you access. But it makes impossible beauty standards for many other trans girls who are struggling with that right now.”She argues that trans women obsess too much about being able to “pass”, but she knows it is easy for her to say. She, too, obsessed about that in the past – ironically, one of the things she found validating was one of the things she most despised: men objectifying her.She drains her cool brew, and our main course arrives – steak, brown rice, vegetables. “Oh, my God! This looks really good.” She examines one of the vegetables curiously, and calls over Wayne, the waiter.“Wayne, is this like a sweet potato?”She has a way of engaging with people and dismissing them with self-assured charm.Mock says so much has changed in the trans world since she was young. She hopes few people today need to go to the lengths she did to fund surgery. Would she swap her story for a more sober version? “No. I would have my story,” she says instantly. Is there any time she would have swapped it ? “When I was living it yeah. Che-che-che-che!” She laughs loudly and uninhibitedly, as if clearing her throat. “I wanted a genie to pop up and grant me three wishes – to get all this over with, to have a financial safety net and to be comfortable. But I wouldn’t take anything from my experience because it built my resolve my core.\u0026nbspI fought for every single thing I\u0026nbsphave now.”Actually, Mock says, there was a great support network among sex workers. “The girls felt safe there. We took care of each other. You showed up, you knew who was there and how long she’s gone. We weren’t doing it in isolation. Now sex work had gone online so you’re by yourself all the time.”When she left Hawaii for New York, three years after surgery, Mock chose not to reveal that she was trans. She embarked on a new life experience, described in her second memoir Surpassing Certainty. “If I had disclosed, it would have made people judge me, made them not want to be with me, made me an object, a freak show. I would have been the trans girl in the room. To reveal to a class of strangers the heaviness of my past was just too much. It’s inconvenient. The inconvenient truth! And I didn’t want to be inconvenienced. It would get in the way. I just wanted to go to school to get a job, and move on.”She felt both freed and imprisoned. “The secrecy was hard to cope with,” she says. Mock also became aware of her blackness in a way she had never been before. In Hawaii, she was primarily identified as trans and “everybody was at least brown or tinted in some way”. At New York University, she was one of a handful of black students. “So, in Zora Neale Hurston’s words, I was thrust against a white backdrop.” She pauses. “I love Zora. She is THE\u0026nbspQueen!”Her progress in the publishing world was seamless. Before long, she was an editor and writer at People magazine. But she became bored. She realised she had a better story to tell than the celebrities she was interviewing. And she wanted to own that story. In 2009, she met photographer Aaron Tredwell, who was to become her second husband. “I started telling the people in my life and I was like: ‘Oh, this story is interesting because I’ve never seen it before. This is pre-Orange Is the New Black, pre-Caitlyn Jenner.’ And I was like: ‘I think I should tell my story.’ I’d never seen a young trans woman who was living and thriving in the world, and I was looking for that.”Throughout the Obama years, she says, transgender rights improved considerably in the US, but now Donald Trump is determined to reverse that progress. Last July, he attempted to introduce a blanket ban on transgender people joining the military.“There is a lot of rowing back on protections that the Obama administration put through: the guidelines for trans children in schools trans-specific affordable healthcare the military ban.” She says it is part of a wider general clampdown on rights for minorities.Trans women have been questioned from more than one side of the political spectrum. What does Mock make of the continuing opposition from some feminists?“I think it is rooted in the same thing they say they’re fighting against – biological essentialism. So, it’s saying that if you don’t have these specific biological experiences as a woman you cannot be a woman, you cannot be in our struggle. I would argue that for women to say the only identifying factor of a woman is a pussy is misogynistic. If we’re saying that to be a feminist is to eliminate barriers and alleviate marginalisation based on gender, then how could you not want to include the persecuted trans women\u0026nbspor non-binary folk so you have more comrades to fight against gendered oppression?”She looks me in the face. “My grandmother gets who I am, so when you ask me about people who don’t understand, or people who are on their bully pulpits saying you shouldn’t accept people, I’m like: “What’s happened to you that, of all the things you can talk about, of all the injustices in the world, the one thing you want to concentrate on is trans people living their truth? How is that harming you and your identity? How I identify has nothing to do with you, and how you identify has nothing to do with me. Right? So live your life and let me live mine.”She chews on her steak, decisively. I hope that is not directed at me, I say, cowering. She stops in her tracks and bursts out laughing. “Che-che-che-che. Nonononoo.”Mock has spent much of the past year as part of the writingproducing team on Pose, the new trans drama devised by Glee creator Ryan Murphy. She is also directing one episode. I ask her what she thinks of Transparent, the US comedy-drama about a middle-aged father who becomes a trans woman.“I don’t watch it, so I don’t know,” she says.But it is one of the few dramas featuring trans characters, I insist.“It was never really for me. Just because there’s a trans character doesn’t mean it’s a show I would watch.”But I persist. Surely, if you are making a drama about trans people, you would want to watch what has gone before. “You’re really stuck on\u0026nbspthis Transparent thing, which is interesting to me,” Mock says, smiling. But, now, it is a hollow smile.She quietly but firmly puts me in my place. “It’s about somebody way older than me, who was a professor. Transparent is about a white, middle-class, liberal family, so there\u0026nbspare no intersections that interest me.”What makes her so excited about Pose is that it is about the very people she knows and cares about. “Our show is centring on trans women of colour in a way they’ve not been centred on ever. What’s so radical to me is that, unlike Transparent, where there is one main character who is trans and played by a man, we have five main characters who are trans played by trans women. That five black and brown trans women will be the centre of a show on a network drama in primetime is huge. And they’re going to be on billboards. It’s\u0026nbspamazing this is going to exist in the world.”I tell Mock I have one final question, from a trans friend of my elder daughter. She asked: “How can a nice trans girl like me find the perfect husband like Aaron,” I say.Mock roars with delight. “That is so sweet! What is her name?” Charlie, I say.“To be in a relationship is an incredibly vulnerable space to be in, so you have to be willing to be open, to not be afraid of that intense gaze on you. Aaron was intense he really wanted to know me. And I chose to show up as myself, and I chose to be vulnerable and tell him my story, and that has been the foundation of our relationship. We’re going to challenge one another by telling the truth to one another, then be strong enough to stick around when that truth is not exactly what we thought we were going to hear. I hope that helps Charlie.”I’m sure it will, I tell her, and\u0026nbspexplain that Charlie is also an\u0026nbspactivist.“What is her second name?” Charlie Craggs, I say.“Oh, I know that name,” she whoops. “I’m not kidding. I follow her on Twitter.” Within seconds, she is searching her Twitter account. “Craggs? Cr … Cra … See, I told you,” she shouts, triumphantly.Two cold brews down, and having just discovered Charlie, she is talking faster than ever. “I love that! It’s a small world. Shows how deeply connected we are! Che-che-che-che.”This is who she has written her books for, she says – the next generation. Mock says she has done her bit: she can now go off and write screenplays and be a boring old binary trans woman. It is up to people like Charlie to take up the cudgels. “There are trans girls who are still navigating these spaces and wanting to learn and grow and they need something fun to look at when they see themselves. They don’t just need to know the tragedy and trauma of being trans. They also need to know how to better be, how to better live, how to better dream.”Surpassing Certainty, Mock’s memoir will be published worldwide on 1 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3afb528eb1ea230cf167b62929c43845457987c4/1822_377_2542_1526/master/2542.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=956f203accf85c6946eb2ec835ce56dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth games the gold coast performances that didnt go to plan","story":"If you are going to have winner, inevitably it means there will be losers. Here are a few of the people who would probably rather forget their time at the 2018 Commonwealth GamesAs the closing ceremony bought the curtain down on 11 days of Commonwealth Games sport at Gold Coast, there were plenty of memories of sporting highlights. And also, a few things that organiser, broadcasters and athletes might rather forget. Here are a few of the things that didn’t go quite so well in Australia...New Zealand’s Elizabeth Cui made a splash of the wrong kind in the women’s 1m springboard preliminary round. The five-time national champion got her e completely wrong, and ended up flopping into the pool on her back, earning her a mark of zero from every judge.But Cui wasn’t the only person to have number trouble during the ing - the judges themselves fell victim to a glitch on the Games’ technical systems, and started the tournament having to mark ers using the back-up system of holding up number cards.One athlete who got excluded from the Games through no fault of her own was English cyclist Melissa Lowther. She was all set to compete in the cycling time trial, but an unticked box on an administrative form meant the authorities excluded her from the start list. Lowther posted on Instagram to express her intense disappointment. There was an early bath for BBC Breakfast presenter Mike Bushell, who contrived to miss a step and fall into a swimming pool while live on air interviewing England Commonwealth Games swimmers Sarah Vasey, Adam Peaty, Siobhan-Marie O’Connor, Ben Proud and James Guy. A regular trope of Olympic Games coverage is about the number of condoms given away for free in the athlete’s village in the expectation that there will be a lot of hook-ups. And there were some red faces among athletes at the Games after some of their postings on Tinder were exposed. Athletes like South African hockey player Nqobile Ntuli were spotted on the dating app, looking “to meet some wild troopers while I am down here”, while Australian swimmer Taylor Mckeown was spotted on the site posing with her silver medal from the 2016 Rio Olympics. Zharnel Hughes found out on his lap of honour that he had been disqualified from the 200m final for impeding Trinidad’s Jereem Richards on the line. He redeemed himself by being part of England’s gold-medal winning 4x100m relay team, but will always look back on what might have been double gold on the Gold Coast track.Organisers were severely criticised after Scotland’s Callum Hawkins collapsed in the closing stages of the men’s marathon on Sunday. Leading by two minutes with less than two miles to go, Hawkins stumbled and appeared to hit his head on the kerbside as he fell.Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive said that assistance had been provided “within agreed response guidelines and timeframes” and expressed concern about bystanders taking photos of the prone athlete rather than assisting. The BBC’s Steve Cram described the delay in medics reaching Hawkins as “disgraceful”.After months of publicity building the Gold Coast up as a wonderful destination for sun, sea and surfing, the worldwide TV audience for the Games’ opening ceremony watched the heavens open and soak the dignitaries and performers as well as the athletes taking part in the opening parade. There was also a nationwide debate in Australia as to what had happened to Borobi - the blue koala mascot - who didn’t appear to feature at all during the opening ceremony, to the extent that organisers had to make a statement about his whereabouts, the hasthag #whereisborobi began, and somebody even set up a parody account to answer them all on Twitter.Organisers had to apologise for printing 15,000 tickets for the opening ceremony with the wrong date on them - and that wasn’t even the only printing error. The late entrance of the Gambia back into the Commonwealth fold left programme-printers embarrassed as the official merchandise for the opening ceremony declared the English capital to be Banjul.At least the opening ceremony was broadly well received, in contrast to the closing ceremony. Athletes had very little role to play in the latter, leading to Australia’s Channel 7 anchors Jo Griggs and Basil Zempilas controversially criticising it on air. “They made decisions not to have athletes enter the stadium” Griggs said. “They made the decision not to show the flag bearers. I’m furious. You want to see the athletes come in. You want to see them jumping in front of camera. You want to see them celebrating 11 days of great sport.”There’s nothing like punching above your weight in sport, and that was true more than ever at this year’s Commonwealth Games for Norfolk Island. They sent a team of 18 athletes from their population of 1,748, meaning that one in every hundred Norfolk Islanders was part of their contingent. Ryan Dixon, Hadyn Evans and Phillip Jones went on to win the bronze in the lawn bowls for the third smallest territory to compete at the Gold Coast. Of teams at the Games, only Gibraltar and Nauru Island are physically smaller than Norfolk Island, and only Niue has a smaller population.

From frustration, unhappiness and even questioning his future in F1 after retirement at the last round in Bahrain, the Australian emerged from a meeting of two halves triumphant and euphoric, having made his mark in the race of the season with emphatic style.Ricciardo’s overtaking was superlative but behind him there was a different picture, with Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel left licking their wounds after finishing in fourth and eighth respectively.Hamilton was relieved that rather than dropping points to the German he has narrowed the gap in the title battle from 17 to nine points but the first half of the race proved that his team have been put on the back foot by Ferrari, who have the quicker car. Valtteri Bottas was second for Mercedes but they have much work to do.Kimi Räikkönen finished in third for Ferrari but they too face questions after their strategy was found wanting. Vettel had led from pole until the pit stops and Mercedes brought Bottas in first while Vettel stayed out. The Finn put in some very quick sectors going for the undercut and a slow stop for the Scuderia cost Vettel and he emerged in second. The win looked to be in Mercedes’s hands, with Hamilton doing his best at damage limitation having started from fourth.But the real drama was yet to come. The two Toro Rossos clashed at turn 14, leaving debris in their wake, and Red Bull’s reaction to the subsequent safety car was swift and tactically astute. They sent both drivers into the pits and they emerged on new, soft rubber with the pace to hunt down the leaders.Max Verstappen was the leader of the two but he was overambitious making a move on Hamilton and went off, losing his place to Ricciardo. The Australian, who had been in sixth, needed no further encouragement. Hamilton fell with a superb piece of late braking into the hairpin, Vettel on the back straight and then Bottas with a e up the inside of turn four that took the breath away. Ricciardo was magnificent and, out of contract at the end of this year, presented a potent reminder of his talent to Ferrari and Mercedes, who both potentially have seats open next season.Yet it had been so close to another resolution-sapping weekend for the Australian. On Saturday, after an engine problem in practice, he only just made qualifying. The team did superbly to fix it and he made the most of it.“This sport’s crazy,” he said. “A week ago I was with my head down. Frustrated at the sport, frustrated at all the variables. Sometimes I question why I chose this sport because there’s so many things out of your control and it does get you down a lot – but then when you have a day like this it’s worth fifty of those bad ones.”Hamilton was forthright that he had been unable to match Ferrari. “I had no pace and was just trying to hold on,” he said. “Yesterday and today was a disaster on my side.”But the team, too, must consider their part. They opted not to send the British driver to the pits for fresh rubber when Red Bull did and it proved costly. The team principal, Toto Wolff, said they had thought track position was more important. “Looking back, it would have been the right strategy to pit but nobody in the team, including myself, though it was the right thing to do at the time,” he said.Hamilton was not willing to apportion blame. “I just struggled with the car,” he said. “Rather than blaming strategy, I was uncomfortable in the car this weekend. The lack of pace, I have to take it upon myself to figure out.”Vettel’s day, serene at the opening, went downhill from the moment he lost the lead. Verstappen, charging once again after his off, was too hot into the hairpin, locked up and collected the German, causing them both to spin. Vettel dropped places and lost balance in the car, leaving him struggling in seventh, a position he lost to Fernando Alonso on the penultimate lap.Verstappen, facing growing criticism for poor decisions after hitting Hamilton in Bahrain, was penalised and apologised but the damage was done. “In that situation he has to change his style, otherwise it will happen again,” Vettel said. “I said to him afterwards: ‘Look, the race is long and you threw your podium away.’”The German was left ruing what might have been an extended lead in the title race but F1 was able to revel in a thrilling contest with a more than worthy winner. “Sometimes you have just got to lick the stamp and send it,” Ricciardo said colourfully of his move on Hamilton and in doing so posted notice of his intent to be a player in this year’s title fight.Verstappen finished in fourth but was classified fifth after his penalty Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in sixth, with his team-mate Carlos Sainz in ninth Alonso in seventh and Kevin Magnussen’s Haas 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6929aaead6e7937a322fa4d8cfc1f7738b20936f/0_189_5034_3021/master/5034.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=62f7233d1fdeb021a606dc60fbc03cf3 1240w","title":"marathon greats condemn games organisers over hawkins treatment","story":"Commonwealth Games organisers were heavily criticised for not providing sufficient medical assistance to a Scottish marathon runner who collapsed but was not attended to by paramedics for several minutes.Callum Hawkins was leading the marathon by almost two minutes and was less than two miles from the finish when he collapsed from heat exhaustion in 30 degree heat. The 25-year-old, who finished fourth at the World Championships marathon in London last summer, had looked set for gold but he began to sway in distress and fell over on the curb.He managed to rouse himself and briefly continued but supported himself several times using the metal barriers lining the course. But he collapsed again shortly afterwards, hitting his head on one of the roadside barriers. Hawkins was taken to hospital and is sat up and talking with no obvious long term damage done but fellow athletes and former athletes were damning of how long it took for professional assistance to arrive.Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were “big questions” for the local organising committee and medical staff. “That should never happen,” she said.Some spectators even took pictures of a stricken Hawkins with nobody seeming to offer any help. Commentating on the BBC, former middle distance runner Steve Cram said it was “a disgrace” that it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins.“I’m just concerned for his welfare,” Cram said, “He hit his head on the barrier. I’m sorry if you’re watching this at home, it’s really distressing. He’s going to hurt himself and there’s nobody anywhere near. We should have some more medical attention.” “This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point. Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They’ve got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it’s disgraceful.”Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive, said: “I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today’s marathon. We are offering every assistance possible to Callum and Team Scotland.” “Gold Coast 2018 has put in place a wide range of measures to ensure athlete welfare and the response of medical staff this morning was within agreed response guidelines and timeframes. I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Gold Coast 2018.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b457655760cf929f275aed013e5f386f075f993c/0_0_3503_2346/master/3503.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18e82d3b0f3b9db98253744aaa59510e 1320w","title":"josie long and jonny donahoe having a baby","story":"Just a month before their first child is due, the standup couple are doing a show together – seeking the audience’s parenting tips“It’s mad,” says Josie Long, “but it feels like the right thing to do.” Braving the blustery weather at a pavement cafe near their east London home, Long and fellow comedian Jonny Donahoe are discussing their unlikely new project, which enjoys its first and only UK performance next week. For Josie Long and Jonny Donahoe Are Having a Baby (With You), the couple take to the stage to chat, joke and desperately seek advice on the imminent arrival of their first child. They’re taking one of the most intimate experiences a couple can have, and making it public when Long is eight months pregnant – heavy, exhausted and, she says, “physically vulnerable”. What are they thinking?And so it came to pass – albeit earlier than intended when accidental pregnancy interrupted their meticulous schedule. The couple were touring together in the political cabaret Lefty Scum. Then Long had planned to write a new standup set “about welcoming someone to the whole world. I thought it’d be such a beautiful thing, and I’d tour it loads, then we’d start trying for a baby, and I’d feel in a really good place.” Instead, the couple found themselves unexpectedly expecting on the back of few “tricky” years, as Long describes them, when she’d been ill and “not writing as much as I’d like”.“So we’re in a position of uncertainty and unpreparedness,” she says. “We’re excited and happy, but it’s frightening and unusual too. That’s where the show comes from. We wanted to have fun with that – and to ask advice from people who are parents too.” They staged an early version in Brooklyn in March, with Daily Show contributor – and parent – John Hodgman as special guest. (In London, it’s Christie.) They posed fretful questions like: “What happens if you lose the kid?” Hodgman and the audience supplied soothing counsel in response.And in return for the advice, what will their show (and the podcast that may follow) offer audiences? Having read “lots of bad books on the subject”, in Donahoe’s words, the pair aim to puncture some of what Long calls the “unhelpful, unscientific or deep-rooted in sexist bullshit” myths surrounding pregnancy. “To do a show,” she continues, “about becoming parents from – what I now realise is – our unconventional perspective. We want to coparent and we’re aware of how unusual that is.” Their job helps with this aspiration. “As comedians, we’re quite time-rich,” Donahoe says. “We can both take time off. Standup is a very flexible job.” “And also,” Long adds, “we’re both very open in our work and like to talk about what’s happening in our lives.” On the ethics of making their pregnancy public property, she admits “it’s really tricky. As comedians you want to share – but you want to share what you want to share. And there will always be people who cross the boundary in the wrong way.” Last month, in what became a comedy cause celebre, standup Louise Reay was sued by her ex-husband for breach of privacy. But “I’m not going to sue you,” Jonny promises Josie. “What would I get if I sued you? I haven’t even paid you back for half the sofa.”Long admits to anxieties, too, about how parenthood may affect her career in a still-sexist industry. “I miss having my brain being my own,” she confesses. “And I hope that once we’ve had our little maternity period I can write another show, tour it, and we can travel as a family.” Finally, that prospect – of new adventures, new horizons – eclipses any anxiety. “I’ve been writing shows that say, ‘I feel like I’m not growing up enough’ – and I don’t want to do that for ever. I want to write shows that say, ‘This is what life is like for me now,’ that tackle the world in a new way. So I’m really up for it. I think having a baby will change our perspective and be difficult and new and unusual. And I embrace all of that.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b61eca6b4e5d08c1ddcd8f60b7591c5124edfc/0_162_4866_2920/master/4866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=da127dcb2eb22d3d909c2a32aa0e0207 1240w","title":"facebook mark zuckerberg security spending","story":"In all the company has spent about $20m on security and private planes for Zuckerberg since 2015. The security funds were required ‘due to specific threats to his safety’The security funds were required “due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder, chairman, and CEO,” the under-fire social media company said in a new filing to US regulators.Facebook also said it spent more than $1.5m (£1m) on Zuckerberg’s travel aboard private jets in 2017, meaning that in all the company has spent about $20m on security and private planes for Zuckerberg since 2015.Security measures at Zuckerberg’s home in California are paid for by the company, according to the filing, as well as bodyguards who accompany the 33-year-old on his travels outside Facebook’s headquarters.“We require these security measures for the company’s benefit because of the importance of Mr Zuckerberg to Facebook, and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary,” the company said. Zuckerberg has come under sharp criticism for his company’s role in the spread of disinformation and political propaganda online. Last week he faced 10 hours of questions from US congressional committees but escaped largely unscathed.The hearings were prompted by the disclosure by the Observer that tens of millions of Facebook users had their data harvested by a researcher working with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.The filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that Zuckerberg continued to take a token $1 (70p) annual salary for his work at Facebook, which he founded as a student at Harvard University.Zuckerberg’s fortune, which fluctuates with Facebook’s stock price, has recently totalled about $70bn (£49bn). He consistently appears in lists of the world’s top ten richest people.About $2.7m (£1.9m) was spent in 2017 on security for Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, according to the company. That total was only slightly higher than Sandberg’s security bill in 2016.Sandberg, who has assisted Zuckerberg on an apology tour since news broke of the exploitation of users’ data, received a total pay package last year of more than $22.5m (£15.8m) in salary, bonuses and company stock.Facebook said in the filing that the spending totals cited for Zuckerberg’s use of private planes “include passenger fees, fuel, crew, and catering costs”. Zuckerberg raised alarms last week by stating during the congressional hearings that Facebook collects “data of people who have not signed up for Facebook,” apparently for security reasons.No further information was offered on this disclosure, prompting calls from privacy campaigners for Facebook to explain how it gathers data on non-users and what information is retained by the company.Zuckerberg also warned last week of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia and said that fighting interference in elections around the world was now his top priority as Facebook’s boss.Earlier this month the company said it had discovered and removed 273 accounts and pages that were being run on its platforms by the so-called Internet Research Agency (IRA), a notorious Russian government “troll farm”.“The IRA has repeatedly used complex networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate people who use Facebook, including before, during and after the 2016 US presidential elections,” Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, said in a blog post announcing the action.Prosecutors working for Robert Mueller, the special counsel, have charged Russian operatives with using social media platforms including Facebook to pose as American activists and sow political discord during the 2016 campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

The epic ride ends in a cosy pub just as rain sweeps in“You used to be able to ride through here,” I said. “Yes,” replied my friend Mark, “but that was more than 20 years ago.”We were looking for a dirt road through Cwm Henog forest, to the west of Llanwrtyd Wells in mid-Wales. I cycled around here regularly in the 1980s and 90s when I started mountain biking but things change, even in these remote hills: I simply couldn’t find that old road.But we had a good alternative route planned for our three-day gravel bike adventure. We’d head north on a minor road from Llanwrtyd Wells through thick woodland along the Irfon river, then turn left at the hamlet of Abergwesyn to ride over lovely Abergwesyn Common, with impressive crags looming on either side.Things became more challenging at the Devil’s Staircase, a hideously steep climb up the southern slopes of the Cambrian mountains, where I got off and pushed. I was “bikepacking” on a relatively heavy gravel bike with knobbly tyres and a large seatpack, and carrying a small rucksack.A gravel bike, if you were wondering, is essentially a road bike that has relaxed frame angles (for a more comfortable riding position), can run wider, knobbly tyres for riding off-road and comes with mudguards and mounts for panniers.Our route would take in minor country roads, forest roads and dirt tracks in the Cambrian mountains, although our first off-road action didn’t come until we’d sped down the north-west side of the Devil’s Staircase, along the eastern bank of Llyn Brianne reservoir and across the dam’s impressive spillway to hit the dirt road along the reservoir’s western shore.My knobbly tyres sailed over the rough surface and soon we were in Soar-y-Mynydd, a whitewashed chapel built in 1822, and apparently the most remote chapel in Wales.From here, we rode on rough tarmac for 10 miles or so across windy moorlands to Tregaron, and rooms for the night at Y Talbot hotel (doubles from £85 B\u0026ampB), which may have the UK’s most powerful showers – perfect after a day’s biking.Next day, after a huge breakfast, we had an easy start, riding along the flat Ystwyth Trail, which follows the route of the old Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railway beside Cors Caron, a huge raised bog where otters thrive, along with the region’s soaring red kites.This being mid-Wales, it was only a matter of time before things began to go uphill. At Pontrhydfendigaid, we hit the smooth tarmac of the B4343, then climbed on a potholed road east across open moorland to the far-flung Teifi Pools and eventually, after five miles and 300 metres of ascent, we were back on dirt.This dirt track wound through some of the most isolated terrain in the UK, between vast expanses of desolate moorland, then skirted the steel-grey waters of the Claerwen reservoir before dropping down to the Elan Valley. Here we enjoyed some shelter from an increasingly strong wind as we descended into the thickly wooded valley and, for the first time in over 10 miles, encountered people again. It’s probably fair to say there are few roads south of Scotland – even dirt roads – where you can travel such a distance in complete solitude.After a night at the Elan Valley Hotel (doubles from £75 B\u0026ampB) – opened when the Elan Valley reservoirs were being built at the turn of the 20th century – our final day saw us cycling past Rhayader and down to the Wye, which we crossed on a narrow suspension bridge sporting a sign advising cyclists to dismount. I’d be pleased to see a person riding a bike across that bridge …From here, a gradual climb saw us wend our way along an ancient moorland bridleway as southerly winds threw big, splashy raindrops in our faces – just as you’d expect in Wales.By the time we got back to Llanwrtyd Wells and rode past the Neuadd Arms, the rain was hammering down, so we felt duty bound to pop in for a pint. Thirty years ago, before trail centres took over, this pub was a focal point of British mountain biking maybe the new vogue for gravel biking will bring back those glory days.• Clive Powell in Rhayader hires out mountain and hybrid bikes from £24 a day"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures.

But with a direct clash between Russia and the US unlikely, Moscow may look for other ways to strike back at the west, using Russia’s status as superpower spoiler to undermine key goals of US foreign policy.There are a number of ways that Russia could cause problems for the US and its allies abroad by providing more advanced arms to Syria or helping North Korea flout sanctions, as well as heating up the Ukraine crisis, launching cyberattacks or upping support for rightwing populist politicians across Europe.Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family. The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue.Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army. Islamist groups join the revolt.Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment. Other bloody operations are carried out, notably in the central city of Hama, after massive anti-regime protests.FSA fighters launch a battle for Damascus but the government holds firm.More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus.The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria\u0027s chemical weapons, averting punitive US strikes against the regime.Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north. The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa – the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control – from rebel forces.A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria. The strikes benefit Kurdish groups, which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas.Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad\u0027s troops, who are on the back foot. Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory.Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides. The process leads to the creation of four de-escalation zones.A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people, prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase.Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict, Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People\u0027s Protection Units which, with US support, played a key role in beating back Isis.Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus, eastern Ghouta. In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.But Moscow may opt not to escalate, as it did not after the US cruise missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in 2017, recognising that the strikes were a one-off largely designed to send a political message and would not have a long-term impact on Assad’s prospects or the war in Syria.That would leave the door open to another prize that analysts say Russia wants at the moment: a public summit between Putin and Donald Trump like the one the US president had proposed in a phone call last month, which could change, or at least marginally improve, the dynamic in Moscow’s favour.From a simple point of view, Saturday’s missile strikes appear to be the latest escalation on Syria’s crowded battlefield, where a half-dozen countries and their proxies are jostling for influence and territory.Moscow’s nominal response was to convene a UN security council session to condemn the strikes (its resolution failed to pass) and threaten to sell advanced Russian S-300 air defence systems to Syria and other countries, deterring interventions in Syria for states such as Israel.Sanctions are another possibile response. Russian lawmakers are already proposing countermeasures to US sanctions earlier this month that targeted businessmen close to Putin and sent Russian stocks tumbling.Russia may block access to its market for imports of food and drink or target companies such as Boeing by banning titanium exports. But Moscow lacks the economic heft to inflict equal pain through sanctions and some ideas proposed by lawmakers sound outlandish, like allowing Russian firms to pirate US products by ignoring intellectual property law.Other possible responses include the use of cyber-weapons, which have increasingly played a role in the jousting between Russia and the west since 2014, with hackers cracking power grids and other key infrastructure, leaking sensitive political information and stealing private communications between government officials.Earlier this year, the UK government publicly accused Russia of launching the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack that crippled key infrastructure and firms across Europe, including some hospitals in the UK. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused Russia in February of “ripping up the rulebook”. “We have entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber-attacks,” he warned.Through its proxies, Russia could also seek to put pressure on US troops who are fighting in Syria alongside opposition forces. But that could also put Russians at risk. Earlier this week, the CIA director Mike Pompeo told the Senate that US forces had killed “a couple hundred” Russian mercenaries in a shadowy clash that had taken place in February.Despite the heated rhetoric, Saturday’s strike may paradoxically signal a de-escalation. There was a sense of relief in Moscow, and one of defiance in Syria, as it became clear that the strikes would be limited to three sites in Syria linked to chemical weapons production.Seen in context, the attack concluded a tense public negotiation that allowed the US and other western countries to respond to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons without sparking an all-out war with Russia. After the strikes, all sides declared victory.Analysts, some who serve Russia in advisory capacities, said this week that a direct military response from Moscow would be extremely unlikely unless Russia’s red line – a threat to its soldiers in Syria – were crossed. Russia could likely brush off the attack, they said, publicly complaining but privately staying its course in Syria that has seen the Assad regime brought back from near defeat. A limited response could keep a meeting with Trump on the table, they said, and the US leader’s unpredictability meant that could provide a very attractive upside. “We’ll buzz your ships,” one said of Moscow’s expected retaliation. “I don’t think we’re about to sink the USS Cook.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0874326490d780dc4ce98bb55d062141c62c8799/0_135_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a08fbbd04599e307ce13d2f812f42f5f 1240w","title":"montenegro votes in first presidential election since joining nato","story":"Poll seen as test for former PM Milo Đukanović, who favours European integration over closer ties to MoscowVoters in Montenegro are casting their ballots in a presidential election that the former prime minister Milo Đukanović is expected to win after his party defied Russia and took the small Balkan country into Nato last year.The vote is the first since Montenegro joined the western military alliance in December. It is seen as a test for Đukanović, who favours European integration over closer ties to its traditional ally Moscow.Đukanović, the country’s dominant politician, and his Democratic Party of Socialists have ruled Montenegro for nearly 30 years. The outgoing president, Filip Vujanović, is not running, due to term limits.About 530,000 voters can choose between several candidates in the country on the Adriatic Sea. Đukanović’s main challenger is Mladen Bojanić, who is backed by several opposition groups, including pro-Russian parties. Polls suggest the 56-year-old Đukanović could win more than half of the votes on Sunday and avoid a runoff. Casting his vote on Sunday, Bojanić described Đukanović as an “autocrat leading Montenegro into a dictatorship”.“The majority in Montenegro want a free and democratic Montenegro,” Bojanić said.Đukanović was prime minister during a tense October 2016 parliamentary election when authorities said they thwarted a pro-Russian coup attempt designed to prevent the country from joining Nato.He led Montenegro to independence from its much larger neighbour Serbia in 2006 and was behind the Nato bid. He hopes next to steer the country into the European Union.Bojanić, an economic expert and former lawmaker, has accused the ruling party of corruption and links to organised crime following a spike in crime-related violence.The fractured opposition parties supporting Bojanić include the pro-Russian Democratic Front, whose two main leaders are on trial for taking part in the alleged 2016 coup attempt.Two Russian citizens also are being tried in absentia for the plot, which prosecutors said included a plan to assassinate Đukanović. The Kremlin has denied involvement.Voter Zdravko Ivanovic, 84, praised Đukanović’s leadership after leaving a polling station Sunday in Podgorica, the capital. He described Đukanović as “the best statesman and prime minister, the best and finest Montenegrin giant”. Radmila Čagorović, a voter in her late 50s, disagreed. “We have waited so long for a change,” she said. “I hope it will happen today.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462342.1523788766!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"assad says syrian air strikes were act of aggression reports","story":"More chemical attacks in Syria will not be tolerated and the U.S. is prepared to strike again according to US Vice President Mike Pence, who added his voice to the chorus of warnings to Syria. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center which was targeted in air strikes. Photograph: Hassan AmmarAPSyrian president Bashar al-Assad told a group of Russian politicians on Sunday that Western missile strikes on his country were an act of aggression, Russian news agencies reported.Russian politicians met with Mr Assad after the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities, including a research and development centre in the Barzeh district of Damascus and two installations near Homs.The bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Mr Assad and his superpower ally Russia, but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Mr Assad or intervening in the civil war.Russian news agencies quoted politicians as saying Mr Assad was in a “good mood” and had praised the Soviet-era air defence systems used by Syria to help to repel the Western attacks.The supply of Russian air defence systems was not discussed, agencies reported, but Mr Assad accepted an invitation to visit the Siberian region of Khanty-Mansi in Russia. It was not clear when the visit would take place.US president Donald Trump called the operation a success, tweeting “Mission accomplished”.The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that Mr Trump told her that if Syria uses poisonous gas again, “The United States is locked and loaded.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes were “unacceptable and lawless.”Syrian state media called them a “flagrant violation of international law,” while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called it a crime and the Western leaders criminals.Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally, but the Pentagon said no Russian air defence systems were used. Syria fired 40 unguided surface-to-air missiles - but only after the Western strikes had ended, the Pentagon said.British prime minister Theresa May described the strike as “limited and targeted,” with no intention of toppling Assad or intervening more widely in the war.Ms May has faced a backlash from MPs, with Jeremy Corbyn calling for a war powers act to give parliament more scrutiny over military action.Appearing on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, the Labour leader questioned the legal basis for the UK joining the US and France in air strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma.Mr Corbyn said Parliament should have been given a vote ahead of the strikes.“I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.”The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a “proxy war” between the US and Russia. He said chlorine has been used by “a number of parties in the conflict” in Syria as a weapon.Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to “get the moral high ground around the world” it must abide by international law for taking military action.“Where is the legal basis for this?” he said.Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said “finally the world has said enough is enough” as he defended the “proportionate” action.“There is no proposal on the table at the moment for further attacks because so far — thank heavens — the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack.”Mr Johnson added: “If and when such a thing were to happen then clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all Security Council members to exercise restraint and avoid escalation in Syria, but said allegations of chemical weapons use demand an investigation.In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull urged Russia to drop its “pretence” that Syria was not behind the chemical attack on Douma and use its influence to force the Assad government to destroy its chemical weapons.“Russia has used its position as a member of the United Nations Security Council to veto resolutions designed to ensure that this chemical weapons crime is thoroughly investigated and cannot be repeated,” he told a news conference on Sunday.Washington described the strike targets as a centre near Damascus for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post.The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets, and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria’s ability to produce such weapons.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict for years, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops on the ground to fight that group. But they have refrained from targeting Assad’s government, apart from a volley of US missiles last year.Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings.Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated to levels of Cold War-era hostility, has denied any gas attack took place in Douma and even accused Britain of staging it to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma. Damascus is still permitted to have chlorine for civilian use, although its use as a weapon is banned. Allegations of Assad’s chlorine use have been frequent during the war although, unlike nerve agents, chlorine did not produce mass casualties as seen last week.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462361.1523789314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"syria air strikes where is the legal basis asks corbyn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn appearing on the BBC1 current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show. Photograph: BBCPAUK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a war powers Act to prevent British governments from taking military action without parliamentary approval.Theresa May will make a statement to MPs on Monday outlining why she authorised British forces to take part in Saturday’s bombardment of Syria, along with the United States and France.Mr Corbyn said the air strikes may have been illegal, despite the government’s assertion that it was allowed under international law to take military action to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering.“If we want to get the moral high ground, as a country with a history of international involvement, then we need to abide by international law, and I say to the foreign secretary, and I say to the prime minister, where is the legal basis for this?” he told the BBC.Mr Corbyn said the concept of humanitarian intervention was contested and that the only legal bases for military action were self-defence, or the authority of the UN security council.“I think parliament should have a say in this, and the prime minister could quite easily have done that. What we need in this country is something more robust, like a war powers act, so that governments do get held to account by parliament for what they do in our name,” he said.The US, France and Britain fired 105 missiles into Syria on Saturday, targeting chemical weapons facilities, in response to a chemical attack on the town of Douma, which had been a rebel stronghold. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the air strikes were designed to deter Bashar al-Assad’s regime and others around the world from using chemical weapons.“It’s important that we understand the limits of what we are trying to do. This is not going to turn the tide of the conflict in Syria one can hope it encourages the Russians to the negotiating table in Geneva, to get a political process properly going - but that is, as it were, an extra. The primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons,” he said.President Donald Trump has celebrated the air strikes as a success, tweeting “Mission Accomplished” and the Pentagon said the missiles had struck at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons programme. Washington said that Syrian anti-aircraft defences had “no material effect” on the operation, contrary to Russian claims that most of the missiles had been shot down.As British ministers stressed the limited nature of the air-strikes, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Mr Trump was ready to strike again if Syria used chemical weapons in the future.“I spoke to the president this morning, and he said, ‘If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.’ When our president draws a red line, our president enforces the red line,” she said.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

If they wanted to go, I\u0027d let them. Because they get really well fed 95 per cent of the time from us. If they want to go out and have a fizzy drink I don\u0027t care, because we have none in the house. My wife\u0027s probably stricter. She\u0027d say, \u0026quotOh please, don\u0027t.\u0026quot But they\u0027d only end up doing it in some other place.\u0026quotHe told the Mail on Sunday that they probably wouldn\u0027t want to go in the first place \u0026quotbut for me as a parent, because I know they get really well looked after at home, I wouldn\u0027t tell them not to. I don\u0027t want to alienate them from having a burger or having a pizza.\u0026quotJamie Oliver says that everything can be enjoyed in moderation He said that he was not calling for people never to drink a fizzy drink, but that it needed to be in moderation and alongside a balanced diet.  Mr Oliver said that he has launched his latest campaign - in which he has set out an 11 point plan for change - because he felt it was the \u0026quotright thing to do\u0026quot despite the fact that \u0026quothaving an opinion and caring is really bumpy in Britain\u0026quot. He is also calling for national programmes to measure and weigh children, for Ofsted to monitor school dinners and compulsory targets for sugar and calorie reduction in food and drinks. The celebrity chef, who admitted that his business has faced a tough year, defended high sugar content in some of his own recipes, saying that overall his recipes were balanced.He said: \u0026quotWhat I\u0027m trying to say is that if you help people get it right most of the time there\u0027s plenty of space to get it wrong.

But the problem is that I do not know which side he is on,\u0026quot he added.However, Mr Djukanovic has claimed that the opposition wants to turn the country into a \u0026quotRussian province\u0026quot and threaten Montenegro\u0027s multicultural way of life.Mr Djukanovic was prime minister during a tense October 2016 parliamentary election when authorities said they thwarted a pro-Russian coup attempt designed to prevent the country from joining Nato.Two Russian citizens are being tried in absentia for the plot, which prosecutors said included a plan to assassinate Mr Djukanovic. The Kremlin has denied any involvement.In 2006, Mr Djukanovic led Montenegro to independence from Serbia, which also hopes to became an EU member within the next seven years. Speaking to local media after casting his vote, Zdravko Ivanovic, 84, praised Mr Djukanovic\u0027s leadership, describing him as \u0026quotthe best statesman and prime minister, the best and finest Montenegrin giant.\u0026quotBut Radmila Cagorovic, a voter in her late 50s, disagreed - \u0026quotwe have waited so long for a change.

These bags allow people, especially those who are time-poor, to just ‘rip and tip’ the meat straight into the frying pan without touching it, ” Katherine Hall, product development manager for meat, fish and poultry at the retailer, told The Sunday Times.The fear of contamination by bacteria such as campylobacter, which is found in some raw poultry and can cause severe food poisoning, was so great that one woman admitted in a focus group to coating her chicken with antibacterial spray before cooking it, Hall recalled.“A lot of younger people are eating out in restaurants but they are not preparing as much food in their home.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May gives a press conference at Downing Street following British military action, alongside US and France, against Syria.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yes, that’s about where we are.“The government is listening on the important aspects of the bill and I think that’s what the overall tone of the debate from the crossbenchers will be – that, actually, the government is listening and taking appropriate action.“But there was always going to be a time when this type of amendment, the customs union amendment, was going to cause a bit of a clash. We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
