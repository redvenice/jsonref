A retired school teacher, she keeps a flock of sheep, a coop of hens, a dog and a cat on her mountain smallholding in Wales. She loves gardening and is currently reading the complete works of Trollope on her Kindle.Every day she completes a newspaper crossword — usually in about five minutes — but she hasn’t a clue about smart technology. She’s unnerved and confused by it.         Frances writes: Mum regards this as a frightening and stealthy technological take over that is threatening to rob her, and millions of elderly people like her, of their last vestiges of independenceShe was born in 1927, when the internal combustion engine was only just taking the place of the horse and carriage. So consider the dismay with which she greeted the news that Sainsbury’s has recently launched the country’s first till-free grocery store in Holborn, Central London. No staff at checkouts. No checkouts at all, in fact. You just scan your items using the supermarket’s Smartshop app on your phone, on which you pay. It’s said to be the supermarket of the future — and a-not-too distant future, either.Mum regards this as a frightening and stealthy technological take over that is threatening to rob her, and millions of elderly people like her, of their last vestiges of independence.Not even pictures of the Queen, taken last month as the sovereign tried out a self-service till and shopping app during a trip to Sainsbury’s to commemorate the chain’s 150th birthday, could reassure Mum. If anything Her Majesty, who’s a year older, looked equally baffled.Along with our disappearing post offices, which are going out of business by the thousand as customers turn to the internet to pay bills and order stamps — and which prompted a Daily Mail campaign — the speed of change is leaving old people like my mother behind.Simple every day tasks, like buying a train ticket, paying a bill and now doing your weekly shop, could soon be tasks her generation find confusing and beyond their grasp. And with social care for the elderly in crisis, if they reach out for help, who knows if they’ll get it?         Simple every day tasks, like buying a train ticket, paying a bill and now doing your weekly shop, could soon be tasks her generation find confusing and beyond their graspThe UK population is getting older: 18 per cent are now aged 65 and over and the trend is set to continue.In 50 years, there are likely to be an additional 8.6 million people in this age group — a population roughly the size of London. And the fastest increase will be in the 85 years and over group.For many elderly a walk to the shops is their only contact with the outside world a chat to a check-out assistant their sole source of conversation. Bereft of such daily routines they would become lonely, isolated and prey to depression.Not surprisingly, Sainsbury’s is excited about its first checkout-free supermarket, which opened in April.‘We know our customers value their time and many want to shop as quickly as possible — technology is key to that,’ claims Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s group chief digital officer.Whoah there! As quickly as possible? Perhaps for 20-somethings who’ve grown up with smartphones and computers. But not for the oldies (I’m a relatively youthful 61, and even I struggle with a lot of it).To demonstrate to the likes of Ms Moriarty how devastating these changes are to older generations, my mother and I spent a day going about our business, at a town near my home in West Sussex, and trying out the fully automated world.The palaver at the supermarket — a relatively low-tech one compared with the Central London branch — left her declaring that she’d ‘rather join a queue that went twice round Trafalgar Square than go to one of those whatchamacallit checkouts’.Mum’s idea of a good shopping experience is the one she already has: once a week, a community bus takes her to Asda.         Jane says: \u0027Why ever would I want to try to do it all myself? And what about the jobs of all the people who work in the shops if I did?\u0027She says: ‘And when I’ve done my shopping I wheel my trolley to a nice sales assistant at a till who asks me how I am and how my grandchildren are, and sits there without complaint as I shuffle through dozens of debit cards until I find one that actually works.‘There’s even someone who packs all my groceries into bags, puts them back into the trolley and helps me wheel it to the bus. It’s a wonderful service. Why ever would I want to try to do it all myself? And what about the jobs of all the people who work in the shops if I did?’Besides these concerns, she’s anxious about security. The thought of paying by mobile — using a function linking your phone to your debit or credit card — worries her. Mum has a credit card, which she can use if she needs to, but like most people her age she prefers cash.‘Even if I could work out how to pay for my shopping on my phone, I’d worry that I’d pressed the wrong keys and paid for it several times over. And what if you lost your phone? Would someone else be able to do their grocery shopping on it?’Many oldies share these concerns. Mario Ambrosi, spokesman for Anchor Hanover, a not-for-profit housing organisation for the elderly, says many elderly people feel ‘under pressure’ if they don’t respond quickly enough to automated check-outs, and find shopping a ‘miserable experience’ if there is no one to talk to at the tills.Next on our list, as I introduce Mum to the automated world, is buying a train ticket. To begin with, we try to buy one on Mum’s iPad. (Yes, she has one! But she’s never used it for any monetary transaction and she’d rather not start now.)Nonetheless, I help her locate Trainline and we set about buying two tickets to a seaside suburb. Both of us have Senior Railcards and if I guide Mum step-by-step through the process, she manages.         While most mainline stations have a manned ticket office, many suburban stations do not. Of course, buying the ticket online is only part of the ordeal for the bemused oldie: next comes the challenge of collecting it from a machine at the stationHowever, although we’ve pressed the button that says ‘travel card’ when we come to check out, we find our senior discount hasn’t been applied. It feels like such an almighty faff to go back and do it all again, we capitulate and pay the full price.‘Why couldn’t we just buy one at the station?’ Mum asks reasonably. ‘At home, I go to the man in the ticket office with my pensioner’s card and he’ll find me the cheapest ticket to where I want to go. You have to do it in advance to get the best deals, but I’m happy to plan ahead.’Alas, while most mainline stations have a manned ticket office, many suburban stations do not. As more tickets are bought online, it’s easy to see which way the wind is blowing on this front.Of course, buying the ticket online is only part of the ordeal for the bemused oldie: next comes the challenge of collecting it from a machine at the station.Apparently, even this method is due to be phased out, and we’ll soon be compelled to negotiate our way through station barriers using e-tickets sent to our smartphones. But navigating this system proves a challenge too far for Mum and me.(And we pause to consider the elderly who haven’t even got smartphones. Won’t this just be one more step towards their social isolation?)So off we go, armed with our eight- digit collection reference code to redeem our train tickets.However, before this mission is accomplished we have to buy a ticket for the station car park.This used to be a painless process. You could do it while buying your rail ticket and exchanging pleasantries with the two cheerful employees at my local station in West Sussex. Now, however, the blighted automation has taken over. A yellow sign at the entrance trumpets the arrival of the new parking app.Weariness descends. Downloading an app seems too much to bother Mum with, so we decide to see if it’s easier to pay by credit card over the phone. Has Mum got her phone with her? Miraculously she has. Is it charged? Nope. (This is no surprise, as it rarely is.)         Director of charity Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, remarks: ‘Older people who are not avid users of smartphones and the internet, and who like a friendly chat at the till while out shopping, are likely to be made miserable by the latest technology developments\u0027 (Jane paying for parking)So we use my phone and Mum is ready to surrender immediately when a robotic voice orders her to register her card number followed by the hash key, and key in her car registration number.She’s not a quitter. But the relentless frustrations of technology confound her. ‘I don’t like machine voices,’ she says. ‘You can get a reaction and help from a human voice — machines don’t know you’re 92 and can’t see very well.’Reluctantly, we give up. Mum is defeated by a task which could so easily have been accomplished if she’d had people — either a human voice on the phone, or someone in the ticket office — to help her. I leave Mum on the platform and go and park several streets away. With minutes to spare, I return to the station to see if Mum can retrieve our train tickets from the electronic machine, using an access code which was emailed to us on the iPad.To help her, I read out the ticket collection code, which (painstakingly slowly) she keys in, and when our tickets pop into the tray it feels like a triumph.So after hours of ‘prodding, poking and swiping,’ as Mum describes it, she’s achieved one minor victory: she’s bought a ticket. But she wants to assure me of one thing: she’s not a convert to the new-fangled ways. In future, she’ll be going back to her old-fashioned ones. Cheery check-out assistants, helpful bank tellers, tickets that can be paid for over a counter: these are the services that aid Mum’s independence and add to the sum of her happiness. Without them — smart though she is — she flounders in uncharted waters.         ‘It makes such a difference if you have grown up with computers or used them at work and this isn’t the case with our oldest pensioners,’ Ms Abrahams said, adding, however, that advancing years should not be a barrier to getting online. (Frances and mother Jane paying for parking)Director of charity Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, remarks: ‘Older people who are not avid users of smartphones and the internet, and who like a friendly chat at the till while out shopping, are likely to be made miserable by the latest technology developments. We hope that their needs and wishes will be taken into account by retailers.’She recognises that while new technology has lots to offer the elderly, half of all over-75s are not online ‘and probably never will be’.‘It makes such a difference if you have grown up with computers or used them at work and this isn’t the case with our oldest pensioners,’ she says, adding, however, that advancing years should not be a barrier to getting online.Indeed, the charity runs programmes to help seniors gain internet skills. Would Mum sign up for one? Possibly. If she wasn’t gardening, looking after her animals, visiting friends and relatives, reading weighty Victorian novels or doing crosswords.She is inherently good-humoured and optimistic, but we return from our day out weary and mildly exasperated. In many ways, Mum is lucky, as she has family and help. I can’t help thinking of all the old people out there who don’t.We settle down with a cuppa and a slice of cherry bakewell. ‘Now where’s my crossword?’ she asks, grabbing Biro and the newspaper.‘Clue: solid ground. That’s terra firma,’ she says without a second’s hesitation. It’s good to know she’s back on familiar territory, in a world she knows and understands.For more information about support to get online, call 0800 055 6112 or visit ageuk.org.ukit"},{"url":null,"title":"United Airlines plane taken service passengers complain ant infestation","story":"Share this article \u0027This is where things start to get more inept.

The work is displayed in venues across Madrid, and in a further six cities, until 1 September PhotoEa, Madrid’s annual celebration of photography, offers an extensive programme of exhibitions to suit all tastes. The work of established figures such William Klein, Berenice Abbott, and Manuel Álvarez Bravo is on display alongside shows introducing young, emerging European photographers. The subjects of the exhibitions are equally erse, ranging from rare Soviet photobooks to snapshots bought on eBay, from collective projects decades in the making to solo undertakings completed in months.Among the many highlights is a comprehensive overview of photography projects by Stephen Shore, Josef Koudelka, Lewis Baltz, Sophie Ristelhueber and Raymond Depardon, who were officially commissioned to chart the changing landscapes of Europe from the early 1980s to the present day. Two exhibitions celebrate Donna Ferrato’s tireless work in combating domestic abuse. And the late Leila Alaoui’s sympathetic portraits of The Moroccans are displayed to sober effect at Casa Árabe.At the heart of the festival are five exhibitions of art photography, gathered under the heading deja vu because of their dependence on antecedent traditions, ideas and works, which reflect on the current nature, limits and possibilities of the medium. Elina Brotherus, for example, produces work that engages with the legacy of conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s. Clare Strand makes painted versions of tabloid photographs. Patrick Pound and Délio Jasse reinterpret archival material to radically different ends. Laura Letinsky and Sharon Core use the still life as a means of raising questions about genre, tradition and reproduction.A vibrant retrospective of the work of the US photographer William Klein presents his pictures in a display as energetic, innovative and brash as the photographs themselves. Included here are rarely seen early paintings as a student of Fernand Léger, uncompromising street photography, iconoclastic fashion work, starkly abstract scientific studies, painted contact sheets and vivid film work.For more than 10 years, Javier Vallhonrat has explored, studied and photographed the Maladeta glacier in the Pyrenees. The duration of the project, the intensity of its focus and the rigour of the fieldwork are evident in the imposing and magisterial works on show. Aerial imagery outlines the development of the Maladeta over time. And ground level pictures, assembled as collages, reveal the scarred surfaces of the glacier. Their presentation suggests tectonic plates perhaps, and the fragmentary nature of Vallhonrat’s subjectElina Brotherus exhibits a body of work that follows the protocols and strictures of conceptual artists of the 1960s and 70s, especially the Fluxus group. Her photographs are records of her staged enactments of proposals, or “scores”, issued by the group as guides for artistic practice. Self-expression, artistic freedom and autobiography are thereby reined in. Like all good conceptualists, Brotherus appears impeccably deadpan throughout, though she did confide that there was plenty of off-camera laughter between shoots.Collector Patrick Pound curates an exhibition of vintage photographs of erse subjects thematically unified by the show’s invisible focus, air. Flags, wind instruments, hot air balloons and wind-blown hair abound in a playful show that attests to Pound’s wit and imagination – and to the power of Google image searches and eBay.Offland showcases eight young European photographers, among them Eirini Vourloumis and Myrto Papadopoulos, whose work addresses, to varying degrees, themes of imagined Arcadias, refuge and identity. Papadopoulos’s understated yet compelling pictures focus on Greece’s Pomak minority and the women left behind by husbands who have emigrated to northern Europe for economic reasons. Vourloumis’s poignant series The Mermaid Madonna draws parallels between historically remote episodes of migration from Turkey to the island of Lesbos in the Aegean.Délio Jasse exhibits two bodies of work, Lost Chapter Nampula – 1963 and Nova Lisboa. Both combine documents salvaged from a Lisbon flea market with archival photographs of the family lives of Europeans in colonial Africa. Official stamps and lettering overlay and often obscure the monochromatic domestic scenarios.

Combine both at Mindil Beach Sunset Market, which buzzes with live music, crafts and food – all locally made. For the ultimate Mindil evening, Flight Centre’s Amber Farley recommends the market’s “Asian-inspired snacks and sorbets, then picnic at a film screening”. Feeling still more daring? Order a “roadkill burger”, made with kangaroo, buffalo or crocodile, before heading to the beach for a piña colada-coloured sunset.An Indigenous Australian art site with sweeping views over Arnhem Land, Ubirr is one of the most untouched and spiritually significant swathes of land in Australia. Visit the Rainbow Serpent – an Indigenous Australian creation story character believed to have painted her own image here as she snaked through the region – then climb to the site’s highest spot for a seductive sunrise and sunset views of Kakadu’s “stone country”. “The rolling plains look like they are glowing and the birdsong is hypnotic,” says Farley.Farther south, Kakadu’s dry land becomes a water-filled oasis, and Yellow Water billabong is a wildlife photographer’s dream. Lily pads float on its surface and paperbark trees rise up through its waters, as saltwater crocodiles bask on its banks and giant sea eagles and colourful kingfishers flit above it. Take a cruise with an Indigenous Australian guide in the early morning or evening to seek out the best snaps.Nitmiluk national park’s network of 13 gorges features soaring red and craggy cliffs rising above teal-toned waters. The freshwater crocodiles that lurk beneath are far less deadly than their salty cousins, making this a glorious canoeing spot. One tucked-away treasure you shouldn’t skip is the Southern Rockhole, an emerald-coloured waterfall-fed swimming hole. “Whether you are a first time traveller or a returning fan, this nature spot is one that keeps on giving,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.Wangi Falls, in Litchfield national park, robs many visitors of their breath. An arcing stretch of foliage-infused rock hosts two water streams that tumble from up to 85 metres into a glistening swimming hole. To reach the top, follow the walking trail, looping past trees loaded with flying foxes. “Take some meat, bread and utensils with you, and make use of the area’s BBQ facilities to extend your stay in this beautiful environment,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.A traditional Anangu dreaming site, this behemoth redheaded rock is taller than the Eiffel Tower and takes a cool three and a half hours to walk around. As the sun rises and falls over “The Rock”, the surfaces shift colours – from red and orange, through to maroon and purple – making Uluru a clear contender for Best Australian Backdrop, full stop.Ninety miles east of Uluru lies imposter rock “Fool-uru”. Travellers driving from Alice Springs often mistake this monolith – almost equal in size to Uluru – for the real deal. In fact, flat-topped Mount Conner is private property – so you’ll have to book a tour to visit – but those who do so will be rewarded with a lot more than a poor man’s Uluru. Conner’s striking horseshoe inselberg overlooks seven salt lakes and 1,500-head of cattle. “It’s a chance to step away from the crowds and learn about what this vast part of Australia can offer,” says Farley, who recommends rounding the visit off with a three-course home-cooked meal and a glass of fizz at the cattle station.Travellers with time for desert hopping would be mad to miss Kings Canyon, a sprawling wonderland of dome-like rocks, pink cliffs, abundant bird life and bursts of flora. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was filmed here, and the area was once entirely underwater, so keep your eyes peeled for stone paths imprinted with marine fossils. “The Garden of Eden”, a cycad-filled gully, is another highlight.A sacred site for the Indigenous Australian Arrernte women, this dramatic red corridor owes its existence to a tributary that once flowed through sandstone to meet the Finke River. Visit at midday for the best light – and venture beyond the chasm for views of the mountain ranges and a pretty walking path, lined with lush bushland.Picture-perfect swimming spot Ellery Creek Big Hole, 50 miles from Alice Springs, cuts through a gorge in the West MacDonnell Ranges. The scenery en route from Alice recalls the paintings of mid-century Indigenous Australian artist Albert Namatjira: expanses of ochre soil, soft green eucalyptus and skies ribbed in royal blue.With so many things to see, do and capture on camera, you might need a little help squeezing everything into your Aus adventure.

Young and devout Muslims standing in front of the Great Mosque and other locations around Old Mecca began posting self-portraits to Twitter. The hashtag #HajjSelfie went viral within hours.While most religious clerics adopted a diplomatic silence on the inevitable arrival of cameraphones during major religious gatherings, a handful of Muslim scholars spoke out. One Jeddah-based scholar said photography contravened the spirit of the hajj. “Taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our Prophet,” he said, with sincerity. An Islamic Studies teacher said worshippers were ruining their prayers by “humble-bragging”.Faith is a powerful force in the digital spaces that many believe to be agnostic. Islam, like Christianity, Judaism and other religions, thrives on social media. Videos related to religion are the second largest category on YouTube and content about Islam far exceeds that of other faiths. In 2012, more than 5,000 Islamic religious and lifestyle-themed videos were published on YouTube every week.Muslims can now access millions of judgments and fatwas – Islamic perspectives on everyday issues as mundane as the alcohol content of household cleaning products to sexual advice – in dozens of languages. Much of the most popular advice is good-humoured and targeted at digital natives. Increasingly, fatwas are issued by non-experts. Some imams are only half serious when they warn of the dangers of following unreliable advice from self-taught scholars described as “Sheikh Google”.Follow Me, Akhi, the debut book by journalist Hussein Kesvani, is a detailed and often witty journey through the online areas where Muslims congregate to ask one another for guidance or broach conversations about thorny issues. According to recent figures from the Office of National Statistics, there are around 3.4 million Muslims living in the UK, about half of whom are under the age of 24. Over a brisk 272 pages, Kesvani delivers a tableau of British Muslims wrestling with subjects ranging from clean eating and marriage to LGBT and gender rights.Just as the digital surges of the last two decades have brought opportunities in some areas of modern life, they have also unmoored Muslims from their neighbourhood mosques. Young British Muslims who once sat through mosque lectures from Pakistani or Bangladeshi imams reciting passages from the Qu’ran now communicate with self-taught liberal Muslim scholars such as Salmaan Saleem, a 48-year-old optician from Birmingham on YouTube channels such as Epic Islamic Lectures. Instead of learning only about prayer, young Muslims now discuss issues of piety and mental wellbeing. Readers who want to learn more about how Muslims organise online are recommended Hashtag Islam: How Cyber-Islamic Environments are Transforming Religious Authority by Gary R Bunt.In his travels around the UK, Kesvani gives three dimensions to a number of characters, including Abu Antaar, a religious zealot and Arsenal fan who left Britain to join Isis in Syria. Follow Me, Akhi contains some thoughtful accounts of extremism, but focuses more on how Muslims have found areas online where counter-radicalisation prospers.Some of the most illuminating research concerns universal aspects of everyday life. Kesvani interviews Muslim women like Saira who use marriage apps like Muzmatch and Instapoets such as British-Somalian Abdi, who combine messages from the Qur’an with the black politics of rappers KRS-One and Rakim. He also interviews Muslims who have joined alt-right online movements.One area where digitalism has had a knock-on effect in the opinions of Muslims is in conversations about gender roles. Muslim women have responded to sexist behaviour with websites such as Side Entrance, which juxtaposes photographs of extravagant prayer spaces reserved for men with the usually dismal basements set aside for women. In 2018, women used #MosqueMeToo to share stories of sexual assault and abuse in places of worship. Kesvani also writes about how once taboo subjects like abortion are discussed on Tumblr.More than 15 years after the launch of Facebook, even technologists now fear that digital platforms are radicalising attitudes to women and minority groups. While many of those concerns will remain true, Follow Me, Akhi provides an enthusiastic demonstration of how religion and digital democracy can coexist in the pursuit of an informed and liberal ideology.• Follow Me, Akhi: The Online World of British Muslims by Hussein Kesvani is published by Hurst (£12.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.A foundational work to start with. Aeschylus’ Oresteia has awed paulburns:I’m a bit overwhelmed by its brilliance, even though I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve read it. Translated by Robert Fagles, one marvels at its poetic grandeur and religious ritual, especially in Agamemnon, the first play of the cycle, Though that reaches a dramatic height with Agamemnon’s murder by Clytemnestra. The second play, The Libation Bearers, where Orestes decides to murder his mother in revenge for her murder of Agamemnon, moves more quickly, and, to my mind, reads better. The final play, The Eumenides, is the most frightening. Legend has it that the dance and chant where the Furies called down revenge on Orestes had women fainting in the audience. (I’d bet the men were shivering in their boots as well.) There was nothing to match it in world literature until Shakespeare wrote the witches’ scenes in Macbeth.Wow, I’m still a little discombobulated with that one, which is rarely a bad sign. The book didn’t really go at all how I expected it to. The direction of the narrative set in the first 50 or so pages preordained a certain finish, but the end was not what I had foreseen. Those closing pages really just knocked me on my ass ever so slightly.Millingabout is “deep into” Jerusalem by Alan Moore:It is apparently one of the longest novels ever written, which explains the tissue thin papers and small text. My god, is it good. Part anthropological dig into the residents of “The Boroughs” of Northampton, part historical fiction, part fantasy, and a deep delve into life, death and the afterlife that serves as the veins of the story. Jerusalem blends real life and fiction perfectly, it truly is Moore’s magnum opus. Out of all of the fascinating, mad, dark tales the author has given us, truly this is a story to rival Chaucer’s Tales. It feels like the type of story that should be broken up into parts and retold as folk tales for centuries to come. Highly recommended.An unusual experience for CCCubbon, when dipping into The World Turned Upside Down by Christopher Hill:This morning I dug out Hill’s excellent book on the radical ideas of groups such as Levellers, Seekers, Ranters, Diggers and Fifth Modernists, sects like Quakers, Baptists and Muggletonians … But here’s the strangest thing. Something I had not noticed before. This paperback was published by Penguin in 1991. I must have picked it up in some secondhand bookshop one day and I wanted to look up a reference to Sir Isaac Newton and his belief in alchemy, page 290, when I noticed that page 288 had a different typeface. Checking further, all the pages from 240 were in the same different typeface, in fact, after 240 the page number was 129. How odd. Investigating further, I discovered that a section from a different book was included (129-160) this is from Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins. Pages 240-288 of Hill’s book missing. I have never come across such a thing before and wonder if every 1991 edition has the same error?“I have read Old Filth by Jane Gardam,” says lonelybloomer “and I’m in love”:It is exactly the book I was looking for. What a treat to find there are two more in the trilogy! Feeling positively energised and happy with my reading habit.ChronicExpat has just finished The Hanged Man of Saint-Pholien by Georges Simenon (translated by Linda Coverdale):My, what a strange, surreal little book it is! As I read, I couldn’t help envisioning it as a black-and-white New Wave film, filled with shadowy lighting, rapid scene changes and long tracking shots… I am enjoying my initial forays into the world of Maigret very much. Given how many of them there are, of course, I shall have to pick up the pace if I intend to get through all of them: there are 73 novels left (not to mention the short stories) which, at my current rate of three a year, will take me another 24 years to get through … and I rather think I’ll be lucky to live that long.This week every year I take Ulysses down from the shelf and read three or four pages from each of the 18 chapters. It’s a ritual I enjoy more with each passing year and my admiration for Joyce’s masterpiece grows accordingly. Such a wonderful affirmation of words, of language, and ultimately, of our humanity. It is a novel that has never been bettered and I will be forever grateful to Joyce for completing it and to Sylvia Beach for publishing it.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

She said for every five scripts sent to her by a man, she would receive just one by a woman.“Too often the writing room is not sensitively run. It can be aggressive and slightly bullying,” Schuster told Diverse Festival on Monday, according to the BBC, where she featured in a panel discussion titled “why employing more women writers in comedy matters”.After consulting writers, producers, agents and performers, Schuster, whose commissions include Benidorm and CelebAbility, said she changed her terms of commission and refused any offering written exclusively by men.“I won’t commission anything with an all-male writing team.”Writer Brona C Titley, who works on Celebability, told the festival: “If you have the same type of writers in terms of race or sexual orientation or gender, then you’re only getting one kind of joke.”Schuster has pushed for equality in comedy writing for years in her role in ITV. She founded the initiative Comedy 50:50 in February 2018 after becoming inspired by an event about gender equality in the industry at Bafta and realising that “as the comedy commissioner at ITV, it’s up to me to drive the narrative”.She discovered female writers were often at a disadvantage because men usually already had more writing credits, because it was hard to find producers who “get” their voices and develop their scripts and the fact that “female writers often don’t thrive as the lone female voice in the writing room”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30e04af3172421dd5b7241e630c93ac3edfe108/0_125_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d528a64cef8ad9c55fb0e5b1c54883","title":"european car sales facebook cryptocurrency business live","story":"The US President says Draghi’s plans will weaken the euro putting the US at a competitive disadvantage Donald Trump is not happy about Mario Draghi’s suggestion that the ECB will cut eurozone rates. Specifically, he says the resulting drop in the euro puts the US at a disadvantage:Bart Hordijk, a currency analyst at Monex Europe, says that markets are now firmly expecting a rate cut after Mario Draghi’s comments this morning in Sintra:The rate cutting genie is out of the bottle for the European Central Bank after Mario Draghi this morning mentioned that further cuts in the policy rate remain part of ECB’s toolkit. A full ECB rate cut is now priced in by futures markets for 2019 after Draghi showed his concerns about the persistently low inflation in the eurozone and the lingering risks to growth. Also, the ECB President mentioned there is “considerable headroom” regarding the asset purchase programme, indicating the ECB armoury is far from exhausted.The euro has fallen after Mario Draghi signalled that the European Central Bank is ready to pump fresh stimulus into the eurozone economy, with more rate cuts andor bond purchases.The whitepaper on Libra says it will be built on the foundation of blockchain technology, and outlines just how ambitious the plans are: People will be able to send, receive, spend, and secure their money, enabling a more inclusive global financial system.The aim is to make Libra as widely accepted and as easy to use as possible to create a currency that people can use with confidence and convenience in their everyday lives.Backers include PayPal, Spotify, Uber, Lyft, Ebay, Visa and Vodafone.When Libra is launched, users will be able to download Calibra, a digital wallet that will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.Here is our Q\u0026ampA on what we can expect from Facebook’s ambitious move into cryptocurrencies:Here is our full story on Facebook’s Libra launch:Breaking: Facebook has announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency in 2020.The currency will be named Libra and will allow the social media site’s billions of users to make financial transactions around the world.It marks a major strategic shift for Facebook, as it seeks to expand beyond social networking and into e-commerce and global payments.European markets are making notable gains - reversing earlier falls - after Mario Draghi hinted that more interest rate cuts and bond purchases could be on the horizon.Neil Wilson, analyst at markets, says the central bank governor is now in “full dove mode”. The towel has been thrown in. Building on the last ECB meeting, at which some members discussed reopening quantitative easing, this looks like a clear signal that the central bank is preparing markets to expect monetary policy to become more accommodative this year.Mario Draghi has raised expectations that the European Central Bank will pump more stimulus into the eurozone economy.Speaking in Sintra at the ECB’s forum on central banking, Draghi said the door was still open to rate cuts andor further bond purchases:Further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools. And the APP (asset purchase program) still has considerable headroom.If the crisis has shown anything, it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate — and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future.Read his full speech here.European markets are mixed this morning. Heathrow has published details of its controversial plans for a third runway, which include lowering part of the M25 so that the runway can cross it, rerouting rivers and relocating huge car parks. The publication marks the beginning of a 12-week public consultation on the plans, which are opposed by climate campaigners who warn of the damaging impact that 700 extra planes will have when the runway is due to open in 2026.Read our full story here:One major opponent to the Heathrow expansion plans is Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and favourite to be the UK’s next prime minister. On his return to parliament in 2015, he vowed that if it came to it, he would lie “in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway”.On day two of the Paris air show, Bloomberg gives a handy summary of some of the key themes:Here is how the European car industry has fared in recent months:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.It was hardly a major leap in demand but will be encouraging nonetheless for an industry under serious pressure from a tough consumer backdrop, tighter emissions rules, and the challenges posed by the shift to electric cars and driverless technology.Facebook is expected to say it is launching its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.

We explored in depth whether next year’s Olympics can live up to the 1964 games, how Tokyo is bracing itself for its next once-in-a century earthquake, and how life is changing for women in the city.We asked you for your thoughts on how the city’s changed, and for your comments on our coverage.Here’s what you told us:In response to our report by the ’s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, on whether the city is opening up to the outside world, Lou, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years, said:Tokyo is changing, but not for the better. Many old, beautiful traditions are dying out. Young people aren’t upholding them. English is infiltrating and the result is not good – the Japanese language is chock full of random, annoying English words.Mass immigration will be the nail in the coffin. Japan will be ‘globalised’ and its traditions relegated to tourist spots. Why do we want Tokyo to be like London? What is so great about Tokyo ‘finally opening up’? The whole world is becoming a homogenous lump. Where will the tourists go then?”On social media we asked readers to share their hopes and fears for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. @kakiandbambino said he hoped no-one - players, staff or spectators – dies due to heatstroke.’s athetics correspondent, Sean Ingle, reported from the city on whether Tokyo 2020 can live up to 1964’s Olympic legacy: “Such was the event’s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020.”Toby Miller got in touch to highlight the darker side of those games. He said the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was “an environmental and human, classic Cold-War disaster”. Miller, author of Greenwashing Sport, describes environment destruction caused by the construction of the high-speed rail link between Osaka and Tokyo.The canals, sea, and rivers below the railway were inundated with concrete and landfill, and a centuries-old field of seaweed destroyed. Water stagnated, sludge emerged, and sea life perished. Estuaries turned into cesspools andor were transformed into roads. The tramway system was virtually destroyed in favor of freeways and cars became dominant. Clearance of living things saw hundreds of thousands of homeless cats and dogs killed by the state. As with all very rapid, massive modernizations, from the US through the Soviet Union to China, this transformation was achieved through violence in this case, the horror of war and its detritus, followed by preferential Cold-War terms.”Mid-week a curious email landed in our inbox. The subject line was “Tokyo’s Floating Stadium”, and it was sent from Florian Busch Architects, in Shibuya-ku. It announced:After several plans to build a new National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo had been cancelled, the embarrassment was redeemed by an almost happy ending. In July of 2020, the New National Stadium, a ship, anchored under Odaiba’s Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo became the first host of an era of a newfound Olympic spirit.”This “floating stadium” was a groundbreaking architectural feat that would travel the world, from one Olympic city to the next.It also wasn’t real, but in fact an elaborate tease devised by the architect firm “in response to the mess surrounding the Olympic stadium”.We asked readers to share their thoughts about how Tokyo was changing. Laurence Williams, associate professor in the Faculty of Foreign Studies at Sophia University, a private university in Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo, said:Japanese academia is much more open to non-Japanese professors than it used to be. Tokyo itself is erse and exciting and this is a great time to be working in the city. Numbers of international students are rising sharply (because of demographic decline, universities are increasingly looking abroad). Most international students are still from elsewhere in Asia, although USUKEurope numbers are rising.”Susannah, who lives in Shibuya, sent in this photo of the Imperial Palace from across the water, and writes: “This is just after New Years, and shows an impressive contrast between nature, old Japan, and new Japan.”David Chart wrote in to say that he served on Kawasaki City committees dealing with issues affecting foreign residents, and reckons the treatment of them hasn’t changed. A couple of years ago he helped organise a survey of foreign residents living in Kawasaki to find out problems they were facing. In a blogpost at the time about the survey results, he said the Japanese police occasionally single out foreigners due to their race, and ask them questions, and “sometimes they make them call their mothers”. He told  Cities: “The composition of the foreign population has changed a lot even while I have been here, but the problems they face have changed much less. Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way.On Tuesday we published an investigation by  Cities and the Waseda Chronicle into how Tokyo’s suburban housing became vast ghettoes for elderly people. Reader Lewis Parley wrote in to say:Your article about the aging population of Tokyo’s suburban housing estates was very informative. I think it would be beneficial to the series if you contrast this phenomenon with the renaissance some more central public housing estates are experiencing due to the influx of immigrant families ( Chinese in Kawaguchi, Indian Bangladeshi in Ojima, Koto-ku and Kasai, Edogawa-ku). By also featuring these places, I think you’d give the reader a more balanced picture of the changes Tokyo’s population is experiencing.”During the week, people shared photos of their favourite and suprising Tokyo scenes on Twitter and Instagram, such as these posts:Trevor Skingle got in touch to describe the tension he’d observed between modernisation, and the desire to preserve the city’s heritage.Take for instance the old ‘Habutae Dango’ that was located near Nippori Station with its 200-year-old history as a tea house and dango (sweet dumpling shop), a favourite haunt of the poet Masaoka Shiki and the author Natsume Soseki, and repository of a few Shogitai relics from the 1868 Battle of Ueno. Each time I visited Tokyo I would make a point of visiting to enjoy their dango and matcha green tea whilst at the same time contemplating the wonderful garden view available only to patrons only to find on my visit in 2018 that it had become a building site.”On the other hand, he adds: “As a Tokyo history buff I am astonished at some of the historical finds that I’ve made which are still there.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

I never thought parliament would tell me to choose between being an MP and being a mum. My Labour colleague Tulip Siddiq was forced to postpone a C-section so she could cast a vote in the debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal in January and that caused a rightful outcry. Westminster can – when it wants – make it possible to combine parenthood with legislating and Siddiq’s push for progress on a system that would have allowed her to vote by proxy demonstrates it. But allowing an MP to nominate someone to vote on their behalf when they need to be at home with their children is just one piece of a much bigger equality puzzle.During my first miscarriage, aching and bleeding, I joined a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. The day after I found out that another baby’s heartbeat had stopped, I led a public meeting on gang crime. I even scheduled the procedure to remove the body on a day I didn’t have a constituency advice surgery. Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected.Now I’m pregnant once more and terrified – not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible. I’m coming forward publicly to talk about it because, as for far too many women, the personal inevitably becomes political when reproduction is involved.The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) is the independent body that since 2009 has, on behalf of taxpayers, regulated the pay of MPs and authorised the budgets we claim for our work. Ipsa has a duty to ensure that we are resourced appropriately to carry out parliamentary duties. But it says it does not “recognise” that MPs go on maternity leave. Thus, it feels no responsibility to make provision for any paid cover for what we do outside the parliamentary chamber: the campaigns, constituency casework and municipal work that all MPs do. Harriet Harman wrote movingly of trying to cover constituency duties with babies in tow in the 1980s. Despite warm words about maternity cover two years ago from Ipsa, things have gone backwards. Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding – or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don’t miss out. If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of community services. In Denmark a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed. My experience is not unique. Other MPs who have had children since Ipsa was created have told me of the same rejection of their requests for help on the basis that MPs “do not take maternity leave”. Siddiq herself had to return to doing casework three days after a C-section. Some MPs have tried to be with their newborn child at least for a few weeks, hoping residents don’t notice their absence and the correspondence doesn’t pile up too much, or begging colleagues to cover casework. Several have ended up taking their children with them to meetings so they can feed them, with constituents acting as proxy babysitters while trying to talk to their representative.No community should miss out on representation because its MP is pregnant – nor should my opponents be able to argue there’s a cost to my constituents because I may succeed in my quest to conceive. For all the talk of being family friendly, Westminster is still struggling to offer deeds instead of words. And if we can’t get this right for MPs, how can we get this right for parents elsewhere?Britain still has a long way to go to ensure that fertility isn’t a barrier to equality. A third of employers think it’s acceptable to ask women about their plans for having a family at a job interview. Non-disclosure agreements are used frequently to cover up pregnancy discrimination, with the legal advice service Pregnant Then Screwed receiving on average 350 calls a year. This inequality isn’t just in the workplace. Fertility treatment is a minefield in terms of access and quality, leading many to go abroad. If thousands of Brits went overseas for experimental optometry, it would be a national priority to ensure no one returned blind. But women are left to congregate in online chatrooms to share IVF reviews and pricing plans, as a commercial industry supplants public provision in a way we wouldn’t accept with any other branch of healthcare.Increasingly, our bodies are the battlefield of political change. We need to bring together the fight for the right to reproduce and the right not to do so – not least because in these Trump-inspired times those who seek to control women find it politically expedient. In Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana I would potentially have faced a criminal investigation to ensure I had not caused my own miscarriages because they were later than their six-week abortion deadline. Our own government forces women to continue unwanted pregnancies by retaining an outright ban on abortion in Northern Ireland.Prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives – whether we have children or not – in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts. For my work on abortion rights I have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my “desire to kill other people’s babies”.Campaigners opposed to providing LGBT sex and relationship education in schools once surrounded me in my constituency screaming that I didn’t have children of my own, so how could I understand their concerns. My political opponents have printed campaign leaflets highlighting their candidates’ motherhood and marriage to demonstrate how I was deficient. When I talk to male colleagues – whether fathers or not – none of this behaviour even rings a bell.Achieving a world in which women are not discriminated against because they can carry children means challenging all of these attitudes – and the policies that go with them. From the parliamentary authorities to our healthcare services and workplaces, it’s time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with. It is time to refuse to wait patiently and instead to make it a a priority. As a politician I’ve never stopped fighting for women to have control over their own bodies through the provision of reproductive rights and services as the non-negotiable prerequisite of equality. As a pregnant woman this recent experience is another bitter reminder that it’s still often men – this time the Ipsa executives – who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won.• Stella Creasy is the Labour and Co-operative MP for Walthamstow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f0bd134e1f480fc47079a98a553f9f5c568d/81_288_4509_2705/master/4509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4451a2a99b384a7a61d1f5a1d8ccc59c","title":"theresa may brexit referendum","story":"The obscene sight of Tory leadership candidates splashing out cash by the bucketload is just one of the head-clutching, this-can’t-be-happening unbelievables of this extraordinary time. Spaffing it up the wall doesn’t begin to express the revolting spectacle of wild tax cuts and eye-catching gimmicks from the same austerians who garrotted every public service. Theresa May is the biggest spender, spraying goodbye billions on mental health, schools, colleges and a zero-carbon pledge, while Philip Hammond’s Treasury declares it “immoral” to steal from the emergency no-deal fund. What does she care? She is taking her revenge on them all.But if May wants revenge, she has the power to blow away all her obstructors, tormentors and detractors, all 80 European Research Groupers, all those who blocked her deal. Who knows the dark recesses of her mind, this locked-in woman incapable of communication? Although the Mail on Sunday report on her has a ring of plausibility. She will keep her Commons seat, she voted for Rory Stewart and she “privately vowed to thwart any attempt by Boris Johnson to take the UK out of the EU without a deal”. (Never mind that her mantra was “no deal is better than a bad deal”.)Soon Johnson will be strapped into her straitjacket, his phantom pregnancy of a new deal over. Nigel Farage and the ERG leer threateningly as the no-deal abyss beckons, with the pandemonium of border blockages, shortages of fuel, food and medicines and an Irish border shutdown.Parliament will prevent it, one way or another: the Speaker, John Bercow, guarantees it. Only 10 brave Tory MPs voted for Jeremy Corbyn’s motion last week to block no deal. But in October, on the brink of no deal, when Labour calls a vote of no confidence to bring down the Johnson government, many more Tories will join them – the likes of Philip Hammond, David Gauke, Amber Rudd and others now in government including, it is suggested, May herself, will bring the final curtain down on their own party. Justine Greening, one of the brave, reckons as many as 50 would do the deed. Dominic Grieve says it would only need about six, and he has those. A question hangs over the disgraceful 21 Labour MPs who voted or abstained to permit no deal last week: surely they would vote no confidence in Johnson?May, looking for a legacy before her 24 July departure, must be asking herself this: if she would bring down a Tory government to save her country, why not take action sooner? She has the power. She could press the nuclear option and revoke article 50, ending the Brexit trauma at a stroke: quite a legacy.But the outrage would be terrifying, with leavers now more furious at denial of their democratic vote than about leaving the EU. So instead she could put her own referendum bill before parliament. Greening suggests a ranking of three preferences – no deal, May’s deal, or remain. May can say with conviction that too much is being decided behind closed doors by a tiny Tory electorate: democracy demands the people, not the Tory party, decide what comes next. She would, the Tory rebels think, get it through parliament quite easily, forcing the winner of this leadership charade to give the people the final say. That might even be a relief.Remainers might well lose the referendum – people might choose no deal. But so be it, they will at least know the price. Last time, no deal was never even mentioned.Johnson could grab the initiative, calling a snap election in full victory bounce before his unicorn Brexit plan is exposed, before Farage can claim “betrayal”. But how much better if May obliged him to call a referendum too. Tories are selecting him as their best hope to stop votes leaching to Farage, but analyst of Tory fortunes Tim Bale warns that he may not do well with the rest of the electorate. The “Boris brand” – Heineken man, who used to reach across party ides – morphed when he turned hard Brexiteer in 2016 – anti-immigration, lying about 80 million Turks and fibbing on NHS funds. Now he reaches mainly his own kind, and Farage will be warning that Johnson can never be trusted, and only the Brexit party will keep him straight. That fear has started Tory donors in secret talks for a Tory-Farage electoral pact, claims the : Tories would stand aside for Brexit candidates in northern towns.That should frighten the life out of Labour: the Tory-Brexit party split is Labour’s route to power. At a crucial shadow cabinet meeting tomorrow, Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Andy McDonald, Emily Thornberry and many others will press hard for Labour to get off the fence, with full-throated backing for a referendum and remain. Skewered in recent elections for facing both ways, Labour needs to interrupt this Tory leadership parade of Brexiteers. The absence of the opposition making the remain case has left a gaping democratic deficit.Could Corbyn pivot at this point? Easily, say shadow cabinet remainers, because there is no chance for a Labour-negotiated Brexit now: the only place to be is strongly pro-Europe. Labour members and voters are tearing their hair out at the party’s empty chair as the nation’s fate is decided by a handful of Tories.If Johnson and Farage did make a pact, then in this Brexit crisis Labour must ally with Greens, Lib Dems and independents, promising electoral reform so it never need be done again. Sharing out seats is agonising – but this would be a national emergency to save the country from a Farage-Johnson no-deal government. The country will never have needed Labour more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39b510921091cd8c1abca308874190ae51ba59a/139_176_2053_1232/master/2053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f35c6e492207af5d7e42ed2d1c880be3","title":"bbc licence fee over 75 free","story":"The debate around the BBC’s decision to restrict the provision of free TV licences to over-75s seems to bear all the hallmarks of the usual BBC bashing – from a section of the press that usually speaks up proudly for uniquely British endeavours. There couldn’t, by any chance, be some financial self-interest behind the attempts to lay this much-admired British institution low, could there?Politicians – not programme-makers – made the decision to offer free TV licences to over-75s, paid for out of general taxation. In 2015, it was again politicians who, for short-term financial reasons, decided not to abandon this commitment but to hand it over to the BBC, to be paid for out of licence fee income. Faced with the loss of £750m from its budget – a fifth of its licence fee income – what choice did the BBC have?It could have abolished the free licences altogether, a decision that would have been very harsh on the poorest pensioners – the very people who rely most heavily on the BBC’s services. It could have accepted the cut. Taking £750m out of the BBC’s budget would have meant the closure of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5 Live and a number of local radio stations, as well as other cuts and reductions. Instead it decided to limit the free licence fees to the poorest pensioners – those least able to pay it themselves.This was a decision forced on the BBC. It was action dictated by a government intent on shifting the blame for what was likely to be a deeply unpopular cut to another public institution. Between a rock and a hard place, the BBC took probably the only action it could. Public service broadcasting as we know it would have been changed for ever had it done otherwise.Film and television bring over £8bn in revenue annually into the Treasury. But in a world increasingly dominated by the US media giants, there will be cultural as well as economic consequences if we allow our public service broadcasters to be diminished. Already the BBC and other public service broadcasters are starting to rely on international co-productions to bring ideas to the screen. And yet streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have made no secret of their wish to eventually withdraw from these co-productions and finance the shows themselves, “buying up” British creative talent for their brand of “global television” – often set in some mythical mid-Atlantic state where characters dress, talk and think like Americans.The ability to tell uniquely British stories, to hold a mirror up to life as it is lived in this country, remains hugely popular in the UK – and is central to our concept of public service broadcasting. That concept is almost 100 years old, and is admired all over the world. Hacking one-fifth out of the BBC’s licence fee income would have cut the heart out of it.Outstanding programmes of recent years simply would not have been made. Dramas such as the powerful Three Girls, the sexual abuse drama set in Rochdale, which swept the board at the Baftas and had an audience of 8.1 million factual programmes such as Climate Change: The Facts and Blue Planet II comedies such as This Country, Inside No 9 and Back to Life. And drama adaptations like my own Wolf Hall – which was disproportionately popular with older audiences.It’s strange to me how ready the rightwing press is to leap to the defence of the elderly when doing so presents another opportunity to bash the BBC. I wish it was similarly quick to anger when social care provision is slashed or hospital waiting targets missed, both far more damaging to the elderly poor for whom they now cry their crocodile tears.The licence fee costs less than £3 a week. For that you get all the BBC TV channels, all of BBC radio – so valued by the housebound elderly – and all the catch-up services. And if you are poor and over 75, it will still be free. Given the Gordian knot with which the BBC has been presented, I don’t think this is such a bad solution.• Peter Kosminsky is a British writer, director and producer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30f8d9468c50022feb393cfc0aa296da6bc3d6a/0_220_4324_2594/master/4324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7d017541781fd7c1cdd8f5162c31fd","title":"labour brexit remain","story":"With the Conservatives ready to seal an electoral pact with Nigel Farage, British politics has become a battle of cultures and beliefs. At the same time, as Labour’s shadow cabinet was forced to accept last week, we are now seeing a four-way fragmentation of the party system.As a result, at some time between now and its September conference, the Labour party is likely to commit unconditionally to a remainreform position on Europe. Whether via a second referendum, or – which looks more likely – a snap election, Labour’s task is to become the leading force within a progressive majority that wants to stop no deal, defend parliamentary democracy and halt the Trumpification of politics.But it won’t be easy. A significant number of pro-Corbyn activists have convinced themselves that the demand for a second referendum is simply a weapon invented by Blairites to destroy the leader. Meanwhile, among a group of Labour MPs in former industrial constituencies and their voters and activists, there is no appetite for a second referendum that could sour an already bitter political atmosphere in their communities.But the change must happen, and those like me, who have advocated it, have the duty to explain the risks, the penalties, and how they could be overcome.Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to deflect the cultural polarisation around Brexit by pulling voters towards a radical economic agenda was admirable – but it has failed.It will no longer work while the Brexit issue dominates the debate. For every voter Labour is currently losing to Farage, it loses four to the Greens, Liberal Democrats or left nationalist parties. That was the evidence presented to the shadow cabinet.Those within the Labour hierarchy still resisting change suggest that, if it flips now to remain, the party will test the loyalty of the so-called Labour leave voters, who have stuck with the party on the grounds that it “respects the referendum result”. Meanwhile, because remain votes pile up in big cities, even if it claws many remainers back, that’s not enough to compensate in the crucial marginal seats.I have to admit this risk is real. But let’s consider the alternatives. If the incoming Tory leader tries, yet again, to put the old withdrawal agreement to parliament before 31 October, and if Labour was prepared to offer a free vote to MPs such as Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy, a softish Brexit might be achieved, and two-party politics (in England at least) might reappear.The problem is, for the Labour MPs who want to vote for a deal, a free vote is not enough. They need Labour to be able to “take the credit” for sorting Brexit out. But what looks like credit in Wigan looks like blame in Bristol, so there is no chance of persuading Labour’s leaders to put their fingerprints on a deal. Another alternative would be for Labour to begin a long summer “listening exercise”, letting its remain wing – Starmer, Watson, the Welsh and Scottish Labour parties and the Love Socialism Hate Brexit group – do its own thing while Corbyn’s inner team focuses on avoiding the issue.That would ensure the September party conference was a bloodbath. The only way the membership could be stopped from overturning the present line would be if an army of union bureaucrats were deployed to neutralise conference democracy. The incoming Tory leader would get two months to set the agenda, with no parliament to worry about and Labour absorbed in an argument with itself.The only realistic course of action is for Corbyn to come out, fast and strong, with a call to stop the Brexit chaos and rebuild Britain instead. Any advisers and shadow ministers who cannot sell the new position enthusiastically need to step back so that others can.Labour has to demonstrate that it understands the situation has changed. It could say: “We tried to stop a ide opening among the British electorate, because leave and remain voters have more in common than what ides them. But we failed – and now we face a battle for the soul of Britain.” In that fight, there is only one side we can be on: with those fighting for an open, tolerant and globally connected country, against bigotry and a power grab by the rightwing elite.But the most vital task is to reframe Labour’s offer to voters in leave-supporting areas. Polling shows that the most salient issue for these voters, after Brexit, is the NHS, followed closely by the economy and immigration.Framing a no-deal Brexit as a threat to the future of state-funded healthcare should be easy, since President Trump, in one brainless soundbite, provided ammunition that will haunt the Tories at election time. Whether it’s Hunt, Gove or Johnson, the blunt question – will you rule out American ownership of our NHS hospitals after Brexit? – could be a killer one.On the economy, the catastrophes at Ford Bridgend, British Steel in Scunthorpe and Honda Swindon should be made the centrepiece of an argument that only Labour, by halting the slide to no deal, can save what’s left of British industry. Alongside that, Labour must start turning its commitments on industrial strategy into concrete, local offers. The plan for a national investment bank, for instance, needs to be translated down to constituency level: Wigan, Sunderland and Stoke-on-Trent will get so many billion pounds each over five years, and we’re calling a local summit to ask what you want it spent on.Finally, on immigration, Labour should commit overtly to the reform of freedom of movement once article 50 is revoked. Fair application of the existing rules could include strong regulations to prevent migrant-only hiring practices, a big migrant impact fund, plus the introduction of time limits for European citizens who do not find work in Britain, such as exists in Denmark.If Labour makes this change, then for a few diehard Lexiteers it will feel, for a few days, as if their heads just exploded. But realigning Labour to the priorities of the progressive majority of British voters is obligatory.We have only months to prevent the permanent fragmentation of politics. Labour is not only susceptible to its middle-class vote bleeding to the Lib Dems, but its left and youthful vote switching to the Greens. It is unlikely Labour will remain immune to the “green wave” sweeping Europe for much longer.Strategically, Corbynism was the answer to a problem that was clear four years ago: Labour’s failure to fight austerity and war. Now the problem has changed, so the strategy has to change.We have to give progressive voters a reason to come back to Labour – and urgently, before the habit of voting for others sets in.Given the scale of the xenophobic swing on the right of British politics, an alliance of the left and the centre against Brexit is inevitable. The only questions remaining are who will set the terms of that alliance, who will inspire it, who will lead it – and who will own its success?• Paul Mason is a writer and broadcaster on economics and social justice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2b11e61716da8ea6ce0e7d4342b14513879e16/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6835c759d181517e8698136bbd8e362e","title":"ruthless exam system where bereavement barely matters alevel gcse","story":"Even if A-level or GCSE students have lost a parent, their future depends on being poised to perform on a random dayYet, despite this evidence, there is no official support for children who suffer bereavement. At secondary school, most teachers have no idea if a child has lost a parent – and there’s not much they can do if they have. As a sixth-form manager I remember giving one pupil a hard time about her grades, when she noted that her mum had died the year before. “Can’t you give me a break?” she shouted. The answer, sadly, was no. Six months later she would leave our school. I couldn’t bring her mum back but what I could do was push her to get into university, which would help her get the graduate job she wanted, and the life she craved.She had one shot. Almost no one gets to resit their GCSEs, other than English and maths, and A-level resits have patchy availability. We’ve in effect constructed a system that relies on young people being perfectly poised in the summers when they are 16 and 18, to give their best performance. In the past, a setback could be overcome through night school or the Open University, but with these options now more limited and more expensive, not being ready on a random day in June is potentially disastrous.People looking for easy answers might call for the scrapping of GCSEs, or the resurrection of modular exams. Frankly, I don’t think either solution helps. But I do wish exam boards would create ways to bump up results. Universities offer immediate resits each summer, why not for GCSEs and A-levels? Or allow people to continue resitting exams as they get older? If exams were online, each candidate could receive questions relating to the syllabus they studied and have them auto-marked. If you’re doing better at history by age 21, why not have this reflected in updated scores?Ultimately, it would take imagination to implement these ideas, but it seems a kinder, more positive solution than the current algorithms of despair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e6c878d362a92f249a544bb275073fe5fad242/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b07d3f999354182993748b3fa5d984d","title":"epic photo huntsman spider eats pygmy possum in tasmania","story":"It’s a ‘fairly rare’ event, arachnology expert says, as it’s more common to see huntsman eat small birds or frogs.

Then somebody had a great idea to save it – make it the greenest place on EarthBut the town has come up with an answer: recycling. Far from the Scandinavian stereotype of glossy modernity, Eskilstuna’s wide-paved, near-deserted grey streets are populated by kitsch 1980s pizzerias, workers’ cafes and gloomy pubs – not a place where you would expect to find such a radical approach to the environment. Yet since 2012, Eskilstuna has implemented a spate of green initiatives, vying to make it the most environmentally friendly city in Sweden – and perhaps the world. Public buses and cars are run on biogas and electricity, and the town uses low-carbon combined heat and power plants, which use the thermal energy from electricity production to heat water. Residents sort their waste into seven multicoloured categories at home – green for food, pink for textiles, grey for metal, yellow for paper, blue for newspaper, orange for plastic and black for mixed – and for the past four years people have been able to drop off their unwanted goods for recycling at Bergström’s secondhand mall.Bergström moved to Eskilstuna in 2012, after becoming disillusioned with the huge waste she encountered during her career in commercial fashion, to run ReTuna (Tuna is the town’s nickname). She says the idea startled people to begin with. “When I first came here, no one knew about the mall. And when they did, no one liked it,” she says. “In a town like this, which has suffered, people are suspicious of change, especially something as radical as a shopping mall where all the goods are donated by the people of the town and then resold to them.”Yet, since the recycling scheme began and ReTuna opened it has been a success, resulting in no domestic waste going to landfill, and potentially providing a second lease of life for the steel city. Despite being a 20-minute drive from the town centre on a Wednesday morning, ReTuna is full of shoppers roaming through secondhand stores, looking at everything from furniture to children’s toys, flowers and clothes. The mall is situated in an unassuming warehouse building in the middle of a field, next to one of the town’s two recycling centres. Residents drop off their goods to be sorted by the 12 staff on hand in the cavernous warehouse beneath the shop floors. Standing in ReTuna’s entrance hall beneath a tree fashioned from recycled cups, Bergström explains how she won over the town. “Everyone’s minds began to change the day we opened,” she says. “Six thousand people came to visit that day, and since then we average 700 visitors a day and 300 tour groups a year.”The daily tour groups – which are made up mainly of students – shows how innovative Eskilstuna’s recycling schemes are. Today’s tour, for instance, is part of an exchange between Indian students from a college in Pune and a local Swedish media school. The teacher from Pune, Sonia Khambete, organised the trip after she heard about ReTuna on social media. “This is a very inspiring place,” she says. “In India, we have a huge waste management problem where, as the population grows, we increasingly live in a throwaway culture. We brought our students here because we could all learn a lot from a place like ReTuna.”Mother-and-daughter shoppers Sandra and Elisabeth Jarvinen agree. “We have lived in Eskilstuna our whole lives,” Sandra says, “and ReTuna has revitalised the town, it’s something for us to be proud of.”Bjorn Gutenberg, who lives 30 miles (50km) outside ReTuna, but comes to shop here at least once a week, says: “We’re actually addressing the problem. It creates job opportunities, and it’s great for people to see the whole chain of recycling and consumption.” Shoppers come from even further afield, too, says Bergström who adds that families have visited from France, Japan and even Australia.ReTuna is owned by Eskilstuna’s energy board, which is run by the city municipality, the Swedish version of a local council. To get the project started, the municipality invested 19.5m Swedish kronor (£1.6m) for building works, but also to subsidise rates for the shop owners. In 2018, for the first time, the mall operated without this subsidy and it broke even, but Bergström knows revenues need to increase to keep the business running. “We need to make more money to be able to hire people because the shop owners work really hard seven days a week.”Larsson, like the other shop owners, has to address the problem of how to price products they have received for nothing – while still making a profit and paying the costs of running their shops. “People assume our products should be cheap, but it’s really hard to price what we do,” she says. “Eskilstuna is a workers’ town, so people here are suspicious they care about functionality over sustainability.” A rummage through the mall finds shirts retailing for 120 kronor, books for 60 kronor and Larsson’s flower pots for 480 kronor.For the workers in the sorting plant, it is an equally demanding job. Matti Koskela, 25, works 10-hour shifts, hauling waste from cars into the ReTuna warehouse. “Everything people bring along is very good,” he says. “I’ve shopped in the mall once before, and thought it was great. We all work very hard because people around here don’t have much money. But it’s a lot better than my last job in an incineration plant. I just hope the mall will last.”Another recent arrival to Eskilstuna is a Glaswegian, Kevin Roxburgh. Having lived in Stockholm for 30 years, Roxburgh moved to Eskilstuna two weeks ago to manage ReTuna’s franchise of the charity shop chain, Stadsmissionen. “I used to work in fashion, like Anna,” he says. “And I became totally disillusioned with all the waste – I decided I wanted to help people in their lives instead.” Stadsmissionen employs staff with learning difficulties and long-term unemployed people. It was founded in Roxburgh’s home town, under the name Glasgow City Mission. “I was pleasantly surprised by the mall,” he says, “and I think this recycling system is brilliant – it’s much better than Stockholm’s and definitely better than the UK’s.” Roxburgh recently gained Swedish citizenship, because of “all this Brexit bullshit”, and says he has no plans to move back. “This is the real community spirit here,” he adds.Any waste, or “resources”, that cannot be resold in ReTuna, finds its way to the Lilla Nyby sorting centre a 20-minute drive away. From the outside, Lilla Nyby is a typical waste plant: heaps of putrid rubbish waiting to be sorted, opportunistic gulls swooping and diggers carving through the mounds. There is a noticeable lack of people at Lilla Nyby, though. Inside the warehouse, the recycling bags whirr through a maze of conveyor belts, passing camera points which recognise their different colours and then swat them off the line accordingly. The result is a seamless trash-maze that allows five people to process 20,000 tonnes of waste a year.As well as simply sorting the waste, food waste is composted at Lilla Nyby and sold back to residents. “It’s so high-quality, it sells out,” Hellström says – and the biogas from food waste at the plant is used for the city’s buses. In a small, humid shed behind the warehouse, an Uppsala University research project is taking place. They are testing the use of maggot larvae to digest food waste, then using the fattened maggots to feed to livestock, and potentially even humans. The worm has turned.Sorting your household rubbish into seven different categories may sound like a step too far, yet the residents of Eskilstuna, it seems, have become waste aficionados. This might be because to opt out of the multicoloured scheme means doubling the yearly household waste disposal fee of 2,894 kronor. Yet, for new parents Caroline and Marlin Sommerlid, the recycling scheme is a moral obligation.“We’re very proud citizens to have this scheme here,” Caroline says, her five-week-old baby resting on her shoulder. “I want my children to grow up in a world that hasn’t been destroyed, and for them to leave it in better shape than they got it in.”We meet in their newly built, eco-friendly house situated in the leafy suburbs of Eskilstuna. “I built this house to fit in with our recycling systems,” construction engineer Marlin says, showing the integrated bins nestled beneath the sink. “Caroline is obsessed – I came from a place where people didn’t recycle, but her parents were militant.” “When I go to places without the sorting systems, I feel as if I’m back in the 80s,” Caroline says.The Social Democrat leader of the municipality, Jimmy Jansson, says other Swedish towns are slow to catch up because of a “lack of knowledge”. Born and raised in the town, Jansson left school at the height of its deindustrialisation. “We lost 10,000 inhabitants, and we’re still recovering from that time,” he says. “We had to find a new identity, and it felt natural to tackle the question of being a dirty industrial town. We had an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes and, even though we have not entirely recovered, it’s not difficult to do the right thing – it’s our responsibility.”With continued high unemployment, these environmental policies could appear nothing more than a cynical rebrand for a town which, in Jansson’s words, “nobody wanted to come to”. Yet, Birath says, while the new recycling scheme has created 50 new jobs – a small dent in the almost 15,000 unemployed – for residents, the radical green action has not just put Eskilstuna back on the map. It has done so in a way that makes them proud.“It has been a long time coming,” Bergström says. “It’s hard to get a town on board that has been so scarred by change in the past – so if we can make a success of it here, it could happen anywhere in the world.

The UK is obliged to follow European law as an EU member state, but also during a possible Brexit transition period that could last until the end of 2022.The commission has asked the UK to spell out more detail in several areas of the draft plan: it has called for stronger analysis on air pollution and more specific goals on research and innovation. The commission also wants the government to include details on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.The government was also praised for “good practice” over the Climate Change Act, which contains legally binding long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.The UK is expected to improve its energy and climate plan following the commission’s recommendations. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which oversees UK climate policy, has been contacted for comment.Last week, the British government pledged to enshrine in law a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, making the UK the first major industrial economy to legislate in this way.France and Germany are among countries that want the EU to agree a net zero target by 2050. Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden are also supporting the goal of net zero by 2050 “at the latest”, but some central and eastern European states are opposed.EU leaders are expected to spar over the issue at a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday. At the summit, the heads of state and government will sign off on the bloc’s “strategic agenda” for the next five years. Last week, a leaked version of the document was lambasted by green campaigners as “a collection of buzzwords” for the section on tackling the climate crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54254baf33b8bd9142d1ca3b6af62d2c3045e3e/0_246_4680_2809/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35a2617e47e9734948da092f32bdee50","title":"ministers reject charge of 1p an item to clean up fast fashion","story":"Government backs only voluntary measures for clothing industry despite rising environmental costs Ministers have rejected recommendations from MPs to clean up the huge environmental impact of fast fashion, which sees 300,000 tonnes of clothing burned or buried in the UK every year.MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) said a charge of 1p for each garment was urgently needed to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry. But the government’s response, published on Tuesday, failed to commit to this, stating only that it could be considered by 2025.The MPs report, Fixing Fashion, was published in February and revealed that UK shoppers buy more new clothes than any other European country, and roughly twice as many as in Germany and Italy. It also said textile production contributes more emissions to the climate crisis than international aviation and shipping combined, consumes lake-sized volumes of fresh water and creates chemical and microplastic pollution.The cross-party EAC said there should be a ban on incinerating or landfilling unsold clothes that can be reused or recycled. But the government said: “We believe that positive approaches are required to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban.”“Fashion producers should be forced to clear up the mountains of waste they create,” said EAC chair Mary Creagh. “The government has rejected our call, demonstrating that it is content to tolerate practices that trash the environment, having just committed to net zero emission targets. Urgent action must be taken to change the fast-fashion business model which produces cheap clothes that cost the earth.”These include a reduced rate of VAT on clothes repair services, as implemented in Sweden, and that fashion companies whose products have lower environmental impacts should be rewarded by government schemes and those that do not should be penalised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf013e602a9c948575c7dfa5c35ec2cd718daa5e/0_741_3487_2093/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2064e4d8ed934c404047d3ff95cce72","title":"gloria vanderbilt a life in pictures","story":"Known as ‘the poor little rich girl’, she survived family tragedy and a sensational court case to become an actor, designer and fashion icon.

Two orgies of bullets bookend the adventure of an outlaw gang on the Mexican border, setting a new standard for the depiction of violence in its day that persists as dizzyingly intense now, 50 years out from the initial release in 1969. Rapid-fire cutting, whiplash zooms and tricks with repetition could combine to dilate a single moment in time and make gunfire into a symphony of wanton destruction. All the glorious slow-motion shots of smoking barrels and spurting entry wounds had been mounted for a loftier purpose than base titillation, however. As stated in David Weddle’s Peckinpah biography If They Move … Kill ’Em!, the film-maker himself found it disturbing, the tooth-gnashing glee with which audiences received what he had intended as a cathartic purging of violent impulses. He thought he was making something closer to a morality play he didn’t count on the public’s thirst for arterial spray.Legend goes that in 1967, an on-the-skids Peckinpah (squabbles with studios on his last feature led to a temporary exile in the bush leagues of TV) went to see Bonnie and Clyde and upon re-entering the light of day, figured, “I can do that.” Indeed, his grand return to moviemaking one-upped the convulsive shootout that brutally ended the bank robbers’ spree, and yet he was just as preoccupied with the moment’s social significance. Like that film’s Arthur Penn, he saw America at a chaotic crossroads epitomized by the ongoing warfare in Vietnam and unrest on the home front. In another story of thieves with questionable honor even among themselves, he planted a signpost at the end of an era.John Ford’s The Searchers had set the deconstructive ball rolling in 1956 by uncovering a wounded reactionary soul beneath the leathery, commanding exterior of the cowboy archetype, a pop-cultural revisionism that Peckinpah extended to its most extreme conclusion. He establishes early on that though William Holden, Ernest Borgnine and Ben Johnson may look like the good guys, they’re not here to save the day. The opening scene mocks the expectation for gallantry, dressing the men up in the uniforms of US cavalry soldiers and shooting them like the proud descendants of John Wayne. They’re actually stickup artists keen to relieve a railroad office of its silver reserves, no matter how many civilians have to die in the process, and that’s only the latest feat in a long and illustrious career of criminal activity. Suddenly, the viewer realizes that those clothes had most likely been stripped from the corpses of enemies they’d already killed.We’re dealing with some bad hombres, the kind of cud-chewing sonsabitches who’ll shoot your eye out as soon as look at you. They fit the description the critic Ty Burr once gave of John Wayne’s character in The Searchers: a type of man crucial to “winning” the west and who had to be left behind if civilization was to follow. Peckinpah and co-writer Walon Green situated their script in the year 1913, as horse-drawn carriages had begun to give way to newfangled automobiles. The principal characters recognize that they’re approaching fossilization – no spring chicken, that Borgnine – and plot one final score to get them all set for retirement. An arresting image inserted into the opening credits, that of a scorpion overrun by fire ants, grows into a symbol of one toxic influence succumbing to another. They fear they just weren’t made for these times, in an America with no use for the gunslinger myth.They may have been made for ours, however. The Wild Bunch stands out as the first western to go full-bore with its reappraisal of frontier narratives, and remains the most ferociously modern example by virtue of its coal-black heart. The question of integrity’s importance, utility and limits haunts the band of no-goodniks as they cut a dusty swath through the Texas desert. They turn on one another whenever convenient, more than willing to step on each other’s faces to climb out of mortal peril. As Holden’s leading man Pike Bishop growls, “$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties.” He speaks this crucial line of dialogue to his compatriot Angel, soon to be left for dead as a captive of a sadistic general in the Mexican military. When his change of heart comes, both too little and too late, the abrupt growth of a conscience cues up the bloodbath grand finale. Decency can be a fatal liability in a world without a code.Peckinpah’s notion that mercy and virtue may be outmoded ideas in the hectic, grabby sprawl of the 20th century has ossified into prophecy as we’ve rolled into the 21st. As with seemingly all pop culture predating the now, it’s tempting to project on to the ongoing molasses flood of presidential politics is the current Republican party not a “wild bunch” of its own, abandoning their principles one by one, throwing each other under the bus for a taste of power? This same concept applies to any fractious group organized around mutual distrust, whether that’s the cowboy heirs shooting from the hip in America’s police force or the ided country harboring them. His work resonates wherever betrayal can be adopted as an acceptable strategy for success.The film’s nihilist streak – or at least, its cynical suggestion that believing in anything sturdier than nihilism must necessarily be a losing game – invests it with a spitting, yowling nastiness both formative and alien to the current cinema landscape of blandly gritty antiheroes. Peckinpah’s senseless bloodshed foregrounded its own senselessness to comment on a time losing touch with its humanity that we now think of this period as the “good old days” indicates just how far we’ve all fallen. The post-Wild Bunch years saw film-makers in the US rush into an onscreen arms race, detonating ever-greater quantities of squib packs as if in competition with one another. But the depths of its creator’s jaded outlook, his sorrowful elegy for an epoch of American heroism that never really existed, his unsettlingly well-founded fear of a future dominated by self-interest – that’s still bulletproof."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d63f205c689d4deba95a116726fcb9e2511cae/0_1683_4624_2772/master/4624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d7dd382a06726e14fb113fe3a3f1951","title":"nigel slater new potatoes with broad beans and butter sauce recipe","story":"Cute little spuds and beans in a hearty yet piquant sauceLightly scrub 350g of new potatoes then boil them in salted water for 15 minutes or until tender to the point of a knife.Pod enough broad beans to give you 200g of beans.

Mason Mount, the Chelsea midfielder who excelled on loan at Derby County last season, is expected to start instead.Aidy Boothroyd, the England head coach, has informed the squad of his plans and insisted on Monday that they had all accepted his decision.Among other surprises is the inclusion of Dominic Solanke over Dominic Calvert-Lewin in attack. Solanke, Golden Ball winner at the under 20 World Cup in 2017, has scored several key goals in qualifying for England but had a disappointing Premier League campaign with Bournemouth and Liverpool.Boothroyd, meanwhile, has said England’s hopes of winning will be on the line from the moment their tournament starts against France. Only the three group winners and the best runner-up qualify for the semi-finals in Italy and the England head coach warns there is no margin for error as a consequence. Boothroyd, bidding to lead England to the title for the first time since 1984, has warned his players there will be no gentle introduction to the competition in Cesena.“It is knockout football from day one,” he said. “You don’t get the luxury of having a game to just assess things whether you win, lose or draw and then have the next game to accumulate some points.

Boothroyd believes they pose a formidable threat.Jake Clarke‑Salter has been appointed England captain for the Euros. The 21-year-old Chelsea defender, who spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, says he will take inspiration from the former Stamford Bridge captain John Terry.“John Terry is one of my idols and I look up to him a lot.

They claimed Bowyer “feels he should be paid like many other Championship managers” and added: “That the average Championship club makes a loss of around £15m per year is not something players should care about. The owners are crazy.”Yet Bowyer is understood to have contacted Duchâtelet immediately after the release of the statement – which had prompted a furious reaction among the fanbase – and conducted further talks with the owner overnight, with compromise duly reached.“We went on a real journey last season,” said the manager, who had originally been appointed on a caretaker basis at the club before taking over permanently last September. “The club came together – the players, the staff, the fans and we achieved something special. The journey hasn’t finished yet and I’m delighted this has all been agreed.“This has been a long process and I never wanted to leave, I love this club. I’d like to thank the owner for giving me the initial opportunity and now for continuing to believe in me. We have a fantastic fanbase here and my focus continues to be getting our squad in the best possible shape for the Championship next season.”Charlton finished third in League One and defeated Sunderland in the play-off final to secure a place in the second tier after a three-year absence. Duchâtelet had cited Bowyer’s desire to use an agent to negotiate a deal as potentially constituting a conflict of interest over transfer policy. “What Lee has achieved in his short time at the club is very impressive,” said the owner, who is attempting to sell Charlton to the Cardiff City chairman, Mehmet Dalman. “He has united the club once again.“I would like to thank Lee for his professionalism during this process.

Speaking from his home in Kumbakonam, with his wife, Menaka and daughter, Aniya, who turned seven last week, Ayyappan said: “I cannot describe what it felt like to hold my daughter again after so many days and nights. I’m really happy. She is also very happy.”He last saw Aniya when she was four years old.It marks the end of a long, drawn-out case where the captain and crew were abandoned by the vessel owner, Elite Way Marine Services, unable to leave the ship fearing the loss of their claim to thousands of dollars in unpaid wages.Ayyappan sent the  a video that recorded the emotional moment he finally left his ship, MV Azraqmoiah, shot from a speedboat carrying him safely to shore. “When I touched land, I felt like flying – oh my God,” said the merchant seaman of 20 years. “This is the day we dreamed of. My cup is overflowing again and again.”The seafarers endured terrible hardship aboard, as their supplies dwindled and finally ran out, prompting them to seek help to survive. Ali’s father passed away in August 2018, yet still they waited for the wages. There were days when a lack of fuel left the vessel in darkness in the busy shipping lane, endangering the crew and other ships. The Indian consulate and the charity Mission to Seafarers were able to help by providing food and water.In all, 36 sailors in at least seven vessels were abandoned by Elite Way Marine Services, according to the Federal Transport Authority (FTA) in the UAE. The case was first highlighted by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the  in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way’s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. “We have a financial problem,” said Gafar at the time. “For one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.”The company could not be contacted for this article.It has since emerged that the international attention brought by the ’s coverage in April and May helped to pressurise the owners to act.In February, Mission to Seafarers and the FTA took legal action against the vessel’s owner over the unpaid salaries. The first ship was arrested under maritime law in April, followed by other vessels, including the Azraqmoiah, which was sold to pay the seafarers’ salaries. The FTA has banned the company from operating in UAE waters.Jasamin Fichte, of the law firm Fichte \u0026amp Co, said the vessel’s owner had “made a mockery” of the UAE legal system. She vowed to lobby for better regulations.Fichte said: “It’s obvious to everyone involved the ship owner has to pay their wages. If it hadn’t been for our actions, the crew would not have been paid at all. But the vessel owner got away with paying less. He has made a mockery of the legal system here.”The conditions on the ship were “horrible”, she added.“Such actions would be considered criminal in many jurisdictions. Seafarers were suffering from physical and psychological conditions. We were worried for their safety. No food, no water, no air conditioning in 40 degree heat – it’s not something I would wish on anybody.”Fichte said she will meet with the UAE government to talk about how they can stop the rising problem of vessel owners abandoning crew in their waters. A law to seize abandoned ships is already under discussion in the country.Rev Andy Bowerman, the Middle East and south-east Asia director of Mission to Seafarers, praised Ayyappan for helping to highlight the “unacceptable” issue of abandonment at sea.“He realised that if he held out for longer, he would highlight the issue – and there is a bigger issue here,” said Bowerman. “At some point the UAE has got to change its approach to seafarers.”He urged the UAE to sign up to an amendment to the maritime labour convention, which guarantees better protection for seafarers by requiring ships to carry insurance to pay them if they are abandoned.Worldwide, 4,866 seafarers on a total of 336 vessels have been abandoned on board ship since 2004, according to a database by the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization.“The flag states should do more,” said Mohamed Arracedi, the ITF’s coordinator for the Arab world and Iran, who has dealt with over 100 cases of abandonment and recovered $1.26m in owed wages in 2018. “Many of the cases we are dealing with in the Emirates are severe abandonment cases. Why do owners abandon their ships in the UAE? A little bit of speculation, it is probably a lack of regulation. They know if they abandon ships in Spain, the port states can intervene and the maritime labour convention is applied. These things can be solved quicker.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/029fc929fdf9600efa5e89a15589cb20f310884c/0_370_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0a2750734db9780cb060e7e10da4fa","title":"herbivore jade facial roller can it improve my skin and bring me peace and harmony","story":"I’m not sure it is doing much for my complexion, but it is certainly a gorgeous addition to any bathroomI have no idea what facial rolling with gemstones does. I understand that it is popular with lifestyle bloggers and various Kardashian satellites and, if it is good enough for them, you may as well punch yourself on the nose for the good it will do you. But while jade, rose quartz and amethyst are on trend, the practice is thought to be an ancient one, with roots in Chinese alternative medicine. (That doesn’t mean it is good. Live bee acupuncture has been around a while, too.) Anyway, the thinking is that semi-precious stones have specific qualities.I do buy that coldness and pressure are good things: Paul Newman used to dunk his face in ice water several times a day. I don’t shy away from the metaphysical either. After all, I find the company name, Herbivore, ineffably funny.The roller is well-balanced, nicely heavy, and comes with a velveteen carry pouch in pink. There are instructions on the box, as well as online tutorials. After applying a facial oil, a sample of which is included, I push the roller from my cheek to hairline, then above my eyebrows and along my jawline. I feel as if I am applying an undercoat to a wall that is spongy with damp. I don’t have enough bone structure to differentiate these areas, so end up chasing a wave of chin fat over my nose and, inconceivably, across my forehead. The sight of this reminds me of street cleaners pushing water into the gutter with a broom. It is not very Paul Newman.Using the tool, I am reminded of my razor. The Messerschmitt 5000 with Flex-Tek – I forget what it’s really called – but it has about 18 blades, and the head has a single blade on its base, for scraping stubborn, under-nose hair. The facial roller, too, has a smaller wheel at the bottom to treat delicate under-eye skin. My razor has raised rubber chevrons running along its shaft, for secure purchase. The Herbivore’s handle is made of jade for no practical reason, with delicate gold embossing. One of these items reassures me that, even without bristles, I will never be shorn of power. The other insinuates I am a precious gem, who should be touched only by other precious gems. I suspect the main thing being conditioned here is gender.Still it is a lovely sensation, and definitely calming on the skin. I can’t say if my muscles are getting toned, but I do feel slightly blissed out by the cold roll of my gem wheel. I don’t really have the serenity for proper facial rolling. I keep pushing the thing harder into my neck like a massager, trying to work out a kink. After a few minutes, the stone gets warm. Maybe I’m jaded, but I don’t know if enough is being achieved.I think I can live with my lymph undrained. A face massage by hand feels like a better way to increase circulation, while teabags or cucumber slices combat puffiness just as well. (Or even tablespoons straight from the freezer, which I once tried, to reduce my eyebags. They did stick to my eyelids, though.)The saving grace is that this green, elongated hourglass-shaped implement is a gorgeous thing. The soft tone of the stone, the green and gold, are highly alluring. Over the next few weeks, I find myself idly running the facial roller over my neck and cheeks. I like seeing it in the bathroom I like it touching my skin. Sometimes it traps a beard hair, but that’s my fault for not shaving. Besides, a little pinch is a small price to pay for stress relief. Maybe I have worked out my kink after all.Totally beside the point takeawayWomen should definitely be using men’s razors, because they are cheaper and sharper and last longer.Wellness or hellness?Too precious for its own good, to be stone cold. 25 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

After her second miscarriage she said she had to arrange the medical procedure around constituency advice surgeries.“Heartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I’ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected,” she writes. “Now I’m pregnant once more and terrified – not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible.”Creasy said she had approached Ipsa about funding for cover but was told it “does not ‘recognise’ that MPs go on maternity leave”.“Humiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding – or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don’t miss out,” she writes. “If a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of services. In Denmark, a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed.”Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told the  she had been refused extra help with her first pregnancy, a year after she arrived in parliament in 2015. Having given birth to her second child four months ago, she said she had not even bothered to make the application.“That is because of the negative reaction I had first time around. They were utterly baffled I was even having a baby, I was passed around and I was told ‘we have not got a historic policy on that because we have not had many women in parliament who give birth’,” she said.“It was painting a picture that MPs could only be men or older women. I don’t think it was meant to be malicious. I think it was genuinely something that had not been dealt with, but it is the most normal thing in the world, having a baby.”Siddiq said she had carried on doing her constituency emails from her hospital bed, but had been supported in constituency events by Keir Starmer, whose constituency neighbours hers.“He helped because we unofficially paired up, but that was the goodness of his heart. If you share a borough with an opposition MP, they wouldn’t do it,” she said.She has continued doing advice surgeries and meetings straight after giving birth, but said proxy voting had vastly improved her experience after the birth of her son.“It has made such a huge difference, not just to my mental health but my physical health, not having to travel to parliament for very late night votes,” she said.Creasy said the struggle MPs experienced trying to take adequate maternity leave was one of many issues where fertility was still a barrier to equality, highlighting non-disclosure agreements used to cover up maternity discrimination and the postcode lottery of fertility treatments. ”Prejudices and unhelpful tropes about motherhood suffocate female representatives – whether we have children or not – in a way that is rarely true for our male counterparts,” she said.“For my work on abortion rights I have been trolled relentlessly with the charge that it is my own childlessness that drives my ‘desire to kill other people’s babies’.”Creasy said she had decided it was “time to stop asking nicely for the discrimination to be dealt with” but said she had found herself on the receiving end of a “bitter reminder that it’s still often men who will make the choices that determine if that battle will be won”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

We help them rebuild their lives “Somebody being shot in front of you, or you yourself shooting somebody, became just like drinking a glass of water.” An interview with a child soldier from Sierra Leone I read recently really struck a chord with me, because it’s the same sort of impact I see working with young people caught up in county lines. Exploitation normalises violence. Young lives are scarred.County lines describes when gangs from cities expand drug networks to other areas of the country, typically using dedicated mobile phone lines to supply drugs.I manage a team of young persons substance misuse workers and am an experienced safeguarding lead. My team work alongside schools, social workers, mental health services and the police to support young people exploited through county lines. I’ve worked in the drug and alcohol sector for 20 years. No one gets into this kind of work because it’s easy, and I’ve had my fair share of ups and downs, but I’ve never experienced anything quite like this it traumatises the young people involved.Operations in major cities seek new markets outside urban hubs for their drugs, primarily crack cocaine and heroin. The expansion of their networks into the regions often comes with exploitation.Children and vulnerable adults are often coerced into ferrying and stashing the drugs. They can be homeless or missing people, addicts, people living in care, trapped in poverty, or suffering from mental illness or learning difficulties.\u0026nbspEven older and physically infirm people have been targeted and officers have observed a gang member attending drug rehab to find potential runners.\u0026nbspInitially they can be lured in with money, gifts and the prospect of status. But this can quickly turn into the use of violence, sometimes sexual.Children without criminal records - known in the trade as clean skins - are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives.\u0026nbspCharity The Children\u0027s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines.\u0026nbspThe Children\u0027s Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.Google “county lines” and you’ll see endless news stories about arrests and drug seizures. While it’s important the adults involved are brought to justice, the message that the “war on county lines” is being won misses the bigger picture. It’s more than just a criminal issue. Behind the headlines adults are exploiting children on a mass scale. It’s too easy to forget that we’re talking about kids: it’s child abuse, and the language we use needs to reflect this.My team is working with a group of boys in their early teens who were groomed into joining a county lines gang. People assume they must be from broken homes but many have had very normal childhoods in the countryside.The boys were hanging out at a skatepark when a man asked if they wanted to have a smoke in his flat and play computer games. He later introduced them to other men who gave them free cannabis, takeaway food, trainers, tracksuits and hoodies. It was as though Christmas had come early. After around six months, the men started to ask them for favours, such as dropping off packages at certain addresses.Eventually, the young people were given a substantial amount of cannabis and told to sell it to other teens. The men took advantage of them by showing them a life of luxury they’d never seen before. They were promised the best clothes and cars, but, above all, that people would respect them. These boys were only 13 years old.To achieve this dream, they were told they had to start selling class A substances such as crack and heroin. The men brainwashed them that the vulnerable people who use these drugs weren’t human because “they are ruining your town and don’t deserve any respect”.Young people have told my team how they’ve committed horrific acts of violence against these people, who are members of the community they grew up in. Taken out of context, you would think these teenagers were monsters. But it is important to realise the extent to which they’ve been coerced and desensitised to the feelings of others. Like a child soldier, they’ve seen things a child should never see.When young people feel vulnerable they look to adults who they trust for support. But the men who promised them the world turn their backs on them when the authorities get involved. Services like mine pick up the pieces, offering them the emotional connection they need to rebuild that sense of trust and belonging.Recently one young person asked his key worker what they used to do when they were 16. My colleague described a normal teenage life of going to college, socialising with friends and making a fool of themselves at parties. The young person was shocked, admitting he’d only been to a party once when he was allowed to “knock off early” as he’d shifted all his “gear”.These children are often excluded from school and miss the milestones most of us take for granted. They have never experienced the nerves of the first day in college, the joy of finishing exams or the freedom of independence.Research by the Children’s Society found young people who are criminally exploited frequently experience emotional and psychological trauma, often due to violence they’ve seen and been forced to commit. It’s therefore no wonder that many of the young people my team work with are showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. One boy who’s soon to turn 18 said: “I can’t be around normal people because if they say the wrong thing I may end up in a fight. I’m not like other people.”As they get older, many of the young people exploited though county lines will become involved with the criminal justice system. Once they slip into adulthood, this can often mean prison.But sentencing someone brands them a criminal it’s the ultimate judgment, blaming them rather than the adults pulling the strings. That’s why in the service I run we’ve banned the term county lines. Instead, we refer to it solely as exploitation. Obviously these young people are involved in crime, but they’re also very much the victims of crime. They need to be listened to without judgment. They need a way back, rather than a locked door.• Sonya Jones is a service manager and safeguarding lead at Young Addaction, which offers advice via www.addaction.org.ukwebchat"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/330503d9d270acbca66f8fedd705e672f3ccc431/134_35_3232_1939/master/3232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfba4cbf3f11562dd80104b62e61a2be","title":"nick kyrgios disrespect top players daniil medvedev","story":"• ‘I probably don’t show them respect – they’re just good at tennis’• Daniil Medvedev says he always wanted Roger Federer to loseNick Kyrgios says he is happy to keep his feud with Novak Djokovic ticking over at Wimbledon next month – while Daniil Medvedev, another of the sport’s young rebels, uttered the ultimate heresy on Monday when he revealed he always wanted Roger Federer to lose.For the first time since 2013, when the Latvian loose cannon Ernests Gulbis accused Federer, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray of being “boring”, there is insurrection in the air and boredom seems the underlying cause of the latest unrest.Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 20-year-old Greek who is top seed here, is impatient for other young players to challenge harder against the elite. Kyrgios, who has already upset his betters, thinks the stars do have a hold over the next generation – but shouldn’t. “I probably don’t show them respect,” the Australian admitted. “They’re just good at tennis. I just don’t know if the younger guys are good enough to beat them over five sets.”Meanwhile Medvedev, one of the game’s bright hopes, says that growing up in an era when the Big Three have won nearly all the important trophies had never sat well with him.Shortly after dismissing the 35-year-old Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-4 in 70 minutes on day one of the Fever-Tree championships, the 23-year-old Russian said: “When I was 10, I hated Roger. I just couldn’t see him win again. I was cheering from the first round for other guys, because that’s the way I was. When Barcelona was winning everything in football, I wanted them to lose badly. If I lose first round, I don’t care if it’s Nadal, Roger or Novak who wins the French Open. I’m just upset about myself losing in the first round. That’s how it is.”Kyrgios, who said in a recent podcast that Djokovic’s cup-of-love victory celebrations were cringeworthy, was nevertheless happy to laud Nadal for his 12th Roland Garros triumph, adding that Wimbledon, which starts on 1 July, could be a shootout between Djokovic and Federer. “Over five sets I don’t think anyone will ever beat Rafa at the French Open,” Kyrgios said. “It’s just too hard physically. But at Wimbledon it’s going to be tough to beat Novak or Federer, five sets.”Kyrgios, who faces the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino on Tuesday, is not intimidated by anyone. He won all four sets against Djokovic in their only two matches, back-to-back two years ago in Acapulco and Indian Wells, and has promised to imitate his love-to-the-crowd gesture if he beats him again. He said of his fractious relationship with the spiritual Serb, “If I play Novak, he’d just be determined to get one win against me.“I have played Rafa a bunch of times. We have beaten each other, as well. I think they are motivated to beat me in general. I don’t think before those comments they were, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really care.’ They wanted to beat me, regardless. But my opinions won’t change. I don’t mind. When we go out there and we battle, that’s what it is.”Kyrgios had a mixed message for his friend Murray, however, two days before the Scot returns to the game in doubles with Feliciano López: “Just to see him back healthy and seeing him happy on court is all that matters. He’s the first person I saw here on the court, doing doubles drills, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It’s just good to see him back – but I don’t think I want to carry him for Wimbledon dubs.”Cameron Norrie, one of five British players in the Queen’s draw, found the two-times grand slam finalist, Kevin Anderson, too strong over two hours and 20 minutes and the South African won 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4.In two and a half hours of late-evening drama the British qualifier James Ward came agonisingly close to going through to the second round but in the end Gilles Simon saw him off 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2).Kyle Edmund, Dan Evans and Jay Clarke play on Tuesday. Evans, coming off 10 straight wins and two grass-court titles, plays the three-times major champion Stan Wawrinka for the third time, having taken a set off him in Indian Wells this year and nearly beaten him in five high-quality sets in the third round of the US Open three years ago.Johanna Konta impressed in her first match since reaching the French Open semi-finals to ease into the second round of the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham.The British No 1 made a seamless transition from clay to grass, beating Anett Kontaveit 6-4, 6-2. The Estonian is only ranked two places lower than Konta but the No 7 seed played at a high level throughout and wrapped up victory in an hour and 12 minutes.The only blip came when she dropped serve at 4-3 in the opening set but she re-established her advantage straight away and the second set was particularly impressive, with Konta displaying her more rounded game to great effect.There was disappointment, though, for British No 2 Heather Watson, who let a lead slip in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Barbora Strycova. Watson was unhappy with a number of line calls and declined to shake the umpire’s hand at the end of the match.Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan pulled off an upset in the opening contest of the day, defeating the fourth seed Elina Svitolina 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Svitolina had been struggling with a knee injury and, despite ending a four-match losing streak by reaching the third round of the French Open, she admitted she may be forced to skip the grass-court season.

He eventually scrapes a single, whereupon Root eases into the covers for a couple. Before our eyes, England’s anchor is turning into a yacht.30th over: England 164-2 (Root 45, Morgan 0) So Gulbadin has 1-25 off seven overs, and Bairstow misses out on a hundred. His 90 came off 99 balls: he played some superb strokes without ever quite banishing the dots.Gulbadin does the trick! This time a slower ball does deceive Bairstow, who plays a back-foot push, straight back to the bowler. Gulbadin brought himself back, bowled the ball and caught the catch – no wonder he stands there and flexes his biceps, which are enormous. 29th over: England 163-1 (Bairstow 90, Root 44) Mujeeb returns and keeps the runs down to five.“Boring England,” says the subject line from Robert Taylor, though he actually approves. “Seems that England are putting away their usual bombastic approach. I reckon this is because they know Afghanistan have yet to pass 200 and have a quality spin attack on a spinning pitch, so going all guns blazing trying to get 400 is a) unnecessary and b) the strategy most likely to lead to a disastrous collapse.” Yes, there may have been a touch of bananaskinophobia.28th over: England 158-1 (Bairstow 87, Root 42) Gulbadin takes his underperforming starman off and turns to... himself. And it works: just three from the over. But what he really needs to conjure is a wicket.“England have 7 bowlers (counting Root whose Test bowling average is actually below his batting one),” notes Daniel Howell, “two potential wicketkeepers and a captain – leaving only Vince as ‘nothing but a batsman’. But while he doesn’t bowl in internationals, he has taken 22 wickets for Hampshire down the years. Given the batting performance in recent Tests, I can’t help wondering if this ‘pick nothing but a tail’ approach might work wonders in 5 day matches as well…” Good point. A polite request: if you’re using quote marks, please can you make them single ones, as they will appear within doubles and then I won’t have to change them.27th over: England 155-1 (Bairstow 86, Root 40) Now Bairstow wallops Nabi for six. The gulf between these sides is beginning to tell.26th over: England 145-1 (Bairstow 80, Root 38) Bairstow brings up the hundred partnership in style with a back-foot drive off Rashid Khan. These two needed 99 balls to add a hundred, so it’s been an ice cream with a Flake as well as a pair of Yorkies. England have made Rashid look bad (4-0-29-0) while having the opposite effect on the other bowlers. “Grrr!” says John Morrissey. “What is it that you people want? Unless my arithmetic is fundamentally awry, England are going along at a little over 5-an-over, for the loss of one wicket. Continue at that rate and they will have accumulated \u0026gt250 at the end of 50 overs. Accelerate smoothly from 35 overs onwards, without going completely Morganballs and they will be over 300, probably ~320. Afghanistan’s strength is in the bowling, not batting, so the likelihood of them entering the top 5 World Cup run-chases seems, to me, pretty remote.“Enjoy a good quality spin bowling attack vs. a sensible, concentrated batting approach, and revel in the joys of being able to follow it from hundredsthousands of miles away via the medium of print delivered digitally.”25th over: England 139-1 (Bairstow 74, Root 37) Another four from Bairstow, pulling Nabi and beating the man at deep square just by virtue of the intent in his eyes. Afghanistan need to get him out.“Going by some of the dietary advice lately in the ,” says John Starbuck, “I’m surprised we still bother to separate wheat and chaff (16th over). I shall drink a mug of green tea and hope to reach equilibrium.”24th over: England 132-1 (Bairstow 69, Root 35) Bairstow’s itching to assert himself now. He slog-sweeps Rashid Khan for four, then swats him for six. In between, there’s an edge, but even that goes for two. Bairstow has 23 off his last 18 balls. Go Jonny, go big.23rd over: England 118-1 (Bairstow 56, Root 34) Bairstow works Nabi away for three to the cover sweeper’s left. If his batting has been patchy, his running between the wickets has been immaculate, as ever.If you’d like to switch over to the county scene, do join Tanya Aldred.22nd over: England 112-1 (Bairstow 54, Root 30) Gulbadin keeps the plug in, conceding just three.“Mooting around,” says the subject line from our old friend Brian Withington. “Harking back to your 5th over moot with Jim Evans, I see that the word has far more nuance than I had realised. As an adjective it can mean more than just of little practical importance, by encompassing uncertainty worthy of debate. As a verb it can be used to encourage such debate, but as a noun it describes an Anglo Saxon or medieval assembly of like minded souls, and a form of mock judicial proceeding. As you rightly say, where would the OBO be without it?” Blimey.21st over: England 109-1 (Bairstow 52, Root 29) Rashid Khan whistles through an over at a speed that is frankly unsporting. Doesn’t he realise that some people have paragraphs to compose?20th over: England 106-1 (Bairstow 52, Root 26) England’s hundred comes up thanks to yet another little misfield, as short third man allows himself to be nutmegged. The hundred took 117 balls, almost sedate by Morganball standards. Bairstow, perhaps conscious of this, strokes a lovely off-drive to bring up his fifty, off 61 balls. Like Winnie the Pooh with the honeypot, he can surely hear a century calling to him.19th over: England 98-1 (Bairstow 46, Root 24) And we haven’t even seen Rashid Khan yet – but now here he is. His first ball draws a miscue from Root, a Vince-like pop off the top edge which falls short of fine leg. Root recovers to ease a couple through the covers, and Bairstow follows suit with more of a squirt. Afghanistan are looking England squarely in the eye, and it’s fascinating to watch.On the same tack, here’s Guy Hornsby on Twitter. “Sitting here in the sunshine at Old Trafford @TimdeLisle, I’m not really sure if England know whether to stick or twist. Root can play any situation, but YJB seems frustrated but can’t wallop it as England don’t want to lose more wickets. There’s a few grumbles from the locals.” Are you sure that’s the trouble with Bairstow? Morgan’s England don’t usually worry about losing another wicket.18th over: England 92-1 (Bairstow 43, Root 21) Gulbadin’s slower ball is meat and drink to Bairstow, who clomps it for four, back past the bowler’s ear. He’s got his customary 40 and played some fine shots, but he has occupied 56 balls. The only England batsman to have gone at a run a ball today is the one who usually plays the anchor, Root. And that’s drinks, with the game nicely poised.17th over: England 86-1 (Bairstow 38, Root 20) Rahmat serves up a full toss and Root steps right out to sweep for four, well in front of square. He follows up with two effortless back-foot shots, a pull and a wristy cut. Does anyone in the world at the moment have a better eye for length?16th over: England 75-1 (Bairstow 36, Root 11) Another edge from Bairstow, through the vacant slips off Gulbadin, who has brought himself back. Still plenty of dots, which add up to a moral victory for Afghanistan.15th over: England 72-1 (Bairstow 34, Root 10) Four singles off Nabi. “No hint,” says Mahendra Killedar, “of much anticipated 500 so far...” Very true.14th over: England 68-1 (Bairstow 32, Root 8) Rahmat Shah comes on, with his leg-breaks, and immediately beats Bairstow with a beauty that grips and lifts and leaves him. Shane Warne would have been delighted with that. Later in the over, Bairstow bites back with a straight whack, from the crease, that feels like a catch for a moment, only to carry for six. Game on.13th over: England 60-1 (Bairstow 25, Root 7) Gulbadin brings himself on, seam replacing spin, and just when they are threatening to dominate, both batsmen play false shots. Bairstow gets a bit wafty outside off and nearly gives a catch to backward point, and Root plays that stroke we were discussing the other day that has several names – the Harrow, French or Boris cut.Meanwhile Damian Kemp in Dublin is picking up on my little exchange with Neil Kempson in the 7th over. “‘That is a very good question’ sounds like the start of an answer you might have given in your OBO job interview.” Ha. 12th over: England 59-1 (Bairstow 24, Root 7) Spin replaces seam as Dawlat takes his sweater. He was more expensive than Mujeeb, but also more incisive (5-0-30-1). Nabi comes on and, to his second ball, Bairstow brings out the slog-sweep. A few singles and then Root, taking his time, late-cuts for his first four. Eleven off the over, so this may be the moment that England took control.11th over: England 48-1 (Bairstow 18, Root 2) Mujeeb continues, and carries on giving a masterclass – just two off the over. His figures are 6-0-18-0 and Afghanistan are, if anything, on top.10th over: England 46-1 (Bairstow 17, Root 1) Vince’s downfall was propping forward, so that a spicy bouncer was in his face before he knew it. He edged into his helmet, which made the catch even easier. Root comes in, watches a wide go by and then gets off the mark to his first legitimate ball, gliding to third man.“Re the comment that the group is all but decided,” says Finbar Saunders on Twitter, “With hardly any of the top 4 yet to play each other they’ll all take wins from one another. Add to this that EnglandNZ and Ind all need at least 3 wins to progress and you’ll see it’s still all to play for.”Oh Vince. Another duff pull, another top edge, and this time the man at short fine leg makes no mistake. The president is on his feet.9th over: England 42-0 (Vince 24, Bairstow 17) Bairstow paddles Mujeeb straight to the man at short fine leg, and there’s another misfield. Maybe they are nervous after all. “Morning Tim from a surprisingly sunny Old Trafford (even blue skies)!” says Natalia Marsden. “During the monsoon-esque rain we had in Manchester yesterday evening, I encountered the Afghanistan team disembarking from their team bus into (a very posh) hotel. Needless to say, they did not seem best pleased to be arriving into miserable Manchester, with plenty of muttering and pointing at the ominous sky. We really did have a lot of rain yesterday, so chapeau to the groundstaff for allowing us to have some play. Here’s hoping the ever-unlucky Vince takes his opportunity today, he’s usually a good player of spin and he really is a beautiful player to watch.On another note, there’s still plenty of tickets available – £40 from the ticket office I believe!”8th over: England 40-0 (Vince 23, Bairstow 16) Dawlat overpitches and Vince sends the ball flying through the air with the greatest of ease. Then he picks up two from a misfield in the covers, and is missed at deep square, top-edging a pull, as the fielder sees it late and simply fails to arrive. That over was Vince, and possibly Afghanistan, in a nutshell.7th over: England 32-0 (Vince 15, Bairstow 16) Bairstow shapes to pull Mujeeb, sees some sharp turn (the other way, from leg), and pulls out, if you can pull out of a pull.“I was just wondering,” says Neil Kempson, “when one applies to be a  OBOer, does the interview have more emphasis on cricketing journalism skills or one’s witticisms and abilities to keep the conversation dynamic and flowing?” That is a very good question.6th over: England 30-0 (Vince 14, Bairstow 16) Now England get going as Dawlat loses his length. Bairstow plays an imperious whack-pull and Vince gets away with a mistimed off drive that ends up going for four.5th over: England 20-0 (Vince 9, Bairstow 11) Mujeeb tosses one up, out of the back of the hand, and Bairstow pounces with an off drive for four. But still, plenty of dots. Afghanistan, in front of Mr President, are not showing any nerves.“Bit puzzled,” says Jim Evans, “by England’s decision not to utilise the squad more fully in this match. Opportunity missed to protect Wood’s ankle and Rashid’s shoulder, while getting Curran and Dawson into the tournament. It’s not a question of taking Afghanistan lightly. Competition to make the squad was fierce and no one in the final XV should be viewed as an outsider. Any thoughts? (Other than it being a moot point now anyway…)“ I agree. And where would the OBO be if we ruled out moot points?4th over: England 15-0 (Vince 9, Bairstow 6) An equally good over from Dawlat, conceding only a single.“Morning Tim.” Morning David Horn. “I captained my school 3rd XI for one glorious season, so I feel qualified to say: Eoin Morgan knows more about cricket  his England team than I do. If he says ‘bat first’, then I stand squarely behind him (at a respectful distance, and slightly in awe of his terrifying icy veins).” Know what you mean, but Mike Brearley knew more about cricket and his England team than any of us, and he still got things horribly wrong in a World Cup final.3rd over: England 14-0 (Vince 9, Bairstow 5) Mujeeb finds his line, outside off, and strings together five dots before Bairstow squeezes a cover drive through for three, thanks to a misfield and some ridiculously good running. “This is an excellent start from Mujeeb,” says Nasser. “322,” says the score predictor.2nd over: England 11-0 (Vince 9, Bairstow 2) There’s a case for spin at both ends, but Gulbadin goes with Dawlat’s medium-fast seamers. He drops short and Vince is onto it like a shot – a very good shot, a whipped pull for the first four of the day. “Armchair critic here,” says Nigel Cleaver. Join the club. “Played u16 county cricket for Herefordshire, lol!!” Ah, OK, proper player. “For me everything pointed to NOT batting first. Where to begin, injuries, lost your key opening batsman, bowling is Afghanistan’s main strength, they haven’t batted beyond 41 overs, only 2 batsmen have reached 50.Surely putting them in, on an English wicket in English surroundings, Archer Wood etc blasting at them was best? Knock them over for 200 or less, Vince then doesn’t have the pressure to do a Roy. Go on Morgan, prove me wrong!” If the aim is just to win, yes but if he’s thinking about giving more players a good opportunity... 1st over: England 4-0 (Vince 4, Bairstow 0) Mujeeb takes the new ball with his off-breaks and James Vince tucks a couple off his legs, twice. Vince has to get a hundred for England some time, and if not today, when?A thought about England’s line-up from Bob O’Hara. “Not only do we have 4 seamers \u0026amp 3 spinners, but we have 2 wicketkeepers. Makes me wonder what one-dimensional players like Morgan \u0026amp Vince (\u0026amp Roy!) are doing in the side.” Morgan is NOT one-dimensional. Captain, batsman, fielder, and if anyone should take some drugs, moral compass.Afghanistan are taking this seriously. They’ve got their president to come along – Ashraf Ghani. He looks grave, as if thinking about the fact that they haven’t scored 200 yet. Neither the Queen nor Theresa May seems to be there to join him. You’d think at least one of them would have some time on their hands.“Yesterday’s game marked the halfway point in the robin robin phase,” says Chris Parker in Durham, “and barring a monumental balls-up by one of them (Eng losing 3 of their 5, or NZInd losing 4 of their 5), we know that the current top 4 will be the final top 4 and the remaining 22 games will basically be about deciding which order they’re in. I know the TV companies will be happy, but it’s not a great format is it?” No, although it’s not the format’s fault that the middling teams – South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan – have come disguised as minnows. And as we’re only half-way through, there is still time for things to change, isn’t there? Jason Roy has been talking to Sky about his hamstring. “Minimum ten days,” he says. Once he trots back to the dressing-room, Nasser Hussain points out that England haven’t said what grade it is, which makes him suspicious that it’s a grade-two, “and that’s usually two to four weeks”.An email! From Ross Hall in Trafford, Manchester, of all places. “Love the fact,” says Ross, “you’re counting Root as a spinner now!” Yes, perhaps flattering him a little. Should I have said two and a half spinners?It’s Vince for Roy, as expected, and Moeen comes in for Liam Plunkett, who has had stomach trouble. So England have four seamers (Woakes, Archer, Wood, Stokes) and three spinners (Rashid, Moeen, Root). Eoin Morgan is fit to flip a coin. He wins the toss and chooses to bat first, for once in his life.Morning everyone and welcome to the 24th match in a World Cup group stage that is like Celine Dion’s heart: it will go on. Today England face Afghanistan for the first time ever (warm-ups aside) on English soil. It’s a meeting that promises more geopolitical intrigue than competitiveness – although, after Bangladesh’s thrilling demolition of the West Indian quicks, reversals are back in vogue.Old Trafford may have ends named after seam and swing bowlers, but it offers just what the spinner ordered – bounce and turn. On Sunday, on the same strip that will be used today, Kuldeep Yadav of India produced a near-wonderball to bamboozle Babar Azam of Pakistan. Afghanistan, with the excellent Rashid Khan leading a pack of twirlers, could bowl 40 overs of spin, and England’s big-hitters are quite capable of being bewildered by it. Jos Buttler, a superstar against most bowling, has faced ten balls from Rashid Khan in T20 cricket, made four runs and been out four times.England are hot favourites but they have injuries to deal with. Jason Roy is out with a damaged hamstring, presumably to be replaced by James Vince, the well-known cameo artist. Eoin Morgan is a doubt after his back spasms, though personally I’d pick him even if he was on crutches, just to have his canny brain and icy nerve out there. But Morgan himself may take a different view and his place could go to Moeen Ali, which would relegate Joe Root, who took two wickets the other day, to the eighth bowling option. And there may well be an outing for one or both of the forgotten men, Tom Curran and Liam Dawson. We will know more after the toss, in about 25 minutes play starts half an hour after that, at 10.30am BST. The weather, by recent English standards, is positively balmy: just a 10pc chance of rain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f0ac4197c9f2ef590221fdcdc65a315560d3dc6/0_0_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f43b605ae9d4a7b5216b81a52379e1","title":"royal ascot 2019 day one live","story":"Apparently, betting was suspended on the Queen’s Hat Stakes after some punter had a grand on yellow! More from the soaraway Sun here ...It’s almost that time ... for the details of who will be in the royal procession down the centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called ‘Royal Ascot’, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage’s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary.The British Council described the work thus: ‘Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen’s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen’s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol’s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his ‘Reigning Queens’ series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.’It’s raining ... and our snapper Tom Jenkins has captured the action ...The most obvious betting move this morning is that Too Darn Hot, beaten on both of his starts so far this year including in the Irish 2,000 Guineas last time, has replaced Phoenix Of Spain, who beat him by three lengths at The Curragh, as the favourite for the St James’s Palace Stakes, Tuesday’s feature event.Too Darn Hot was the top-rated juvenile last year, earning the same rating as the great Frankel at the end of his two-year-old campaign. Unlike Frankel, however, he has not progressed at all so far this year. John Gosden, his trainer, has blamed himself for choosing the wrong path through the early months of the campaign after Too Darn Hot suffered an injury which kept him out of the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, and also feels that his colt is as well as he has had him all year ahead of this race. But even so, the money that has forced him down to 9-4 clear favourite at the top prices in the market, with Phoenix Of Spain out to 5-2, seems to bear little relation to this season’s form.Mustashry briefly displaced Le Brivido as favourite for the opening Queen Anne Stakes this morning but they are now joint-favourites at 11-2, while last year’s 33-1 winner, Accidental Agent, is on the drift and out to 14-1 from 12-1 overnight. There is currently a clear favourite in the Coventry Stakes too, with money arriving for Aidan O’Brien’s Arizona (11-4 from 3-1 overnight) and Threat, who was also 3-1 overnight, now out to 100-30 and even 7-2 in a place. Bookmakers at the track are fighting shy of the blue wave too as everyone wants to be on that colour for the Queen’s Hat Stakes at 2pm ...Bit early with this today as there is already news of a ‘plunge’. Apparently blue is the colour and there is word of the bookies suspending betting after that colour was backed to be the Queen’s choice this afternoon. I spoke to royal reporter Robert Jobson who told me: “Only Angela Kelly, her designer, the Royals and their guests know the colour of her hat.” A Bookmakers.TV spokesperson said: “The market on the colour of Her Majesty’s titfer is a unique one in that without the guide of the exchanges odds compilers have to roll back the years and bet to their opinion which gives rise to differing favourites in a quickly moving market. “For long running fans of the royal meeting the speculation is an essential part of the day but newer audiences, less likely to be consuming the spectacle as a whole off course, are seemingly less interested. Still, the popularity of the market - which serves primarily as a PR excercise - in sections of the media is showing no sign of waning which is music to the ears of Royal Ascot purists.“As for day one, the vibes are Her Majesty will opt for a blue number and if that materialises the market vibes will have been spot on. The other two colours we are likely to see this week are green and white, which Her Majesty has worn 11 times since 2005.” Last night William Hill were betting: 3-1 Blue, Pink, 4-1 Green, 6-1 Yellow, 7-1 Purple, 8-1 White, 14-1 Orange, 25-1 Black, Brown and Red. If I get some updated betting I’ll post it here.Sir Michael Stoute 79Aidan O’Brien 65John Gosden 47Mark Johnston 43Saeed bin Suroor 36Paul Cole 21Mick Channon 18Dermot Weld 17David Elsworth 16Roger Charlton 10James Fanshawe 10Wesley Ward 10Aidan O’Brien seeks to be top trainer here for the 10th time, having come out on top for the last four years, during which time he and Ryan Moore have come to dominate the thoughts of Ascot punters. Sir Michael Stoute’s four winners last year finally secured him the all-time record among trainers, carrying him clear of the mark of 75 set by Sir Henry Cecil. He has been top trainer here six times, most recently in 2014, while John Gosden has done it just once, in 2012.Mustashry, fancied for the Queen Anne, is Stoute’s only runner on Day One. Gosden is busier with four, including two of the top three in the betting for the St James’s Palace Stakes. But all Flat trainers are jealous of Aidan O’Brien, who gets to saddle 11 runners today, though only Arizona is likely to start favourite.Big claim this ...Frankie Dettori 60Ryan Moore 53Jamie Spencer 26William Buick 23Olivier Peslier 16James Doyle 10The last person other than Ryan Moore to be top jockey at Royal Ascot was ... ? Yes, Johnny Murtagh in 2013, you knew that. Moore has come out on top here for the last five years and eight times in all, a Piggott-esque period of dominance. He’s 8-11 for a repeat.Dettori, a 3-1 shot this time, has been top jockey here five times but not since 2004. His four winners last year was a spirited effort for a man in his late 40s who likes to take it easy. Actually, that’s unfair on the strength of today’s card, since the Italian has got himself a ride in every race, as (more predictably) has Moore.Here’s how the big two match up for rides today. Moore has the better strength in depth but Dettori has the best chance in Too Darn Hot. He’d be especially sick to see Moore going past on Circus Maximus, as Dettori rode that one in the Derby a fortnight ago.2.30 Dettori: Hazapour 9-1Moore: Le Brivido 6-13.05 Dettori: Light Angel 20-1Moore: Arizona 3-13.40 Dettori: Imprimis 12-1Moore: Sergei Prokofiev 10-14.20Dettori: Too Darn Hot 9-4Moore: Circus Maximus 14-15.00Dettori: Batts Rock 12-1Moore: Buildmeupbuttercup 13-25.35 Dettori: Star Of Bengal 10-1Moore: Magic Wand 5-1If you fancy someone else to ride most winners this week, the best odds available are: 5-1 James Doyle, 20-1 Jim Crowley, 33-1 Silvestre De Sousa, 40-1 Oisin Murphy and Donnacha O’Brien, 66-1 or bigger the rest.You want to know what’s going to win, right? Here are our tipster Chris Cook’s selections for the first day. Stay here and we’ll have an in-depth preview from Chris for every race as the afternoon goes on.The overnight weather and going report from Ascot is that it was dry overnight, as it has been since Sunday morning, though there is still a forecast of possible thundery showers from late morning until tomorrow.The GoingStick readings are interesting: stands side 8.9, centre 8.9, far side 8.7 and the round course 7.4. That suggests the round course is a fair bit slower than the straight, but also that the straight is borderline good-to-firm.The only non-runner so far today, incidentally, is The Cashel Man in the Ascot Handicap at 5.00.

There are six races at Ascot today and you must post a single selection for each race.If you don’t win today, don’t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Royal meeting, up to Friday.And post your tips or racing-related comments below the line.My first big gamble of Royal Ascot week was taking the train to the course despite all the warnings of chaos thanks to a strike on South West Trains, co-incidentally called for the busiest week of the year on the Waterloo-Reading line.The result? Well, it might be a little different on the way home this evening but thus far, it’s a winner, on the 09.28 from Clapham Junction at any rate. Betting-wise, I should probably quite now while I’m ahead. But it won’t be easy with the best five days of the Flat season now just a few hours’ distant.The Tuesday card at Ascot is the one that is often referred to as the purist’s afternoon at the Royal meeting, which is another way of saying that it is top-loaded with three of the meeting’s eight Group One races and also tends to attract the smallest crowd of the five days.The scheduling remains a bit of a puzzle, as it means that almost half of the week’s biggest events have been run by 4.15pm on the first afternoon, and in terms of boosting the live audience for the showpiece races, it might make sense to shift one of the Group Ones towards the end of the week. Change is glacial at Royal Ascot, though, and the counter-argument is that Thursday to Saturday will sell out in any case. The status quo keeps the purists happy too.My colleague Chris Cook’s tips for the opening day are here, while punters might like to know that pool betting with the Tote promises to offer a little more value this year as an alternative to the bookmakers.This year’s meeting marks the debut of World Pool, a co-mingling exercise between the Tote’s UK operation and the hugely popular pari-mutuel system in Hong Kong. Tote bets placed in either jurisdiction will go into the same pot, which should ensure much stronger pools and therefore more certainty for punters that they will be getting fair odds for their money when the idend is declared. Nothing, after all, puts a punter off the Tote more thoroughly than a 33-1 winner that pays £16.60 on the machine.There are a few minor caveats. The Hong Kong tote cannot support races with more than 25 runners, so the Royal Hunt Cup and Saturday’s Wokingham, probably the two biggest betting races of the week, will have only a local pool. It might also not be the best way to back one of this week’s runners from Asia - Lim’s Cruiser goes in the Diamond Jubilee on Saturday and Deirdre, from Japan, runs in tomorrow’s Prince Of Wales’s Stakes. But for a sport looking for ways to boost its income from betting, World Pool does offer a small sliver of hope.The Queen will be arriving at around 2pm BST and the first race, as ever, is due off at 2.30pm. As yet, there is little sign of the thunderstorms that were threatened in the overnight forecast – though of course, it’s in their nature to pop up from nowhere – and ground is officially good and good-to-soft in places on the round course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3d18224580fa0df8f40eab30e94c8f12da34de/0_121_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918a1c6e970026c0fea982538091e4e9","title":"libra facebook cryptocurrency new digital money transactions","story":"Digital currency will let billions of users make transactions but is raising privacy concerns•Facebook’s Libra launch will extend its global domination•All you need to know about Facebook’s new cryptocurrencyFacebook has announced a digital currency called Libra that will allow its billions of users to make financial transactions across the globe, in a move that could potentially shake up the world’s banking system.Libra is being touted as a means to connect people who do not have access to traditional banking platforms. With close to 2.4 billion people using Facebook each month, Libra could be a financial game changer, but will face close scrutiny as Facebook continues to reel from a series of privacy scandals.It could also be a welcome lift to Facebook’s profits: analysts are suggesting Libra could be a huge moneymaker for Facebook, arriving as its growth slows.Technology to make transactions with Libra will be available as a standalone app – as well as on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger platforms – as early as 2020. It will allow consumers to send money to each other as well as potentially pay for goods and services using the Facebook-backed digital currency instead of their local currency.But with the company in the crosshairs over multiple privacy violations, the move is already attracting scrutiny from financial regulators and privacy advocates across the world. Facebook is currently facing a potential $5bn (£4bn) fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which opened an investigation in response to the Cambridge Analytica revelations first reported by the  and Observer.“It is important to understand how large social platforms make data available that can be used in ways that have big implications for consumers’ financial lives,” the letter said. “It is also important to understand how large social platforms use financial data to profile and target consumers.”Facebook executives claim the Libra system will help the many millions of people without bank accounts but with access to mobile phones to enter the banking world and to more seamlessly send money.While Facebook created the currency, decisions regarding the ongoing maintenance of the Libra platform will be carried out by the Libra Association, a collective of dozens of financial, not-for-profit companies, and commerce firms. To join the new Facebook subsidiary, each of these companies contributed a minimum of $10m to the venture, giving the company more than $1bn to put towards the new currency.Companies involved include Mastercard, PayPal, the crypto exchange Coinbase, and eBay. Also joining the Libra Association are ride hailing startups Uber and Lyft and non-profit financial organisations Women’s World Banking, micro-loan platform Kiva, and humanitarian aid group Mercy Corps. The foundation will be headquartered in Geneva and Facebook claims it will be independent from governments and the company itself.In a document outlining how the new cryptocurrency will work, Facebook said its goal is to foster more access to “better, cheaper, and open financial services”. Unlike bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Libra is tied to a mix of global assets to prevent the level of volatility common in the digital currency space. Facebook built the currency on its own blockchain technology – the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – in order to scale to more users more quickly.Traditionally with cryptocurrency, the network can be run and secured by anyone with a computer access. But initially, Libra’s blockchain will be closed, and only a select number of people will be able to run the software that powers it and verify transactions.A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset that relies on a peer-to-peer network of users. Sharing many of the features of traditional currencies, crypto assets can be used as a medium of exchange and a store of value for users.Cryptocurrencies rely on so-called distributed ledger technology, which enables the authentication of transactions without them needing to be handled or guaranteed by a central authority. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs.If you own a crypto asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours.If you spend it you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain.Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies, and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, surging in value as investors piled in, drawing comparisons with the Tulip mania of the 17th century before it crashed in 2018. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto assets ideal for criminals and terrorists.\u0026nbspThe number of crypto assets available has grown rapidly, including from several major companies. JP Morgan has built its own cryptocurrencies, while trading in traditional financial assets that track the value of cryptocurrencies – such as derivatives and contracts for difference – have also become available. Richard PartingtonThe company has been quietly padding its staff with ex-PayPal executives and crypto experts for years, and its entry into the digital currency space threatens to potentially upset traditional banking institutions. Facebook claims it aims to supplement existing institutions and allow users who may have access to mobile devices but not bank accounts to enter the banking ecosystem, citing its partnerships with Women’s World Banking and other non-profits.“These kinds of groups will help us improve on the mission of financial inclusion – in the long term this project will be seen as a financial utility,” said Kevin Weel, vice-president of product at Facebook. “This has no intention of substituting itself for the large central banks.”The platform will roll out over the next year with the goal of users being able to send money on it by 2020. Cryptocurrency advocates say a company as large as Facebook entering the space is a huge gain for adoption of the technology. Bitcoin entered the world more than 10 years ago, but very few people use it on a daily basis, said Jerry Brito, the executive director at Coin Center, a Washington DC not-for-profit cryptocurrency advocacy group.The company faces a number of potential regulatory roadblocks before it can reach consumers. In April 2019, Zuckerberg met the with Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the US Treasury to discuss the payment system and potential regulation surrounding it.The company claims it will not attempt to bypass existing regulation but instead “innovate” on regulatory fronts. Libra will use the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use and will implement automated systems to detect fraud, Facebook said in its launch. It also promised to give refunds to any users who are hacked or have Libra stolen from their digital wallets.Facebook claims financial transactions will remain siloed from social media activity and that user ad profiles will not be based on Libra habits, but critics say the new project has a number of privacy implications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7e6922279d59e22a8206007eef863980c998cc/648_572_3704_2223/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59ea1e55f4577020b0ff22d72d273f74","title":"samsung galaxy s10e review the cheaper one","story":"Smallest, cheapest Samsung flagship has most of what makes the S10 line good, but with a flat screen and one camera fewerThe Galaxy S10e is Samsung’s attempt to offer a flagship smartphone experience in a smaller body and at a lower cost, which mostly works.The formula is simple: take the same processor, reduce the memory a little and squeeze it into a smaller, less complicated body.The AMOLED screen is only 5.8in on the diagonal, only FHD+ and only flat, not curved at the edges. Whether any of those are downsides depends on your view of curved screens. The display isn’t visibly worse than the S10, and it still has the hole-punch notch through which the selfie camera pokes.The display is covered in last year’s Corning Gorilla Glass 5, not 6 as fitted to the regular S10, so it might be a little less scratch resistant or prone to smashing on impact.With rounded metal sides and glass front and back, it looks fairly simple in design terms. Get it in prism white or canary yellow and it’ll stand out from the crowd. The S10e is easy to hold onto at only 69.9mm wide and 142.2mm tall, which makes it one of the smallest flagship phones on the market alongside Google’s Pixel 3.In reality it doesn’t feel all that smaller than the S10 because it’s only 0.5mm narrower and 7g lighter.There’s the lesser-spotted headphone socket in the bottom, next to the USB-C port, and the phone is water resistant to IP68 standards: 1.5m depths of up to 30 minutes.The Galaxy S10e has the same processor – the Samsung Exynos 9820 in the EU or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in the US – as the larger, more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+.The cheaper phone has only 6GB of memory compared with 8GB, but most will likely not notice, as performance was pretty much the same. Only on occasion would an app have to reload when brought back from the recently used apps list.That means the S10e is as fast and fluid as most of the competition, even if it doesn’t quite manage OnePlus 7 Pro-levels of speed.Battery life on the S10e was a disappointing 25 hours between charges, the same as the regular S10. With the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 9am on day two, which might be enough to get you into work.That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.You will likely have to charge it before a night out so it’ll get you home the other side. Charging is pretty slow too, taking 95 minutes to fully charge via cable and similar via 15W wireless charging. Wireless powershare works well, but is fairly slow – fine for charging a set of headphones.The Galaxy S10e runs the same new One UI version of Android 9 Pie as the rest of the S10 line, and is a big improvement on previous versions of Samsung’s customised Android experience.Most of the changes have been made to make using a large phone easier, but given the smaller size of the S10e, they’re less of an improvement. Still, everything looks good and works well. The only area where Samsung is clearly behind the curve is the gesture navigation. Its swipe pads work fine but are harder to reach and less fluid than the competition. I ended up sticking to the traditional navigation buttons.You’ll get about three years of software support from Samsung, but Android version updates will be slower than some of the competition, meaning Android Q will likely only arrive in excess of six months after its release.Unlike the rest of the S10 line the Galaxy S10e has a traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the power button. It’s fast, accurate and lines up with roughly where your right thumb rests on the side of the phone where you would normally push the power button.But it’s harder to use in your left hand. I found that it was placed too high up on the right side to comfortably hit it with my left index finger in a natural position taking several attempts to unlock the phone.If you’re left handed and want to use a fingerprint scanner, think twice about the S10e.One of the areas where the S10e is inferior to its more expensive siblings is in the camera. There is only two cameras on the back, not three. Still, the main 12-megapixel camera is joined by the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, leaving zoom to pure digital, which is noticeably worse than the S10 or S10+.That means the S10e is capable of capturing some really good standard and wide-angle shots, with good detail and colour range. It certainly isn’t the best camera on the market, but it keeps up with most of the competition short of the zoom.The selfie camera is excellent so is video capture. And there are plenty of modes, including manual “Pro” mode and a dedicated Instagram camera, to play with.With the Galaxy S10e Samsung has mostly managed to condense what is good about its 2019 flagship S10 line into something smaller and cheaper.It’s full of good, but not quite the best features. The screen is great, the camera is good but has no optical zoom, the fingerprint scanner is fast but awkward for left-handers and while performance is great, battery life is a bit weak.The S10e’s £669 RRP isn’t that cheap either, when companies such as OnePlus offer better specifications in similarly built phones for £169 less. With the regular S10 already available for similar money, but with a better camera and in-display fingerprint, the S10e becomes less palatable.But the Galaxy S10e is a good phone, which will be even better when bought on a deal. If you hate curved screens but want a top-end Samsung, then this is the phone for you.Pros: great screen, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, good camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, dual-sim optionCons: battery life could be better, relatively slow charging, low-light performance not as good as rivals This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Will Viv Rook, the populist prime minister of 2029, succeed in disappearing every refugee and member of the working class? Will radical activist Edith Lyons stop Rook in her tracks, succumb to radiation poisoning, or do both at the same time? Will Edith’s no-good brother Stephen discover a conscience, or at least get some colour in his cheeks? And as for Stephen’s daughter, Bethany, whose brain has been plugged into the internet by the Home Office will her Three-Eyed Raven-style powers solve the problems of humanity, or at least help us switch energy providers?We soon shall see. A six-part drama by Russell T Davies, Years and Years is a bold mashup of at least three different genres – kitchen sink drama, near future sci-fi and state-of-the-nation polemic – and it has juggled the requirements of each form effectively. You care about the characters, believe in the futuristic inventions (such as “the blink”, a stick that disrupts wireless communications) and recognise the political tensions that pit parts of the Lyons family against each other. Furthermore, it’s all done with a lightness of touch that stops you from dwelling too long on any less convincing aspects (why did Daniel get on that boat?).As you might expect, coming as it does from one of Britain’s best creators, Years and Years has been good TV. But its most powerful quality is not one you would necessarily shout about on a billboard. What this serial has managed consistently is to create a sense of dread one that burrows its way under your skin and stays there, pulsing away day and night.Years and Years starts today, in 2019, and speeds through the upcoming decade and a half with things falling apart as it goes. This pacing is the first thing that contributes towards the tension there are few if any scenes in which an awful event or its consequences are not being felt. You don’t get much time to relax.It also helps that the material for this dystopia is so close at hand. Most obviously, there is the ascent of Rook, a leader not far removed from Nigel Farage (they share a hairstyle), but whose common touch incorporates a very British diffidence and a willingness to act silly, to turn a political event into something more like a wedding speech. Rook, as played by Emma Thompson, convinces as the next possible mutation in our febrile politics.It also feels highly plausible that, 10 years down the line, climate change will have reduced the UK to one big soggy mess. In the 2028 of Years and Years, the country endures 60, no 80, consecutive days of rain. We are informed of this development by the standard alternate reality device of a news broadcast within the show. But we also learn of awful news through incidental dialogue between characters. We hear that chocolate has become a luxury and that there is no longer such a thing as a banana. The offhand way this information is shared only adds to the unease as the viewer notes the gap between the way the characters are behaving and the significance of what is happening to them.There’s also the experience of having to watch the characters act against their own best interests. The youngest Lyons sibling, Rosie, is hard up and in a wheelchair thanks to spina bifida, but also becomes Rook’s most ardent fan. As the final episode begins, however, she is imprisoned in her estate, a victim of Rook’s social and ethnic cleansing.So many of the little fearful aspects of Years and Years ring true. They come together to form something persistent in the pit of your stomach. The most unsettling thing of all is the one that might also give you hope. It’s the fact that, despite everything that happens to them, the Lyons family just carries on. At one point, for example, Stephen loses his high-paying job in a banking crash and becomes a member of the benighted gig economy. He has to maintain as many as eight jobs, most of which involve riding a bike, but at the end of the day he still has time to betray his family by having an affair with a colleague. The ability to remain focused on our own little worlds is equal parts reassuring – we cannot be destroyed! – and depressing – we’re just like cockroaches!Davies came up with the idea for Years and Years some time ago and he says he has had the final scene in his head for 25 years. If that’s the case, the chance of it providing a happy ending against all the odds seems slim. It remains likely that some, if not most, of the eerie forecasts contained within this drama will never happen. Rather than disappearing beneath the waves, the UK may yet build a new Jerusalem. But if the worst does happen, Years and Years will have served as good preparation. That sinking feeling will at least not come as a surprise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59a762130b26f81e32d2ea48fc1c20717ecbd98/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833045bc8665932cc39bfe06ce2ab01f","title":"us to send 1000 additional troops to the middle east citing hostile behavior","story":"Tensions between countries on the rise after Washington blamed Tehran for attacks on oil tankersThe US is sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East in response to “hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups”, Patrick Shanahan, the acting defence secretary, announced on Monday.The move further heightens tensions between the two countries. Last week Washington blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tanker ships, which came more than a year after Donald Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal and restoring economic sanctions.“I have authorized approximately 1,000 additional troops for defensive purposes to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East,” Shanahan said in a statement.“The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region.”The acting secretary added: “The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. The action today is being taken to ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and to protect our national interests.”Officials told the Associated Press the deployment included security forces and troops for additional surveillance and intelligence gathering and was among options initially laid out to US leaders late last month. Those options included as many as 10,000 troops, along with Patriot missile batteries, aircraft and ships.As relations worsen, Iran also said on Monday that it would soon breach limits on how much enriched uranium it can stockpile under the nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said this amounted to “nuclear blackmail”.Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the state department, told reporters on Monday: “We continue to call on the Iranian regime not to obtain a nuclear weapon, to abide by their commitments to the international community.“It’s unfortunate that they have made this announcement today. It doesn’t surprise anybody and this is why the president has often said that the JCPOA needs to be replaced with a better deal.”The US decision to pull out, and Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy, appears to have damaged trust with allies, some of whom are seeking stronger proof that Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday: “Yes, we’ve shared it with allies already. You’ve had the chance to see it. I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday, I’ll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite against this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran.”On Monday, the Pentagon released new images it said showed Iran was behind the attack on one of the ships. The case rests on an unexploded limpet mine on the Kokuka Courageous tanker ship that the US says was removed by Iranians on a patrol boat.“Iran is responsible for the attack based on video evidence and the resources and proficiency needed to quickly remove the unexploded limpet mine,” the Pentagon said in a statement accompanying the imagery.Critics, meanwhile, accuse the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis. Ben Rhodes, former national security adviser to Obama, tweeted: “Trump pulling out of the Iran Deal has led directly and predictably to the Iranian nuclear threat getting worse and the risk of war going up.”Democrats urged caution and called for the White House to provide an explanation. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said: “Americans must have no illusions about the Iranian regime, and must remain committed to holding Iran accountable for its dangerous activities in the region. But we must be strong, smart and strategic – not reckless and rash – in how to proceed. The Congress must be immediately briefed on the administration’s decisions and plans.“This deeply concerning decision may escalate the situation with Iran and risk serious miscalculations on either side. Diplomacy is needed to defuse tensions, therefore America must continue to consult with our allies so that we do not make the region less safe.”On Tuesday China urged restraint, saying the US risked “opening a Pandora’s Box” in the Middle East.State councillor Wang Yi said, “the US side should alter its extreme pressure methods. Any unilateral behaviour has no basis in international law”, and warned that it could create “an even greater crisis”. Wang also urged Iran not to abandon the nuclear deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfa188d257a3043bbe44105c081b3891c3fcb95a/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc15e2e74ebcbb47e8362d512ad0b3f0","title":"madrid new rightwing council suspends low emissions zone","story":"Protests planned as People’s party rolls back key policy of Spanish capital’s former mayorMadrid’s new rightwing city council has begun rolling back one of the flagship initiatives of the last mayor three days after taking office by in effect shutting down the Spanish capital’s low-emissions zone.The plan, known as Madrid Central, covers 472 hectares (1,166 acres) and was intended to cut nitrogen dioxide levels and put people at the centre of the city’s transport thinking.It was one of the most high-profile policies of the capital’s previous mayor, the leftwing former judge Manuela Carmena, and has proved popular with residents, visitors and environmental groups.But the scheme has been attacked by the conservative People’s party (PP), which now runs Madrid after agreeing a deal with the centre-right Citizens party and securing the backing of the far-right Vox party.The new PP mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, has made good on his threat to “address” the issue of Madrid Central.From 1 July, the city council will no longer fine people for taking more polluting vehicles into the zone. However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed.“It’s very clear that it’s reducing pollution and has been adopted very willingly by people,” said the group’s co-ordinator, Paco Segura. “A lot of organisations and social collectives are mobilising because people are beginning to wake up to the advantages of having fewer cars.”Segura said protests would be held over the coming days to stop the council abandoning the scheme and make Madrid the first European city to scrap a major urban low-emissions zone.“This is stubbornness on the part of the city council, which said it would take action on this despite the fact that it flies in the face of all logic and common sense,” he said. “This is a case of pure party politics being placed before people’s health.”The move has also been questioned by Martínez-Almeida’s deputy, Begoña Villacís of the Citizens party. She acknowledged the PP and Vox wanted to scrap Madrid Central but counselled against such drastic action.“We don’t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,” she told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this week. “Now it’s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don’t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be. But I don’t think a total reversal is the option.”Spain’s increasingly fragmented politics is leading parties into awkward and potentially unstable coalitions across the country.On Monday, Citizens parted company with the former French prime minister Manuel Valls, whom it had backed to oust Ada Colau as mayor of Barcelona. Although Valls threw his weight behind a coalition between Colau’s far-left grouping and the Catalan Socialist party – thus stopping the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left from taking over city hall – he has been a fierce critic of Citizens’ decision to work with Vox.Tensions between Valls and the party’s leadership have been tense since they disregarded his calls for a cordon sanitaire against the far-right and instead sought Vox’s backing to govern the southern region of Andalucía in coalition with the PP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecf150f15419c373e65f1d3f6eddb1192144893b/64_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc763715977d8fac105a44162fb35d4f","title":"photograph melting greenland sea ice fjord dogs water","story":"Research teams traversing partially melted fjord to retrieve weather equipment release startling pictureRapidly melting sea ice in Greenland has presented an unusual hazard for research teams retrieving their oceanographic moorings and weather station equipment.A photo, taken by Steffen Olsen from the Centre for Ocean and Ice at the Danish Meteorological Institute on 13 June, showed sled dogs wading through water ankle-deep on top of a melting ice sheet in the country’s north-west. In the startling image, it seems as though the dogs are walking on water.The photo, taken in the Inglefield Bredning fjord, depicted water on top of what Olsen said was an ice sheet 1.2 metres thick.His colleague at the institute, Rasmus Tonboe, tweeted that the “rapid melt and sea ice with low permeability and few cracks leaves the melt water on top”.Olsen tweeted that his team relied on traditional knowledge from local hunters and their dogs as they searched for dry spots on the ice.

The DMI weather station nearby at Qaanaaq airport registered a high of 17.3C last Wednesday and 15C last Thursday, which is high for northern Greenland, even in summer. Mottram cautioned that the numbers were provisional and would be subject to checking.In other areas, meltwater drains away through fractures in the ice to the rocks far below, and so does not leave standing water on the surface. But because the ice in the region is thick and fracture-free, the water pools above the ice, giving rise to the dramatic photograph.Melting events such as the one pictured would normally not happen until later in the summer, in late June or July. Mottram said it was too soon to say what role global warming had played, because although these temperatures were unusual, the conditions were not unprecedented and “still a weather-driven extreme event, so it’s hard to pin it down to climate change alone”.She said forecasts indicated that the warm conditions over Greenland would persist at least for another few days, so the dog-sled teams will face further tough going.

It also recorded Arctic ocean temperatures of 2-4C above the average.“The melting is big and early,” Jason Box, an ice climatologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told the Washington Post.At a local level, the sea ice melt provides significant problems for communities in Greenland, who rely on it for transport, hunting and fishing.“Extreme events, here flooding of the ice by abrupt onset of surface melt, call for an increased predictive capacity in the Arctic,” said Olsen."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3929221.1560847116!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"photograph offers window on melting greenland sea ice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSled dogs wading through standing water on the sea ice during an expedition in Northwestern Greenland, in this June 13th photograph taken by Steffen Olsen of the Centre for Ocean and Ice at the Danish Meteoroligical Institute.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA new scheme for managing ersions on the M50 is to be fully in place in the coming weeks, transport planners say.First announced in November 2016, the emergency ersion routes had to be agreed with Dublin’s local authorities in a process that took more than two years.The ersions come into play only when a major incident closes part of the M50. Traffic will be erted from the motorway onto way-marked routes through the suburbs to the point where motorists can rejoin the M50.The way-marks being used to identify the ersions are a series of black symbols – squares, triangles, circles and diamonds – on yellow backgrounds.Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council is the final authority to fit the symbols to its road signs and the process is expected to be completed in coming weeks, a spokesman for road builder Transport Infrastructure (TII) said.The signage will identify ersions along the M50 and nearby sections of its feeder routes, such as the M1, N2, N3, N4, N7 and M11.A similar system is being considered for the Cork Ring Road, the M40.In the event of a major incident, motorists will see a message on overhead electric signs advising them that the motorway is closed. The electronic display would tell them which symbol to follow. Gardaí would also be on duty and the motorway operator would also use social media and radio to help inform drivers of what was happening.The move is in response to a major disruption caused by serious incidents on the M50 including an incident in 2015 at the N4M50 junction which caused traffic gridlock lasting several hours and led to calls for better contingency planning.TII developed the ersions after looking at similar systems in the UK and in association with the Interagency Incident Co-ordination Group, which includes representatives of An Garda Síochána, Dublin Fire Brigade, the four Dublin local authorities, TII and the Motorway Traffic Control Centre.The system has, as yet, been used only twice. The first time was at the junction of the M50M1 in 2016 when a major crash closed the junction, and the second was this May when a lorry and a bus collided on the N7, near the M50.TII said in both incidents traffic had been erted effectively with the aid of the overhead signs, the new symbols, the gardaí, radio and social media.He said the system was intended to only be used in the event of major emergencies when all resources would be deployed to ease traffic onto and off the ersion.In 2002 new traffic signs featuring junction numbers and inner as well as outer circles were scrapped after then minister for transport Séamus Brennan said motorists were bewildered.

Photograph: Alberto PezzaliNurPhoto via Getty ImagesConservative party members would be prepared to sacrifice the union, destroy their party or suffer economic damage to get the UK out of the European Union, a poll has suggested.The YouGov survey of party members – who will decide the next prime minister – suggests that almost half (46 per cent) would be happy to see the Brexit Party’s Nigel Farage as their new leader.Despite the strong support for Brexit, even if it had major repercussions, Conservative and Unionist Party members indicated they would be prepared to call it off rather than see Jeremy Corbyn enter Number 10.The survey found that 63 per cent of members would be prepared to see Brexit take place even if it meant Scotland leaving the UK.Some 61 per cent would rather Brexit took place even if it caused “significant damage” to the economy, 59 per cent would prioritise leaving the EU even if it meant Northern Ireland breaking away from the rest of the UK, and 54 per cent would accept the Tory party “being destroyed” in order to secure Brexit.But only 39 per cent of the members who responded to the question said they would want Brexit to take place if it meant Labour leader Mr Corbyn becoming the next prime minister, with 51 per cent saying they would rather the UK did not leave the EU in order to avoid that happening.The survey also found 26 per cent of Tory members would be happy to see Scotland leave the UK, as would 20 per cent be if Northern Ireland did so, regardless of the Brexit issue.YouGov’s Matthew Smith said: “Conservative members are not just ideologically committed to Brexit – they also genuinely believe that the failure to deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum will bring about the destruction of the party’s electoral chances.“By contrast, most members believe that successfully bringing about Brexit will win the Tories at least the next election.”Another survey from Opinium found that a third of those who watched at least some of the Channel 4 leadership debate on Sunday thought Rory Stewart performed best.Jeremy Hunt was second on 18 per cent, Dominic Raab third on 10 per cent, Sajid Javid had 9 per cent and Michael Gove was last with 6 per cent.Among Tory voters who watched the show, 24 per cent thought Mr Stewart triumphed, narrowly ahead of Mr Hunt on 22 per cent. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Scientists say that data collected from the yellow submarines\u0027s first expedition will help them build more accurate predictions in order to combat the problem.The mission has uncovered a key process linking increasing Antarctic winds to higher sea temperatures, which in turn is fuelling increasing levels.Researchers found that the increasing winds are cooling water on the bottom of the ocean, forcing it to travel faster, creating turbulance as it mixed with warmer waters above.Experts said the mechanism has not been factored into current models for predicting the impact of increasing global temperatures on our oceans, meaning forecasts should be altered.Boaty McBoatface – the publicly named robotic submersible carried on the research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough – took its first expedition in April 2017, studying the bottom of the Southern Ocean.The three day mission saw Boaty travel 112 miles (180 kilometres) through mountainous underwater valleys The three-day mission saw Boaty travel 112 miles (180 kilometres) through mountainous underwater valleys measuring the temperature, saltiness and turbulence of the water at the bottom of the ocean, at depths of up to 4,000 metres.In recent decades, winds blowing over the Southern Ocean have been getting stronger due to the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and increasing greenhouse gases.The new data, along with other ocean measurements collected from research vessel RRS James Clark Ross, have revealed a mechanism that enables these winds to increase turbulence deep in the ocean, causing warm water at mid depths to mix with cold, dense water in the abyss.The resulting warming of the water on the sea bed is a significant contributor to rising sea levels.The mission was part of a project involving the University of Southampton, the National Oceanography Centre, the British Antarctic Survey, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Princeton University.Sir David Attenborough presses the launch button for the RSS Sir David Attenborough, which the public voted to name Boaty McBoatfaceResearch leader Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato from the University of Southampton, said: “Our study is an important step in understanding how the climate change happening in the remote and inhospitable Antarctic waters will impact the warming of the oceans as a whole and future sea level rise.”Dr Eleanor Frajka-Williams of the National Oceanography Centre said: “The data from Boaty McBoatface gave us a completely new way of looking at the deep ocean – the path taken by Boaty created a spatial view of the turbulence near the seafloor.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

dog eyes evolutionary trick manipulate humans say scientists","story":"Dogs have evolved to manipulate humans with their eyes, scientists claimThe next time a dog looks up at you with those big, soppy eyes and your heart begins to melt, be aware: you are being manipulated by 33,000 years of evolution.That is the conclusion of a new scientific study which argues that the raised eyebrows so beloved of owners are more of a survival strategy than an expression of friendship.The clues, its authors argue, lie in a comparison with wolves, which dogs began evolving from after they were first domesticated by Stone Age man.Anatomical analysis reveals that while modern dogs have developed small muscles around the eyes which allows them to raise their inner eyebrows, wolves possess hardly any comparable muscles.Such a stark ersion in what in evolutionary terms is a short period of time has led the researchers to believe that humans naturally favour canines able to look at them with big “puppy dog” eyes, giving them a selection advantage.Their findings complement previous studies which suggest that big eyes trigger a caregiving response in humans because it reminds them of babies.Scientists already know that dogs’ ability to read human behaviour and emotion is almost unique within the animal kingdom, and there is growing evidence that eye contact is crucial to this.Dr Juliane Kaminski, who led the research at the University of Portsmouth, said: “The findings suggest that expressive eyebrows in dogs may be a result of humans\u0027 unconscious preferences that influenced selection during domestication.“When dogs make the movement, it seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.“This would give dogs, that move their eyebrows more, a selection advantage over others and reinforce the ‘puppy dog eyes’ trait for future generations.”Scientists already know that dogs’ ability to read human behaviour and emotion is almost unique The researchers dissected the facial anatomy of four wild grey wolves and six domestic dogs, focusing on a region of muscle they called Action Unit 101.They found stark differences in muscle fibre concentration between the species.The team also compared the behaviour of live wolves and dogs when exposed to humans for two minutes, finding that the dogs raised their inner eyebrows more and at a higher intensity than wolves.“This is a striking difference for species separated only 33,000 years ago and we think that the remarkably fast facial muscular changes can be directly linked to dogs’ enhanced social interaction with humans,” said co-author Professor Anne Burrows, who led the anatomical research at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh.A study in 2015 showed that a shared gaze between humans and dogs results in a hormonal response in both parties similar to that between a mother and baby.Two years earlier, scientists proved rescue dogs were more likely to find an owner if they raised their inner eyebrows.Surveys have also shown that humans tend to favour dogs with infant-like characteristics such as a large forehead, as well as eyes.“The AU101 movement is significant in the human-dog bond because it might elicit acaring response from humans but also might create the illusion of human-like communication,” said Dr Kaminski.The new research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

This can lead to stunting in children, who then go on to suffer cognitive delays, weakened immunity and disease. Pregnant women who lack micronutrients are more likely to have babies with defects or low birthweight.Potato is a staple crop in many parts of the world and researchers at the International Potato Centre (CIP) in Peru believe that a biofortified variety could have an important role to play in improving diets.After rice and maize potato is the third most consumed food in the world so increasing its micronutrient content would make a significant difference to people’s health around the globe, said Dr Oscar Ortiz, director of the CIP.Stunting | A silent emergency threatening millions of young lives“Potato already has proteins, iron, zinc and vitamin C and it is also an extremely good source of fibre. It’s a well balanced food if consumed boiled or baked. But we can make it even better,” he said.Potatoes may have developed an image problem in recent years with the move to “low carb” diets but Dr Ortiz believes this is mainly because of the way they are consumed as chips or fries.Work on biofortification of the potato began in 2004 as researchers looked through a gene bank of around 200 varieties from countries around the Andes - where the potato originated.Researchers identified 16 native varieties with high levels of iron, zinc and vitamin C and then spent more than a decade crossing these types with each other to produce varieties with even higher levels of micronutrients.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionThese were then crossed with other types of potato with high yields and good resistance to disease such as blight. These varieties have 40 to 80 per cent more iron than types currently grown in the Andes.Now these potatoes are being tested to see if they grow in other parts of the world: clones are being grown in Rwanda and Kenya and will soon be introduced to Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.Researchers are also conducting bioavailability testing to see whether the increased iron content of the potato is absorbed by the human body. Once this is confirmed Dr Ortiz believes that the new varieties will be available within the next two years.“If we can confirm this, which is a critical milestone, the potato will be available in 2021,” he said.Studies show that consuming 600g of these potatoes a day, as is common in most areas of the Peruvian highlands, could provide up to 75 per cent of the recommended daily allowance of iron and zinc.“We are not saying only eating potato will solve the iron deficiencies of the world but it will be part of a erse diet where other sources of nutrients are needed,” he added.CIP’s approach has already been tested with sweet potato fortified with vitamin A – groundbreaking work which in 2016 won the World Food Prize, the “Nobel prize” for food.New research has shown that since 2013 more than 2.3 million households in Africa and Asia have been given sweet potato cuttings to grow themselves.New green revolution | £100m to fund \u0026#039super-crops\u0026#039“Their work has shown that 120g of sweet potato a day can provide 100 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A intake. It’s a really good example of how biofortification can contribute to reducing micronutrient deficiency,” said Dr Ortiz.The biofortified sweet potato also contains high levels of vitamins B6 and C, manganese and potassium.Dr Ortiz added that fortifying food at source was better than doing it during the production process. The UK government has announced it intends to fortify flour with folic acid to reduce the number of babies born with spina bifida or anencephaly, where the majority of the brain never develops.“If it becomes part of the diet and is consumed every day it is a much more sustainable way of accessing micronutrients. Sweet potatoes and potatoes are cultivated by vulnerable people who are far away from governments so having these crops is a better option for them,” he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityTory leadership vote news: Stanley Johnson warns against \u0026#39Eton v Eton\u0026#39 shortlist as Rory Stewart gathers momentumBrexit extension inevitable if the new Prime Minister wants a different deal, says former UK ambassador to the EU Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizMan who attacked Nigel Farage with milkshake admits assault chargeSouth Western Railway train strike: Services cancelled and carriages over-crowded as latest RMT action begins   Indian stuntman dies after trying to replicate Houdini river escapeRory Stewart denies being a spy for MI6 - but admits he is prohibited by law from saying otherwiseHong Kong extradition bill will remain suspended says Carrie LamRory Stewart: the \u0026#39Florence of Belgravia\u0026#39 years, and the portrait that set him apart from his Eton peersComment: Public interest cannot be served by putting a dying man through the dock, with little chance of convictionIron Man suits for the military on horizon following creation of 3D printed body armourNorth Korea talks designed to give Xi Jinping and Kim  Jong-un new leverage over USTeachers are \u0026#39too scared\u0026#39 to discuss Empire, director saysUK weather: Fears of further flooding as yellow thunderstorm warning issuedComment: Labour\u0026#39s latest tax squeeze is a declaration of war on parental love Gurinder Chadha: \u0026#39British schoolchildren aren\u0026#39t even told there was an Empire\u0026#39Comment: Today is the real test for Rory Stewart, the exotic insider who sees Brexit as a national mistakeHeathrow reveals \u0026#39masterplan\u0026#39 as it launches public consultation over expansionUnited Nations says it suffered \u0026#39systematic failure\u0026#39 dealing with Burma\u0026#39s Rohingya crisisComment: \u0026#39People power victory\u0026#39 in Hong Kong looks more like a tactical retreatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/17/TELEMMGLPICT000193761949_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"gurinder chadha british schoolchildren arent even told empire","story":"Arts and Entertainment EditorBritish children are no longer taught about Empire because well-meaning educationalists are “frightened” of discussing the subject, Gurinder Chadha has suggested.The British-Indian director of Bend It Like Beckham was talking ahead of the launch of her new ITV series, Beecham House, which is set in 18th century India and follows the exploits of a former officer with the East India Company.Chadha’s last project, Viceroy’s House, explored Partition and the end of Empire through the eyes of Lord and Lady Mountbatten. But she worries that the history is unknown to schoolchildren today.“Most children in British schools aren’t even told now that there was an Empire, that the British ruled India,” she told Radio Times. “Of course, it’s wrong.”Asked if that was because educationalists want to avoid giving offence in multicultural classrooms, Chadha replied: “Yes, they’re frightened of telling the truth.”Gillian Anderson and Hugh Bonneville as the Mountbattens in Viceroy\u0026#39s HouseBeecham House provides a benevolent view of the men of the East India Company, with the French portrayed as the villains of the era as they vied for control of the country’s trade.Chadha, who wrote and directed the drama, explained: “History is how you interpret it. I’m sure there will be historians who will take issue because what I’ve made is a drama, not a documentary. If I wanted to be 100 per cent accurate, I’d make a factual series for the History channel.“This is Sunday night drama. You can’t lie, but you can look at what’s been presented in the past and offer an alternative interpretation.”She added: “It’s an adventure and a love story. But - hopefully - if you’re open to it, a story about today. Because John is an immigrant, looking for a better life. And it’s about nationhood, so it has obvious connections with now.“The most exciting thing is simply having Indians in period costumes on primetime British TV - where their lives and loves are as important as their white counterparts. That’s a flipping radical thing. That’s something I’d never have imagined seeing when I was watching The Jewel in the Crown.”Beecham House, which begins on Sunday, is set in 18th century IndiaIn an effort to turn her leading actors into screen heart-throbs, Chadha encouraged Tom Bateman and Leo Suter (who play brothers John and Daniel Beecham) to go shirtless. “So we’re competing with Poldark!” she said, adding that she had reframed one shot after “realising, when looking down the lens, how ripped one of the actors’ bodies was when he took his shirt off”.The series has also been dubbed “the Delhi Downton” because it looks at the lives of characters above and below stairs. Much of the series was shot on location in Rajasthan and Chadha said one of her biggest problems was finding horses that could perform.She said: “In Britain, we have period-trained horses that do things like pulling carriages. In India, horses are polo ponies. So, in 99 per cent of scenes where there are horses and carriages, the horses wouldn’t pull anything.“If we do another season, we need to either send the horses to drama school, or put some on the boat from the UK.”Tory leadership vote news: Stanley Johnson warns against \u0026#39Eton v Eton\u0026#39 shortlist as Rory Stewart gathers momentumBrexit extension inevitable if the new Prime Minister wants a different deal, says former UK ambassador to the EU Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizMan who attacked Nigel Farage with milkshake admits assault chargeSouth Western Railway train strike: Services cancelled and carriages over-crowded as latest RMT action begins   Indian stuntman dies after trying to replicate Houdini river escapeRory Stewart denies being a spy for MI6 - but admits he is prohibited by law from saying otherwiseHong Kong extradition bill will remain suspended says Carrie LamRory Stewart: the \u0026#39Florence of Belgravia\u0026#39 years, and the portrait that set him apart from his Eton peersComment: Public interest cannot be served by putting a dying man through the dock, with little chance of convictionIron Man suits for the military on horizon following creation of 3D printed body armourNorth Korea talks designed to give Xi Jinping and Kim  Jong-un new leverage over USTeachers are \u0026#39too scared\u0026#39 to discuss Empire, director saysUK weather: Fears of further flooding as yellow thunderstorm warning issuedComment: Labour\u0026#39s latest tax squeeze is a declaration of war on parental love Comment: Today is the real test for Rory Stewart, the exotic insider who sees Brexit as a national mistakeHeathrow reveals \u0026#39masterplan\u0026#39 as it launches public consultation over expansionUnited Nations says it suffered \u0026#39systematic failure\u0026#39 dealing with Burma\u0026#39s Rohingya crisisComment: \u0026#39People power victory\u0026#39 in Hong Kong looks more like a tactical retreatCambridge Union audience laughs at anti-Semitic \u0026#39joke\u0026#39 by Malaysian prime ministerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18 june 2019","story":"HM Queen Elizabeth II leaves the the Order of the Garter Service in Windsor, England.

It’s hard to reconcile with the man I knew. But it’s the necessary conclusion,” the unnamed pilot told The Atlantic.As a senior officer and examiner it would have been easy to ert co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, , out of the cockpit and then lock the door, the pilot said.“All he had to say was ‘Go check something in the cabin,’ and the guy would have been gone,” he said.The fellow pilot speculated that the mental state of Shah’s could have been a contributing factor to his decision.Married captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, , sent -year-old sisters, Lan Qi Hui and Qi Min Lan messages, begging them to come to Kuala Lumpur.His  Facebook messages have been revealed as psychologists claim he was self-destructive.He sent the Malaysian twin sisters sexually suggestive messages.On one occasion he commented under a picture of Qi Min Lan in a bathrobe with the comment: Just showered He repeatedly asked the girls when they were coming to his hometown, despite being ignored.Zaharie also used his Facebook to call Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak a moron.He also slammed the government which owned the airline he flew for.Zaharie urged his followers: There is a rebel in each and every one of us. Let it out!Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas said he should have been fired for his political rants.He told Australias Daily : It should have raised serious alarm bells with the airline that you have someone flying who has such strong anti-government views.If a Qantas pilot did something like that, he would be spoken to and grounded.The co-pilot was Fariq Abdul Hamid, , who was on his first flight on a  as a fully approved first officer.He had flown five times before with a check co-pilot overseeing him.But he had , hours experience flying other jets before moving to the larger aircraft.Fariq was reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with  people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Captain Ross Aimer, a former United Airlines pilot, believes lithium-ion batteries in the cargo of the plane ignited before setting the plane on fire.The fire could have then spread killing both the pilot and co-pilot before they had a chance to save the aircraft.It has recently been claimed the engine of the plane has been found in the Cambodian jungle."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scrap tv licenses oap","story":"It would be dead without those of us who remember Top Of The Pops, Blackadder, Harry Carpenter, Boys From The Blackstuff, Kenneth Wolstenholme, the Dimblebys, The Likely Lads, Monty Python’s Flying Circus and the Hairy Cornflake.By stupidly scrapping free TV licences for .million people aged over , the BBC just burst its own golden bubble. You silly old Auntie! Despite the BBC’s unapologetically anti-Brexit bias, millions will go to the grave with a soft spot for the Beeb.But the brutal truth is that young adults born this century do not give a damn about the BBC. My -year-old daughter and her generation have no contact with the corporation.These kids think David Attenborough is that nice old man saving the planet on Netflix. They are big on BuzzFeed. They get their ­entertainment from YouTube, Netflix and Instagram.Even Facebook and Twitter seem horribly old hat to these teenagers. The BBC inspires no love at all in the millennial heart. To these st Century sprogs, born with a smart phone in their hand, the idea of paying £. a year to the BBC is absurd.Increasingly, it seems absurd to even those of us who fondly remember Bill And Ben, The ­Flowerpot Men. The licence fee is a telly poll tax from another century.The BBC only gets away with raking in a total of £billion a year in licence fees because of the generations who grew up when the BBC was the only show in town.The BBC was extremely foolish to show older ­viewers such wanton ­disrespect. Because now some painfully dficult questions are being asked of the broadcaster.Why does the BBC need to send hundreds of its staff to groove at Glastonbury every year  Does Gary ­Lineker REALLY deserve an eye-watering £,, per annum And why does ANYONE need to pay the licence fee in a world of Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Sky, BT and the infinite ersions of the internet Is there ANY place for a compulsory TV tax  Yes — the last century! The BBC has committed an epic act of self-harm. It was also a crass miscalculation by greedy BBC bosses to announce they were cancelling free TV licences for the over-s just one week after the nation honoured the generation who paid for our liberty with their youth, their blood and their lives.Victor Gregg,  years old, is a former prisoner of war who spoke for the nation. “It’s only days agowere patting all these old people on the head and calling them heroes, this generation which has saved the world,” said Victor.“These are the people now who are over . They’ve lived their le. They’re knackered.”Will the BBC prosecute ­Normandy veterans and their elderly widows for non-payment of the licence fee  Not a great look.And what a sickening prospect that any poor or vulnerable person could be prosecuted for not ­stumping up £. a year to finance the bottomless BBC trough.The BBC’s mugging of the over-s is a wake-up call for us all. This bloated, arrogant corporation has been indulged, protected and bankrolled for too long.The fat cats at the BBC need to tighten their bulging belts. Sky-high salaries need to come down. Grotesque waste — like the annual BBC beano to Glastonbury — has to be cut back.The BBC’s expansionist digital empire needs dialling down. Profligate BBC bosses must start to live within their means. £billion a year is plenty. And, yes, we need to start a national debate about the relevance of the licence fee in the modern world.And above all, the BBC needs to start showing some respect to the older citizens of this country. Because this breaking news just in.Nobody  is watching.JOKING about throwing battery acid in someone’s face is exactly like joking about rape. It will never – and can never – be funny, no matter how much you disagree with the views of the person who is being raped or disfigured by acid.Luckily for Jo Brand, she did not recommend throwing battery acid at a Labour MP or a member of an ethnic community. They would never have let her inside Broadcasting House again.But because Jo only joshed about throwing battery acid at right-wing politicians, her paydays at the BBC are safe.And although Brand was investigated by the police, I suspect the BBC now loves her even more.The comic insists she was joking and would never encourage anyone to throw battery acid at a politician for daring to have views that Jo disagrees with, likewe should possibly respect democracy and leave the EU.What a relief. And I will say this in Jo’s defence – I never saw anyone less likely to throw away a calorie-stuffed milkshake than this cruel, unfunny, virtue-signalling fatberg. Just kidding, Jo!And can we please stop referring to the children abused in Haiti as “prostitutes”  What happened with those girls in Haiti, some as young as  , was not prostitution. It was survival sex.If you are starving in a disaster zone, you do not have sex with a middle-aged charity worker for money. You do it to stay alive.AFTER Michael Gove’s cocaine confession, Boris Johnson was mocked for saying that he was not sure that he actually took the drug.But the scary truth is that nobody ever really knows what they are putting up their nose because this stuff is not regulated.It comes with no list of ingredients. There is no quality control. Cocaine is routinely cut with talcum powder, icing sugar and worse.Anyone who takes “cocaine” might believe they are on the real-deal Bolivian marching power, but you simply never know.It could easily be rat poison you are putting up your hooter. That is why I always warn my children that they should never touch cocaine with a barge pole, or indeed a rolled-up fiver.THE Cannes Film Festival was agog at the sight of ­Vietnamese model Ngoc Trinh, who rocked up to the premiere of A Hidden Le, Terrence Malick’s painfully po-faced film about a conscientious objector in World War Two, wearing a mere rumour of a little black dress.Since ing to Vietnam, Ngoc has been heavily criticised by the Vietnamese government, who have launched an enquiry into whether she violated the country’s public decency laws.“I don’t carepeople criticise it because I felt pretty in the dress, which made a good impression on the Cannes red carpet,” said Ngoc.The Vietnamese authorities should give the girl a break. She is a fine ambassador for their wonderful country. And her dress is almost certainly a lot more interesting than Malick’s sombre three-hour film.DANIEL CRAIG was trying hard to look cool and Bond-like when he hobbled through New York’s JFK airport in a foot brace and on crutches.Bond  – the working title of the next  film – has had a run of rotten luck. A director who quit. An explosion on set. Agonising over the script.  with a walking stick. By the time Craig, , recovers, his co-star Rami Malek has other filming commitments.“You can’t have a Bond film where  does not come face to face with the villain so it’s a complete nightmare logistically,” said one insider.Even this torrential rain has buggered things up for the production as Pinewood Studios, Bucks, was trying to pass itself off as sun-drenched Cuba.

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview. Channel  imagining it was doing us some sort of favour by replacing the brilliant Gogglebox regulars with witless minor celebrities.And The One Show’s Matt Baker telling Clare Balding that women’s football is: “Much better than the men’s game.”Suggesting Matt Baker’s either never seen a game of football in his le or he’s a disingenuous creep who’ll say absolutely anything he thinks will help him grovel his way up the BBC career ladder. Pitul behaviour.ITV’S England v Soccer Aid XI match was more entertaining and funnier than expected, largely thanks to Mark Wright’s penalty miss and Ant Middleton’s above-the-knee sock arrangement, which I think was meant to give him the graceful air of Thierry Henry, but actually just looked more like Lord Percy from Blackadder II was playing at right back.So why then did commentator Clive Tyldesley choose to cheapen the occasion by questioning Piers Morgan’s ethnic credentials for managing the victorious World XI, when tests have already confirmed he’s so authentically Irish  per cent of his DNA can be traced directly to Mayo, the other quarter to chips Paddy McGuinness’ and Freddie Flintoff’s first Top Gear already looking like a vast improvement on all the other post-Clarkson versions.BBC’s landmark Thatcher: A Very British Revolution series.

but MPs rejected it in January.MPs rejected the deal two more times causing Mrs May to fail to meet the deadline of March .European Council President Donald Tusk agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until October , but MPs are keen to leave before that.Mr Tusk agreed to the extension on the condition that the UK stands in the European Parliament election, which were held May -.Theresa May failed to push her withdrawal agreement through ParliamentOn March , MPs dramatically rejected crashing out of the European Union without a deal at any time and under any circumstances.Politicians voted  to  to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.But, its not a legally-binding decision, and doesnt rule out the UK leaving the bloc.On May , Mr Tusk said thatthe  referendum was held again that Brits would back Remain.The European Council president vowed to press EU leaders to delay our exit yet again beyond October  to give enough time for a fresh vote to be held.Theresa May has vowed to block any chances of Boris Johnson achieving a No Deal Brexit by joining forces with Remainer pals Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, it has been reported.Allies of Mrs May revealed she also voted for Remainer Rory Stewart in Thursdays ballots - which Mr Johnson won by a landslide.Mrs May has reportedly suggested forming alliances with the Chancellorand Pensions Secretary to thwart Mr Johnsons attempts to have the UK leave with no deal after the October  deadline.Mr Johnsons landslide victory means his opponents are being forced to decide to jump on his bandwagon or continue to fight him in the race to Downing Street.Despite Mrs May failing to secure the Commons backing on her Brexit Deal and ultimately leading to her downfall, she is hell-bent on ensuring the UK does not leave the EU without a deal.She said she will stay as an MP for Maidenhead after she leaving No next month.MPs voted to delay Brexit until at least June .The European Commission has warned Parliament that voting against Brexit happening without a withdrawal deal in place isnt enough and that MPs must approve the deal, too.An official from the EUs executive branch said on March  that the bloc had already reached a orce deal with May, yet the House of Commons rejected it – twice.The PM had said it would be unacceptable to take part in the elections, more than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU.The PM was hoping she can pass a Brexit deal with the help of Jeremy Corbyn, but ultimately cross-party talks collapsed.Brexit is now extended until October  so Britain can figure out a way to end the deadlock.On May , Mrs May made a speech saying she was stepping down as PM.Her resignation has triggered a Tory leadership race which is set to begin after she stands down on June .She will stay in office until July when a new party leader will have been chosen.Jeremy Corbyn said The House has definitely ruled out no dealBrexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Michel Barniers deputy Sabine Weyand has just been appointed as the EUs top trade official. Her promotion means that she will be in charge of the nuts and bolts of negotiating Brussels’ future trade deals, including with the UK.On June , a poll showed that about  per cent of Brits are less concerned with leaving the EU without a deal than previously thought.Ministers have previously announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Ministers also unveiled the post-Brexit immigration system, which will end preferential treatment for EU migrants.Theresa May’s Government was plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.In December , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.As bitter Brexit battles raged on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers showed:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tonight at pm,  Conservative MPs will announce whoaposs been knocked out in the second round of voting for our next Prime Minister. Anyone with fewer than  backers will be ditched as MPs whittle six candidates down to just two by Thursday.Boris Johnson , Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove look likely to get through to the next round. But Dominic Raab , Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid all look like they could be vulnerable.Whoever survives will face a one-hour BBC debate from pm - the first TV showdown to include Boris Johnson. Here are  things you need to know about the latest twists and turns this Tuesday morning.    Surprise star of the race Rory Stewart faces new questions over whether he was an MI spy. Yesterday the Old Etonian ex-diplomat, a former private tutor to Princes William and Harry, outright denied heaposd ever worked for MI. But a Whitehall security source told the DailyMr Stewart was hired by the Secret Intelligence Service as a aposfast trackapos entry after he left Oxford University. The source claims he left after seven years at the agency - where Thealso reported Mr Stewartaposs father was second in command from  to . Today Mr Stewart admitted that,he had been a spy, the law would prevent him answering the question honestly. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: “No. And in fact the law wouldn’t allow newspapers to reveal the identity of intelligence officers.” Asked to confirm he couldn’t answer the question, and could merely say he served his country, Mr Stewart said: “I definitely would say I served my country. “Andsomebody asked me whether I was a spy I would say no.” He also told BBC Breakfast: I was not a spy. I am very very proud to have served my country. Asked to confirm a spy wouldnapost say he was a spy, he replied: That’s always the problem with that question and you’ve put your finger on itapos.    Rory Stewart was never expected to get through the first round. Now heaposs won the backing of deputy PM David Lidington and Justice Secretary David Gauke - and could survive tonightaposs cull. The surprise popularity of the anti-No-Deal candidate has sparked a backlash from his Tory rivals. Michael Gove today said it would be a mistake to give , Tory members a vote on two candidates who polarise the party. This is thought to mean Boris Johnson, whoaposs said heaposll leave the EU on October  deal or no deal, versus Mr Stewart who has ruled out No Deal.Writing in The Times, Mr Gove said backing Brexit is hared by the vast majority of the Conservative Party’s membership.   So it would be an error to put forward candidates who don’t share that belief. They simply won’t win the confidence of the Conservative voluntary party. Rival Sajid Javid also blasted Mr Stewart over his background - studying at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, just like Boris Johnson. Mr Javid told the BBC: If we end up in a situation where the final two, three, four even are people from similar backgrounds with similar le experiences, it would look like a debate at the Oxford Union. And I just don’t think that’s healthy for the Tory party. One Tory MP even claimed Boris Johnsonaposs team are trying to actively sabotage Rory Stewartaposs bid for office by lending votes to rival Jeremy Hunt. The MP told The Sun: MPs on Borisaposs team are looking at lending Jeremy votes. Boris has so much headroom he can be a master manipulator. Itaposs like something out of s Chicago. And given itaposs a secret ballot thereaposs no way of stopping it.   Tory leadership chicken Boris Johnson will finally break cover on Tuesday night after dodging grillings.The wannabe Prime Minister snubbed a C debate on Sunday and a hustings with political journalists yesterday – but will now join his Tory rivals on TV in a BBC debate.Leadership hopeful Rory Stewart , who bookies now rank second to frontrunner Mr Johnson, yesterday slammed his previous no-show.He said: “He doesn’t as far as I can see have a plan. I say as far as I can see as he doesn’t talk to the public.”And Michael Gove said: “Someone put it to me these hustings without Boris was like Hamlet without the Prince. Of course, at the end of Hamlet he isn’t the king.”Despite the lack of public face it seems Boris - backed by former candidate Andrea Leadsom this morning - is ploughing ahead with plans for power. Nicknaming him aposChairman Borisapos, thetoday reports he is expected to sack a third of Mayaposs Cabinet to purge mainly Remainers from his top team. Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond and David Gauke are all said to be at risk. As is Brexiteer - but hapless - Transport Secretary Chris Grayling.    Chancellor Philip Hammond is prepared to resign over Theresa Mayaposs plans to spend billions of pounds on projects to shore up her legacy, itaposs reported today. Government sources told the Press Association that tensions between Treasury and No officials have reached boiling point over the PMaposs splurge. Mr Hammond is said to be so against the plans that he is prepared to quit the Government in what would be an extraordinary move just weeks before the PM leaves office. Tensions have surfaced over Mrs Mayaposs intention to spend up to £ billion per year over three years on education, totalling £ billion, including plans to build new schools and pay teachers higher wages, the well-placed source said. The Chancellor is thought to be particularly angry that the plans could tie the hands of her successor, which the source said was immoral and irresponsible. Everyone knows this Government is coming to an end and ministers are desperately trying to shore up their legacy by splashing the cash, they told the Press Association. Not only is it immoral to take away the choices of the next PM, itaposs irresponsible - especially as no-deal looms. An ally of the Chancellor told the Mirror: Over the last three years, multiple reports of Chancelloraposs impending resignation have proved to be premature. . Letaposs just put Liam Gallagher in No     Well, things canapost get much worse than they already are. So why not give a crack at Oasis star Liam Gallagher  He tweeted this morning: My name is liam Gallagher I have  beautul children I have dabbled in drugs over the years I’ve had many number s. Now send me the keys to no I’ll sort this pile of s*** out. WHY ME WHY NOT. Sounds pretty convincing to us.

Charlea Venters and partner Bradley Belding booked an overnight stay at the hotel in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester, during their trip to the city to attend the British Soap Awards earlier this month. aposEastenders-obsessedapos Charlea got the tickets as a birthday treat and was excited to rub shoulders with the great and good from the soap world on June . But ahead of the star-studded evening the couple checked-in to their £ double room and claimed they had to get the bed sheets changed after discovering the brown streaks, which she believes was faeces. Salon owner Charlea, , said this was only part of a catalogue of stomach-churning discoveries, which also allegedly included aposdried semenapos on the sofa bed and a apospoo-streakedapos toilet bowl with pubic hair on the seat. Have you had a horrible hotel experience  Get in touch with us on webnews@trinitymirror    Grim footage shows the couple complaining to reception over the phone about their toilet discovery, only for Charlea to be left in fits of laughter as Bradley, , picks up a piece of cooked bacon off the carpet as he hangs up. But after the grisly discovery in their bed, the horried couple headed to reception before midnight to demand a refund but said they were told it couldnapost be processed that evening. They claim the receptionist said they could either stay and apply for a refund in person in the morning or leave and request money back through the website. The pair, who faced a three-hour trek home, opted to stay in the en suite room but claim to have slept badly due to the condition of the room. A Premier Inn spokesperson said their stay was aposcertainly not in line with our usual high standardsapos and issued a full refund on June .  Charlea, from Holbeach, Lincolnshire, said: It was absolutely horrendous. I felt like I wanted to go home, put all my clothes in the wash, have a bath and scrub myself - it was horrible. I picked Premier Inn because I thought it would be convenient. Our plan wasnapost to stay very long at the hotel. It was just to get there late in the afternoon and then go back in the morning - though not quite as early as we expected. I wasnapost expecting a big place with a spa but I was expecting very basic but clean [facilities], which I donapost think is too much to ask. Premier Inn is a name you feel you can trust. For years theyaposve done that advert on television that says aposeverythingaposs Premier but the priceapos. I can see why it was quite expensive purely because of where we were and there was quite a big event on, but at the same time I do feel that was a lot of money for what we received.    Charlea claims their stay started off badly after they pulled up in a aposlitter-strewnapos car park, which appeared to be littered with discarded silver nitrous oxide canisters. After checking in Charlea went to unpack her toiletries when she discovered the uncleaned toilet that appeared to contain aposskid marksapos and pubic hair on the seat. Seconds after coming off the phone to complain to reception baffled lorry driver Bradley then sat down on the bed when he spotted a piece of cooked bacon on the carpet. Charlea later answered a knock at the door and discovered the receptionist, carrying a bucket and cleaning products, who announced he would be cleaning the toilet. Charlea said: The car park looked like a landfill site, there was loads of litter and those silver canisters. We did wonder whether it was going to be safe to leave the car there. As we checked in the receptionist told us our room number - thataposs when it went downhill even more. I remember walking into the room and thinking apositaposs not too badapos, it was quite basic but looked alright. I got my toiletries and took them into the bathroom and thataposs when I saw pubic hair and skid marks in the toilet.  I didnapost put my make-up bag down, showed Bradley and then he got on the phone to reception. The receptionist said aposno problem we will come and clean itapos. When he said that I didnapost think he meant he would do it - where was the cleaner  I feel by leaving reception unattended anyone could have walked in that hotel and got to any of the rooms, they could have been carrying whatever they like. In the video I started laughing, it wasnapost the fact I found it funny I just couldnapost quite believe what was happening. As they were getting ready for the glitzy event Charlea was stunned to discover a crusty white substance on the roomaposs sofa bed, which she believes was semen. Charlea said the aposcherry on the topapos of their stay was finding the apospoo marksapos on the sheets as they were about to clamber into bed. Charlea said: As soon as we pulled back the quilt and saw that it was just the cherry on the top - thankfully we hadnapost got into bed. I think it was the same that was in the toilet. It was disgusting, I just didnapost feel clean. Iaposd already found a white stain on the sofa bed. It didnapost look very good, I think it was dried semen. By this point I didnapost know whether I wanted to be sick or go home first. My bags were already half packed as I didnapost want to take my stuff out of the bags after knowing what a state it had been in there.  The couple got dressed and headed to reception and claimed they were offered the opportunity to stay in their room and request a refund at the desk in the morning or leave and apply online for their money back. Charlea said: I didnapost want to be there because itaposs filthy but it would mean driving through the night, which might be a bit of a risk. We thought it would be a hassle to get a refund online so we decided to stay with the new clean sheets on the bed. I couldnapost properly settle even with new sheets, I didnapost feel clean and I couldnapost stop thinking what might have been happening outside in the car park. Charlea said the receptionist at the desk on Sunday morning told them that refunds could only be processed online - something she found frustrating as the only reason they decided to stay was to get a refund in person. Charlea said: Itaposs so frustrating and annoying, thereaposs no way that room had been cleaned or inspected beforehand. It was either missed or hadnapost been cleaned as there were used bed sheets on there and thick dust on the wardrobe.  It totally ruined the weekend. We didnapost sleep properly as we were constantly thinking aposgod this is disgustingapos. I will never stay with Premier Inn again. Iaposd already booked to stay in a Premier Inn before this happened but paid more so there was no cancellation fee. Iaposm going to go down the cancellation route as I canapost bear to go through it again. A spokesperson for Premier Inn said: We were sorry to hear about Ms. Ventersapos experience which is certainly not in line with our usual high standards. The complaint was received on rd June and, after a full investigation by our senior team, a full refund was given on the th June. None of our hotels is able to process refunds on site which is why our team member requested that Ms. Venters contact our head office. Ms. Venters did accept the offer of a complimentary breakfast at the time of making her complaint. Our investigation has reassured us that processes are in place to ensure that this hotel is operating to the highest standards of cleanliness. With regard to occasions when there is no team member present at reception, we can assure all guests that robust security technology prevents non-guests from gaining entry beyond public areas.

The TinyPi Pro device, was alleged to have broken commerce policy and was prevented from reaching its destination as a result.

Cyclist Robert Hazeldean is set to pay out thousands in damages and court costs after being sued by Gemma Brushett, . Garden designer Mr Hazeldean was ing from work in central London to his then home in Archway when he collided with Ms Brushett as she crossed the busy junction of King William Street and Cannon Street, at the north end of London Bridge, at pm on July , . Both he and Ms Brushett, from Kent, were knocked out by the impact, with Mr Hazeldean suffering cuts and Ms Brushett a minor head injury.    She subsequently launched a bid for compensation, blaming Mr Hazeldean, who now lives in southern France, for the accident. Judge Shanti Mauger at Central London County Court said the cyclist was a calm and reasonable road user and that Ms Brushett was looking at her phone when she walked into the road in front of him. But she went on to rule that Mr Hazeldean was liable to pay damages, saying: Cyclists must be prepared at all times for people to behave in unexpected ways. The court heard that Ms Brushett, who works for a finance firm in the City as well as running yoga retreats, was one of a throng of people trying to cross the road at the start of rush hour when the accident occurred. She was looking at her mobile phone when crossing the road from east to west, and only noticed Mr Hazeldean approaching at the last moment. She panicked and tried to dodge back to a traffic island, but the cyclist, who had been travelling at between -mph, swerved in the same direction and hit her.    Mr Hazeldean had come through a green traffic light, and had sounded a loud airhorn attached to his Specialized roadbike, as well as shouting, swerving and braking in a bid to avoid the pedestrian. Ms Brushettaposs lawyers told the judge that she could not remember anything about the crash due to post traumatic amnesia. However she relied on the evidence of another cyclist who had witnessed the crash and confronted Mr Hazeldean immediately afterwards. That witness had made a voice recording at the time, accusing Mr Hazeldean of aggressive riding and calling him arrogant and reckless. Three other pedestrian witnesses however backed Mr Hazeldean, telling police that Ms Brushett was not looking where she was going and that the cyclist was not at fault.    Mr Hazeldean himself in the witness box said that as he approached the spot where people were crossing, there was a large patch of clear road, although some people were still on the extreme left hand side of the carriageway about to step onto the pavement. Ms Brushett was one of these, but having looked up from her phone screen at the last minute upon hearing him shout she panicked and darted back towards the right and into his path. Judge Mauger said Mr Hazeldean was courteous and mild-mannered and gave every impression of being a calm and reasonable road user. She rejected the account of the crash by the other cyclist, adding: The other witnesses feel that the accident was Ms Brushettaposs fault. Mr Hazeldean is clear that she was looking at her phone as she was crossing the road, she continued. Three other witnesses said she stepped out or that the cyclist could not avoid her. I find that she was looking at her phone and I accept the account of Mr Hazeldean that she turned and went back towards the central reservation.    But she went on to find that Ms Brushett deserves a payout. When I stand back and ask aposhow did the accident happen apos it seems to me that Mr Hazeldean owed a duty to other road users to drive with reasonable care and skill, she said. Even where a motorist or cyclist had the right of way, pedestrians who are established on the road have right of way. Mr Hazeldean did fall below the level to be expected of a reasonably competent cyclist in that he did proceed when the road was not completely clear.  But she added that Ms Brushettaposs conduct as a pedestrian must have contributed to the accident. Ms Brushett must clearly have equal responsibilityshe is crossing the road without looking - andshe is looking at her phone, even more so, she said. But cyclists must be prepared at all times for people to behave in unexpected ways. The appropriate finding is that the parties were equally responsible and I make a finding of liability at  . The result of the judgeaposs ruling is that Ms Brushett is now guaranteed a payout, but will only get half of the full value of her claim. The case willto court at a later date for costs and damages figures to be fixed.

With increasingly regularity ramblers at Scoggins Valley Park in Washington, USA were coming across a male baby bear. The public began taking the curious mammal to heart, leaving left overs for the lb bear. On Tuesday Washington County Sherfaposs Office and the Oregon Department of Fish received two calls about the bear after it came in contact with large crowds gathered at Henry Hagg Lake for boating. Conscious of the danger even a young bear can pose to humans, the authorities tweeted a warning to the public, urging people not to be drawn by its sweet looks or to pose for selfies with him, as numerous people had.    Biologists Kurt License and Doug Kitchen were sent down to the scene to trap and remove the bear, only to find him eating a selection of trail mix, cracked corn and sunflower seeds left by visitors to the park. The animal declined to run away when the two wildle men approached.“This is a classic example of why we implore members of the public not to feed bears,” Mr Licence told Oregon Live.   “It’s never a good idea to feed wild animals. “They are perfectly capable of fending for themselves, and it’s always better to leave them alone and enjoy them from a safe distance.” Mr Licence added that once a bear has been fed by humans the chance of problematic encounters increases because the animal associates people with food.    The decision was taken to shoot the bear which died of his injuries. Deputy Brian van Kleef of the Washington County Sherfaposs office said: Weaposre sad it ended this way. There have been three black bear attacks in Oregon since , with nine people killed across the USA by bears since .

But after talks broke down it hasnapost taken long for North Koreaaposs Kim Jong-un toto his crazy ways. According to reports, he recently executed one of his generals by throwing him into a fish tank full of flesh-eating piranhas imported from Brazil. The tank had been built specically in Kimaposs Pyongyang presidential palace for his new method of execution. Many believe he was inspired by the  James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, where villain Karl Stromberg kills his enemies by dropping them into an aquarium filled with sharks.    He we look at some of the other weird things that make crazy Kim the worldaposs craziest dictator... His real age is a mystery He is thought to be the worldaposs youngest ruler, but no one has any clue to Kim’s actual birthday. The the youngest son of the late supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, it is believed that he was either born in  or . The US Treasury Department, in , lists his birth date as January , , with some believing Kim prefers that people think he is older than he really is. He got the job because of his looks Kim was unveiled as the great successor to his dictator father in , when he was made a four-star general despite having NO military experience.    Reports claimed Kim was made the heir partly because he looks like Kim Il-Sung, the founder of North Korea. Some watchers even said the young Kim had had plastic surgery to increase the resemblance between them. Kim succeeded Kim Jong-Il to become the countryaposs new Dear Leader after his father died of a heart attack in December . He once ate too much cheese Kim fell in love with Swiss cheese when he was a student in Switzerland. The tubby leader has become hooked on Emmental, spending much of his day eating it in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.  His cheese addiction is believed to have caused him to balloon in size, and started to walk with a limp because of his condition. He has also sent envoys to France to try to enrol North Korean cooks on cheese-making courses. In , Kim reportedly had to briefly retreat from public le after eating too much Emmental cheese, after a large shipment of it arrived from Switzerland. He formed his own girl band One of the most famous girl bands in North Korea is called Moranbong. The band, known for their military unorm-style costumes, extravagant shows and synthesizer-backed anthems, were among the country’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea last year.  Kim founded the band himself in , and reportedly handpicked the group’s ten singers himself. A year later, the girls were all put on a regimented diet to standardise their waistlines, according to North Korea watchers Sino-NK. And not surprisingly, most of the girl band’s songs appear to be about the North Korean leader himself. “How can he be so kind,” the lyrics to one ballad go. “His smile is so warm and sweet. I have no choice but to be taken by him and his warm heart.” He loves basketball Kim supports the Chicago Bulls basketball team and Michael Jordan is one of his heroes.  The dictator also has a peculiar friendship with former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has been to visit Kim in North Korea several times. He once executed someone for falling asleep Kim was not pleased when his defence minister Hyon Yong Chol fell asleep during a military event. He accused him of treason and had him publicly executed watched by hundreds of state officials. It is believed he was blown apart after being fired on by six ZPU- anti-aircraft guns. He ordered North Koreans to cut their hair like his In  North Korean authorities issued an order requiring men to keep their hair no longer than cm, while woman were required to keep their hair bobbed. Young men have been told to model their hairstyle on the supreme leader’s own eccentric style, where the sides and back of the head are almost clean shaven and only the top is left.  Young men are supposed to wear their hair in a bobbed cut like Kim’s we Ri Sol-ju. Only performers are now allowed to grow their hair, according to reports. A Pyongyang source said that the order was being enforced in the country’s universities, where “university student monitors are walking around with scissors and cutting off the hair of offenders.” Kim himself, however, is believed to be scared of barbers, so he cuts his own hair. He has murdered his own family members In December  Kim ordered the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-theak, who was accused of crimes against the state. Those crimes including adultery, spending foreign currency at a casino when being treated abroad and dreaming alternative dreams to the rest of the North Korean population. He is said to have been executed by firing squad - although rumours circulated claiming he had been fed to a pack of wild dogs.  And in  he is believed to have ordered the assassination of his half-brother Kim Jong-nam, who was attacked with VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. A new book claimed this week that he was working as an informant for the CIA before the killing. He travels with his own toilet... Kim knows the stools can tell a lot about him, such as what he ate for lunch and any diseases he might have. So everywhere he goes he takes his own toilet with him.  It is believed the practise stems from the leader’s fear that foreign agents will use his stools to help their states take advantage of North Korea. ...but never has to use it Or at least that’s what the North Korean people have been told. Among the claims made by state media about Kim is that he doesn’t need to defecate or urinate, supporting the view that he is practically a god and supernatural in nature. In an updated biography of the North Korean leader sent to schools in , it was also claimed that Kim could drive by the time he was three, was winning yacht races at nine and was also an expert artists and musical composer while still a child. In  state media also claimed that his father, Kim Jong-il bowled a perfect  game at a bowling alley, and also shot a world-record score of  across  holes on a golf course in the country. This round included eleven holes-in-one and not one hole with a score of more than a birdie.

A new report casts a fresh spotlight on the captain at the controls of the Malaysian Airlines plane, suggesting he hijacked the jet and deliberately crashed into the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft disintegrated into confetti, in a murder-suicide plot.The claim matches with the findings of independent investigators who have pored over data and other evidence gathered since MH vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March , . They concluded that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah turned around and flew out over the sea until the Boeing  ran out of fuel and violently slammed into the water - but that hasnapost stopped conspiracy theorists.  MH was carrying  passengers, including five children, and  crew members when it disappeared just  minutes after take-off. Wreckage has washed up on beaches on the French island of Reunion and Madagascar, but the most expensive underwater search in aviation history turned up nothing and has been called off for now. Everyone on board is presumed dead and it is feared the bulk of the wreckage - including the flight data recorders - will never be found. What happened to the doomed jet  Was it a murder-suicide  Here are some of the conspiracy theories - many of them ludicrous - that wonapost go away. aposHijackedapos MH aposshot downapos    Private investigator Noel OaposGara believes the plane was shot out of the sky by accident - on the orders of the Malaysian government - after it was hijacked by terrorists. Noel, from Ireland, believes the plane is still lying at the bottom of the ocean but has not ruled out it being secretly removed by the Malaysian government. The investigator says he has spoken to several eyewitnesses who saw the plane crash out of the sky. Oil worker Mike McKay, from New Zealand, claims MH was travelling eastbound when it appeared ason fire when it was hit by the sunlight from the east and then it fell away as it descended again.  Late Dalelah told Noel she thinks she saw the plane as she was flying home from a Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. She told the investigator she saw the plane in the sea. A burning plane was also seen by Katherine Tee who was heading to Phuket in Thailand. And Malaysian fisherman are also said to have told Noel they saw the wreckage of a burning plane hit the sea off Kota Bharu. Noel now believes MH was shot down by fighter pilots, convinced it had been hijacked by terrorists. Plane is aposvisible underwaterapos  There have been a number of claims that MH can be seen intact and underwater in satellite images. One conspiracy theorist claims to have found it off the coast of Padang, Indonesia, about an hour from the Kuala Lumpur airport where it took off.The unnamed author, writing on the website worldpronews, said the plane in the image above could be MH.However, he could not rule out the possibility of it simply being a plane flying above the water. An Australian man has claimed to have found MH still intact and in shallow water in a Google Earth search. He is crowdfunding an expedition and has refused to reveal the location. MH aposcrashed in Cambodian jungleapos  Independent aviation expert Daniel Boyer claims the plane came down in the middle of the Cambodian jungle.Daniel came to his conclusion using Google Maps and insists the blue marks on the images are MHaposs jet outer fuselage.He was so confident that he had found the exact crash site, he sent an expedition to where he believes the plane is about  miles west of Cambodiaaposs capital of Phnom Penh. Daniel claims the team was unable to reach the crash sit because team members were at risk of dehydration or even death. He claims the team chatted to locals who saw the jet and its dragon-like emblem falling from the sky. aposPlane landed and passengers still aliveapos One of the most ridiculous claims is that the plane landed at a secret air base and the passengers and crew are still alive. This one wonapost go away, even though a few pieces of wreckage have been found. Another theory that surfaced online claimed Captain Shah was found alive in a hospital in Taiwan but was suffering from amnesia. Malaysia was forced to rubbish the report as it gained traction on the internet. Pitbull apospredicted disappearanceapos  One of the most ridiculous theories is rapper Pitbull predicted the disappearance. Some YouTube viewers claimed or joked that his  song aposGet it Startedapos foresaw the mystery. The lyrics state: Now itaposs off to Malaysia. Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day. Theorists claim the two passports line refers to the stolen Austrian and Italian passports two Iranian passengers used to board the plane, and the three cities refer to the capitals of Malaysia, China and Vietnam. The two countries, according to the theory, are Malaysia and Vietnam. Foreign government aposshot it downapos There have been countless theories suggesting a foreign government shot down the plane and then covered it up. Why  The explanations have ied. Some have suggested the plane was hijacked and it was taken out to avoid it being used as a weapon of terrorism. Others claim the plane was shot down accidentally during an air force training exercise, or because it was carrying cargo that posed a threat. Another theory claimed the plane was hijacked and the passengersapos organs were harvested. Alien abduction Social media conspiracy theorists were soon claiming the plane and all on board were the victims of an alien abduction. MH was aposcyber hijackedapos  Historian Norman Davies believes tech developed in the aftermath of the   attacks could have been used to hijack the plane.  Developed to prevent another atrocity, he claims the technology could have been used to cyber hijack the plane. Norman told The Sunday Times that MH could have been carrying sensitive Chinese information. He added: There are reports that the cargo detailed in the manest didn’t add up. I don’t know what it might have been carrying but it may have been carrying something somebody didn’t want to get to China.” Experts have disputed the theory. Murdered diplomat The Honorary Malaysian Consul in Madagascar Zahid Raza, who had spent years investigating what happened to MH, was shot dead in Madagascar in . People working with him on the investigation claimed he had received death threats and seemed to have been deliberately targeted. aposExplosion in cargo holdapos One of the theories from early on in the mystery is that there was some kind of explosion or fire in the cargo hold. The official report stated that there was a huge haul of lithium batteries being carried below deck on the doomed flight.  It had long been speculated the consignment of lithium batteries below deck could have been responsible for a fatal fire on board. Investigators eventually concluded it was highly improbable the batteries brought down the plane. aposAnother Bermuda Triangleapos Conspiracy theorists have suggested the plane vanished in a aposBermuda Triangleapos on the other side of the world. There are theories about time warps and black holes as well. aposMurder-suicideapos  Independent investigators concluded that Captain Shah, , hijacked the plane, turned around and set it on a course over the far reaches of the Indian Ocean. The plane then ran out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean as part of a carefully planned murder-suicide plot, according to the investigators. It is claimed Shah - described as often lonely and bored - deliberately depressurised the cabin to kill everyone on board hours before the crash, and switched off the electrical system so the plane couldnapost be tracked. Malaysian investigators have denied the claims that it was a murder-suicide plot by the captain or his inexperienced co-pilot.A friend and fellow pilot  told the Atlantic that Shah likely locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the passenger jet into the sea. Shah had flown a similar path on his flight simulator at home, and aviation experts suspect he was clinically depressed. His we had moved out, he was having an affair with a mum-of-three, he was obsessed with young internet models and he would pace around on his days off waiting for his next flight, it is said. The friend said Shah had been sleeping with flight attendants and was in a bad emotional state. aposExtra passengerapos Could a mystery passenger have taken control of MH and downed it into the sea  Theorists claim an extra passenger with outside help could have taken full command and control of the cockpit. What does the official report say  The official report by Malaysiaaposs government has been called a cover-up by independent aviation experts and investigators. The report published last year states that investigators do not know what happened to the plane, but “unlawful interference by a third party” cannot be ruled out. It dismissed the theory that the plane was brought down by the captain in a murder-suicide mission, and ruled out mechanical failure as a cause. Families of those on board have expressed anger of the lack of answers.

I think he got in the Championship Team of the Year when they won the league in  so he’s a top player.“He was good defensively for us and got up and down all day long.“That’s what you’re looking for from a full-back nowadays.”Losing Smith and McDaid, along with last season’s Championship top scorer Lawrence Shankland, goalkeeper Ross Doohan and defender Michael Rose was a blow for the Honest Men.However, Paisley-born Docherty insists with most of their squad from last season signed up, they can make a push for promotion once again.Experienced heads like former Terror Mark Kerr, Steven Bell, Michael Moffat, Andy Geggan, ex-Dundee man Jamie Adams and Craig Moore have agreed new deals since the end of the last campaign and Docherty has warned they should not be counted out of competing at the top of the table again.He added: “The team did so well and maybe over-achieving has cost us a little.“With that you are going to lose a couple of players.“The big-hitters are away but we have a lot of players signed up who know the club and what it’s all about.”A four-season veteran at Somerset Park, Docherty has made  appearances for Ayr.However, in recent times, he has been dogged by injury and has only had  run outs in each of the past two seasons.He believes he has put those fitness woes behind him and aims to get himself back in the engine-room of a successful team.Docherty added: “Last season I was coming back from injury and once the season started it was hard to get in.“We were doing so well and I was happy to play a role but it was a bit frustrating.“Hopefully, I can be a lot more involved in a good season this time out.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43593756-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43593756-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43593756-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43593756-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"declan mcdaid buzzing to become dundee manager james mcpakes first signing","story":"Declan McDaid is “buzzing” to become Dundee manager James McPake’s first signing as manager.The -year-old signed up at Dens Park on a two-year deal on Thursday after leaving Ayr United at the end of last season.And he plans to entertain fans of the Dark Blues.He said: “I’m a winger, I like to get at people, get balls in the box and get shots off.“Get goals and assists and help the team as much as I can.”The former Partick Thistle man revealed he turned down an Irish club to sign on the dotted line at Dundee.He said: “I got back from holiday and heard that Dundee were interested from my agent.

You are all in with it.“Obviously it is important that you get that time and balance to rest with your family and try to switch off. However, I don’t switch off because the close season is normally busy between myself and my recruitment team.“Even though we are not playing games the summer can sometimes be our busiest period.”The Dons will spend a week at the Fota Island training resort in the south of Ireland where they will face Connah’s Quay Nomads of Wales in a friendly on Saturday June .It is the beginning of the preparation for the European campaign where the Dons will be seeded for the first and, should they progress, second round draws.They were set to find out their first round opponents today.

The player was frustrated when Sunderland boss Jack Ross left him out of his -man squad that lost the League One play-off final to Charlton Athletic.But Sunderland recently triggered a one-year extension clause in McGeouch’s contract until . However, that does not necessarily close the door for a Dons move.Aberdeen are also keen on Livingston midfielder Scott Pittman, but would have to pay a transfer fee to land him.Livingston wanted a six-figure fee when the Dons enquired about Pittman during the January transfer window.Since then Pittman has signed a one-year extension to his deal until summer , which would further increase any transfer fee needed to secure him.McInnes said: “We will try to bring in those new additions that will make us as competitive as we have always been over the last six years. We don’t have the money to throw at it, but we can recruit smartly.”Aberdeen had not given up hope of convincing Scotland international winger Gary Mackay-Steven to remain at Pittodrie, but he could now be set to join Portsmouth.Mackay-Steven’s Dons deal expires on June  and it is understood New York City, who made an approach for the winger in January, have cooled their interest. However, the Dons’ hopes he would sign a new deal appear to have been dashed, as it is understood he will pen a deal with Kenny Jackett’s Pompey this week.Meanwhile, Aberdeen will also welcome back striker Bruce Anderson from a loan spell at Dunfermline.The -year-old scored the Dons’ first goal of the domestic season when netting late on in the - draw with Rangers.Scott Wright will alsofrom a loan period at Dundee.McInnes is also buoyed by the experience Connor McLennan and Dean Campbell gained last season.

Aberdeenshire and Kincardine John Waddell have written to the Scottish Government expressing concerns over traffic queuing along sections of the bypass as well as signs along the route.They state that motorists had been complaining about “poor signage” leading to confusion for people travelling on the dual carriageway.In May, commuters contacted Transport Scotland about speeding and tailbacks at the A A junction, saying it was an “accident waiting to happen”.They also said that the slip road at Kingsford was not big enough to deal with the volume of traffic using the exit during rush hours on weekdays.Transport Scotland previously said it was aware of the traffic problems.The politicians have now called on Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to launch a full review of safety on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route .Mr Waddell said: “The road has been rightly welcomed by most quarters but that does not mean that there are no more improvements left to be made.“Aberdeenshire has some of the most dangerous roads in the country, new roads should be an opportunity to improve on road safety, not make it worse.“We are not seeing enough action to fix the concerns that have been highlighted.“Especially at busy junctions where drivers travelling at high speed could find themselves rushing toward hundreds of vehicles at a standstill.”The letter states that the AWPR has

standards.Mr Rumbles said: “Transport Scotland has a responsibility to maintain safety on the road and there must be more joined-up thinking between the Scottish Government and local councils to alleviate congestion at junctions and major distributor roads.#There is no good to come of the Scottish Government washing their hands of the project now.”A Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: “The safety of road users is of the utmost importance to Transport Scotland.#The AWPR opened to traffic after robust independent road safety audits had been completed satisfactorily and a further road safety audit will be undertaken with any recommendations implemented where appropriate.“We encourage all road users to plan their journeys in advance as it can take some time for drivers to become accustomed to new road layouts.#The signage leading to the AWPR is in line with relevant guidance and has been agreed with stakeholders including the local authorities following an extensive

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing.

There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-hunt-signals-snp-holyrood-majority-in-2021-would-not-be-enough-to-force-second-independence-poll","story":"The Foreign Secretary, who is one of six challengers for the Conservative crown, vowed to ldquohalt the SNP in their tracks, stressed he supported Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, and pledged to work alongside her to oppose a ldquoisive Scottish poll and battle to maintain the United Kingdom.\"Scotland deserves a UK Government that sees the promotion and enhancement of the Union as a driving, daily mission,\" he declared.He echoed the view expressed by Ms Davidson last week, that a government he led would only grant the necessary parliamentary device of a Section  Order to allow another vote on Scotlandrsquos future to take placethe SNP won an \"outright majority in the  Scottish Parliament elections\".But Mr Hunt went further and set two more conditions, including one whereby the SNP would have to provide a ldquoclear timeline for its proposal that Scotland abandon the pound.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Jeremy Hunt says he would try to negotiate a new Brexit deal\",\"description\": \"Jeremy Hunt says he would try to negotiate a new Brexit deal\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs RbOpkpG-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RbOpkpG.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": He explained: \"Scotland is too important for the UK economy and the UK too important for Scotlands economy to allow the SNP to break our nation apart without this.

Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"Toy Story 4  First review from Edinburgh International Film Festival","story":"Directed by Josh CooleyVoices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Annie Potts, Christina Hendricks, Keanu Reeves.

Edinburgh has long had a good relationship with Disney-Pixar, often being given first look at new releases. This time, Toy Story was early for the party, with the festival proper not starting till Wednesday. Time, tides, and marketing schedules wait for no official opening.Toy Story  ended with Andy giving his box of toys to Bonnie as he set off for college. Now Bonnie is about to start nursery, a big milestone in her le. On her first day there she invents a new toy for herself out of a plastic spork .

Every Toy Story is about things being left behind, be it toys, or childhood, even parents to some extent as children become more independent.: What is on at the EIFF in Edinburgh this monthEven so, the lack of a truly original story after all these years of waiting is disappointing. But there is plenty to compensate, including a reunion between Bo Peep and Woody. This is a dferent Bo to the one Woody said goodbye to, one more in keeping with these girl power times. Previously given away by her owner, Bo chose to take herself off the shelf and is now living the le of a free toy, able to do as she pleases.Otherwise, the big laughs are slow to arrive but they do make an appearance, and the joke spread spans all the ages, with lots of Easter eggs for the most dedicated fans. The hyper-real animation is as stunning as ever, and still far ahead of everything  out there.Whenever a new Toy Story arrives there is always a moment when you think, with sadness, that it is not as good as it used to be. Then comes the realisation that a first Toy Story, like childhood Christmases or long hot summers, is something unique and cannot be repeated. The concept has not moved on, but you have.

There are plans to undertake another capital raise, also this year.:Scots firm in link-up to energy councilThe technology, first tested in Glasgow, centres on the Faraday Exchanger, a new type of router replacement that can temper the flow of power at an inidual point or be used alongside others to enhance a wider grid.This model makes the equipment affordable and the idea achievable, he says.\"In essence, the energy system is changing, so we know that we changed the way were generating energy moving away from these large fossil fuel plants and hub-and-spoke model to distribute iable energy as well.\"So, we are changing the way we use energy, weve got more electric vehicles, a lot more digital consumption.\"\"But\", Mr Williams, above, said, \"the grid that connects all of these things together, all of these endpoints, hasnt fundamentally changed in over  years.\"The basis is still poles, wires, transformers and as the systems get more complex what were doingis were adding more and more technology into the system to try and counteract the issues that were experiencing as it grows.\"So, we see our technology as a  to enable us to have this future that we want where we can have more renewable energy, we can have electric vehicles and were able to deliver all of these things whilst maintaining the reliability of the grid.\"We want it to be green, be clean, thats really important for the environment and its really important that energy stays cheap as well.\"The challenge that in one sense were facing, I think it was coined by the World Energy Council, the energy trilemma, which is how do you have affordable, reliable and decarbonised energy systems.\"Faraday Grid is an important part of that.\"Our technology provides a new base layer for the energy system, so we still need the same poles and wires, weve got such a large system that we cant redo it from scratch.\":Edinburgh energy firm sets up in Czech RepublicHe says:\"But we make it more flexible, more robust, so we can do all of these things in the future.\"So we can have more renewables, we can have all these dferent technologies come on, which, at the moment, theyre unable to deliver as much value as they could because the electricity grid itself is an old, passive, rigid system.\"Faraday Grid turns their old system into something a lot smarter and more flexible.\"He compares the upgrade of the world electrical energy system to evolution of telephony.\"It can bring affordable electricity to areas that might have struggled to maintain infrastructure and balance energy production and provision.\"I always think of it like we have the old telephone system, which was copper wires and telephone switches and we were able to replace those switches with routers, and all of a sudden those same copper wires became the internet.\"He said: \"It is similar. We have this old electricity grid and were able to replace existing devices within the electricity grid, in this case transformers, with Faraday Exchangers, which are like the router for the internet of electricity.\"We can literally take out one single transformer which needs to be replaced anyway.\"They are reaching end of le and we can put in one Faraday Exchanger, which can do everything a transformer does, but it does so much more.\"Its able to control the voltage, remove all the noise from the signal.\"We can control the power factor to balance across all these phases and we do it all within a single device.\"All of a sudden youre not having to add all this extra complexity into the network and you get this really nice  that enables double the amount of renewable energy onto the system.\"It reduces losses, it makes everything more flexible, more resilient and I see it is an enabling technology.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentMr Williams said: \"We come in and our technology helps deal with the physics and economics in the short-term volatility of renewables.\"But it also provides a  for other technologies whether it be storage, batteries or fly-wheels, or whatever we end up using, all these things can work in collaboration with Faraday Grid to solve the bigger picture to really enable this energy future that we all want.\"The company aims to be at full commercial status within two years.\"It was one of the key designs considerations when we started working on this many years ago, is that we needed a system that was going to give us this future but it had to be achievable as well.\"We had to have a pathway that we could afford to actually do and one that was going to technically allow us to get to the right endpoint.\"So, thats why one of the major things was how do we do this transition, and thats why a Faraday Exchanger is designed to be a drop-in replacer where a transformer would traditionally be located because we know that theres already a capital replacement schedule in place for those out there.\": Energy firm boosted by US investmentHe said: \"You dont need to replace everything all at once and suddenly switch over to this new system.\"A Faraday Exchanger can literally be dropped into the existing network and it immediately adds value in its local area.\"It resolves the problems of noise in the system and voltage control and these things.\"But then as you start putting multiple exchangers within a grid, they start collaborating and coordinating to form a Faraday Grid and the value that Faraday Grid delivers as a system, rather than those inidual devices, is much better than any inidual device can give by itself.\"One of the key constraints is what we can afford to do. It needs to be achievable, so again its designed in such a way that with existing capital replacement budgets that utilities already have, you can roll out Faraday Grid.\"Instead of buying transformers and all this other equipment, theyre able to just buy Faraday Exchangers instead.\"But because with Faraday Grid the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts, what we actually do with utilities is work very close with them and we simulate the entirety of their network,\"We look at their whole network, we can look at how powers generated and used at the moment, what they expect to happen in the future and not only can we then in the virtual world determine what that grid should look like in , ,  years time with them, wecan actually also then start to look at the economics of it and say well,you stay within your existing capital budget, this would be when you would target putting in the first devices because theyre going to have the biggest benefit.\"Butyou wanted to expedite roll-out to get things faster, it would deliver these additional benefits. You then wouldnt be so dependent on the balancing services.\"A Faraday Grid is able to provide that balancing service from the grid itself, rather than having to procure it from external parties.\"So whilst were making the grid more flexible and having more renewables, were also reducing the cost of energy to the consumer.\"Were still pre-commercial with the technology at the moment.\"Weve manufactured devices, weve had external testing through our power networks demonstration centre in Glasgow.\"Were on the pathway to our next stage as a business is doing what I would call proof of concept projects with utilities.\"Weve targeted utilities as our first pathway into the market because the network effect of operating within the grid allows us to have a real multiplier effect and its where we can add the most value.\"So we will work with a number of utilities globally to do these projects over the next year or two and on the back of that we will be a full commercial business.\"Its tremendously exciting. Scotland has been a great place for us as a business. Theres great talent both in Scotland and Scotlands obviously being very open as a country has enabled us to attract talent from across Europe as well.\"Its at the forefront of all renewables and pushing the boundaries and quite innovative. So its been a fantastic place for a business like us. But then very similar to Australia.ldquoIts going to be quite collaborative because, as an engineer I would say physics is everywhere.\"Our technology is ubiquitous, we want to be able to deliver the value that we have to the world.\"Scotland and the UK is very important, but we also want to be able to add value in Europe and North America and Australia and Japan and these key markets. In order to do that we need to grow very quickly as a business.\"So we have established innovation centres, its set in Scotland and then in Washington DC and now in Czech Republic as well and thats just to enable us to have the right skills and resources to be able to deliver globally.\"We have plans to open additional centres as well. Weve grown over the last couple of years from just the founders to reach a couple of hundred people globally now.\"Were calculating by the end of the year having a thousand people, and then growing from there.\"From a business perspective the next steps are also the projects to demonstrate the technology in real-world grids.\"We want to do this across dferent geographies in dferent types of regulatory markets with dferent technical use cases.\"One might be a really congested area, a major city, one might be where theres a lot of rooftop solar or a long radial line that has voltage control issues.\"We really want to demonstrate that the value that our technology can add over such a wide range of cases because ultimately we believe that access to reliable, affordable and clean energy is really one of the most critical issues facing society in a sense.\"We cant focus just on having clean and reliable without having affordable energy as well, and Faraday Grid as a  is about enabling all three of those at the same time.Setting in Edinburgh three years ago allowed the founders \"to take advantage of Scotlandrsquos world-class engineering heritage, have access to leading academic institutions and utilise the talent pool across the country\".However, the seed of the Faraday Grid idea started many years before this, and the founders say they have been working on solving the worldrsquos biggest challenges throughout their careers.The team says that in seeing issues with the Australian electricity grid ndash with claims of blackouts and regular energy price increases, which in some states were said to have doubled over the last  years ndash it became their vocation to ldquoresolve the worldrsquos fragile energy system.He added: \"Michael Faraday was one of the most influential scientists in history and his inventions and discoveries have laid the foundation for the work we are doing, designing an energy infrastructure fit for the future.ldquoAt Faraday Grid, with our mission to provide secure, sustainable and affordable energy for everyone, we stand on the shoulders of giants.QAWhat countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why I enjoy the culture, history and architecture in European cities.

There are  cashpoints in Scotland, with  ATMs gone over  months.LossiemouthScotland has also lost one in three bank branches in just eight years, with over  closing since , making it one of the worst affected areas in the UK, and more often than not, the cashpoints will also go with them.:One in five cash machines in Scotland to charge in a yearLast month the ATM Industry Association, the non-profit trade group, whose members include banks such as HSBC, independent ATM operators and payment systems such as Visa, warned that nearly one in five of Scotlands existing free to access cash machines are expected to introduce charges to customers in the next  months.They say the problem revolves around a % or p cut in the fee that the bank pays cash machine operators every time money is withdrawn.The regulator is carrying out a longer-term review looking into the factors that affect the distribution of ATMs across the country and what be done in future to make sure people have the access to cash they need or want.It will examine consumersrsquo and societyrsquos cash needs, and the incentives to keep cash machines, including the controversial fees structure.It is planning to set out a view on the way forward for interchange fees before the end of .The PSR says thatthere is evidence that shows the payment systems industry is failing to deliver greater competition, more innovation and greater benefits for businesses or consumers, then the can bring in a series of measures to demand action is taken.Those could also involve amending agreements on fees and charges and to take action where they see anti-competitive behaviour.A PSR spokesman said: \"In October , we gave LINK [which oversees the UKs largest cash machine network] a direction to make sure it does all it can to meet its commitments to protecting the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs.:Scots pay price as one in seven cant use bank cards due to IT failures\"We are aware that some ATMs have changed from free-to-useATMs to pay-to-use .

Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary in what passes for the British Government these days, says responsibility ldquoalmost certainly lies with Iran, and talks of a ldquogreat risk of war. Iran denied involvement, and then yesterday ramped up tensions by announcing it will breach the limit on stockpiling enriched uranium which can be used to make nuclear bombs.The backdrop is Donald Trumprsquos abandonment of the Iranian nuclear deal last year ndash a trade-off between Iranrsquos nuclear ambitions and the lting of sanctions. Mr Trump reimposed sanctions. Iran is now asking Europe to step in. Fears of war grow.Talk of conflict in the era of Brexit and Trump is enough to send most folk running for their Protect and Survive pamphlet. Itrsquos like waking up from a bad dream to find yoursquore in a Technicolor nightmare.Letrsquos be clear, the British and American governments are lost beneath such a snowdrt of lies that eventhe ghost of Ayatollah Khomeini rose from the dead and gave a press conference admitting Tehranrsquos culpability in the gulf attack, it would still be hard to believe London and Washington. Britain and America make the boy who cried wolf seem a reliable eye-witness.First, wersquove the legacy of the Iraq War to contend with ndash a war based on lies. American and British spies were pressurised by the Bush and Blair administrations to cook up a phoney case for war based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction .The only WMDs were weapons of mass deception, as the British and American media amplied the lies of the two administrations and failed to hold their deceits to account. Remember headlines like ldquo minutes from doom as the tabloids told us Saddam could attack UK interests  Or journalists rah-rahing for war like Kitchener reborn  Remember Parliament caving in Iraq fatally damaged British and American democracy. Lies which led to illegal wars, civilian deaths, and mass terrorism arenrsquot easily forgotten. Iraq drained all trust in politics. Itrsquos no surprise that America and Britain rejected the establishment and looked toward populism in the shape of Donald Trump and Brexit.Against the tide of blood from Iraq, wersquore now being asked to believe what London and Washington say over the gulf attacks. Only a fool believes a liar. London and Washington have to prove their claims beyond a shadow of doubt. Their word means nothing anymore.Germanyrsquos foreign minister isnrsquot alone when he casts doubt on the claims. Even a video purporting to show Iranian troops removing an unexploded mine from one tanker didnrsquot convince Heiko Mass. ldquoThe video is not enough, he said. ldquoTo make a final assessment, this is not enough for me. France is silent. The EU is assessing evidence.Therersquos also a discrepancy in evidence. After claims that the tankers were mined, the crew of one ship said they were hit by ldquoflying objects. Therersquos no room for mistakes when it comes to war with a regime like Iran.Read more: Hunt warns of great risk of drt to warThe memories of Iraq War lies arenrsquot the only untruths we need to deal with ndash wersquore now being asked to believe President Trump, a man who lies as much as he toilet-tweets. Lying for Trump is an involuntary reflex he lies like rest of us breathe. By April this year, he had told an astonishing , lies while in the Oval Office.Britain is likely to have a liar installed as Prime Minister shortly, in a bloodless coup staged by rich English pensioners who control the Tory Party. It feels like the last act of a death cult: the Rev Jim Jones comes to the Cotswolds.

Lies are in his mitochondrial DNA, not just his bones. Hersquos also Trumprsquos ideological gimp, shuffling along behind each populist move like a well-trained pet slave.Trump makes hay with anti-Muslim rhetoric and Johnson is in with his Enoch Powell one-liners about Muslim women in burkas being ldquoletterboxes.The decision over whether or not Britain and America go to war with Iran could be taken by these two men soon. Trump and Johnson ndash a cheeseburger in a power suit, and a man who looks like a drop-kicked blancmange, neither of whom has a shred of moral fibre or decency. They share mendacity and a lack of scruples like they share bedhead.A lot of centrists today play a game where they cast their memories back to the days of Bush and Blair and think wistfully of the past. ldquoIt was bad, but it wasnrsquot this bad, goes the thinking. The past, in their minds, becomes a safe space from Trump and Brexit.Theyrsquore fooling themselves. Bush and Blair were criminal liars responsible for mass deaths. If war begins with Iran, wersquoll just have a new C-list cast ndash Trump and Johnson starring in the worst remake in history.America is a rogue nation, and Britain is a basket case. War and peace should not be for either to decide. The United Nations infamously tried to rein in Bush and Blair over Iraq and failed miserably. Today, all issues of world peace need to be under the aegis of the UN ndash and the European Union has to make this fact abundantly clear on the global stage. If London and Washington think they can prove Tehran was behind the attacks, they need to be told to bring conclusive evidence before the world.I donrsquot know the truth of the Gulf attacks. No-one does, yet. But It looks bad for Iran. However, looks can be deceiving, as we discovered when Saddam was captured hiding in a spider-hole with not a WMD in sight. The United Nations has to be the final court of arbitration, and Europe must fight to make that happen.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"council to make final call on parking fees","story":"Councillors are poised to formally rubber-stamp plans which will see the scrapping of free parking at every Aberdeenshire pay and display car-park.Following both statutory and public consultations in the Spring, the findings are being brought before Thursday’s meeting of the council’s Infrastructure Service Committee .However, despite objections being received, officers do not believe they present any fundamental reason for changes to the council’s original decision made back in January.They are recommending that the council proceeds with the introduction of agreed new tarfs which would see the first hour’s parking costing p, followed by £ for one to two hours, £ for two to five hours and £ for over five hours.Despite massive public and business opposition to the proposals, the council maintains that it is facing a projected £, car-park budget deficit for the current financial year.Prior to the introduction of the free tarfs in  there had been around , transactions annually in its car parks, but while that has risen to . million in  , some  percent were free.Earlier this year head of transportation Ewan Wallace said that running the off-street car parks was now being done at a deficit and was putting “pressure on other council departments”.He said officers had examined ious scenarios and were convinced that the dropping of free parking and the introduction of smaller charges would be the most effective way to reduce the funding gap.However, representations from both the statutory and public consultations insist it will hit businesses and rural customers during an already dficult economic climate.In its response, business improvement group Rediscover Peterhead writes: “The removal of a free parking period would be an additional hurdle to visiting the town centre and will likely drive away customers and visitors effectively reversing the pattern that the free periods initiated in .“The overwhelming majority of town centre businesses polled are against the proposed change to the free parking period. Rediscover Peterhead, as an organisation representing these businesses and their wider economic future, are against the removal of the free parking period.“Further we consider collaborative working with all organisations to be a fundamental part of a Business Improvement District and its success and in this instance the view contained here we expect to be very much considered in the decision-making process, rather than a simple box-ticking consultation exercise.”The Federation of Small Businesses has also waded into the debate, warning Aberdeenshire Council to study and review the impact that parking charges have had in the neighbouring Angus Council area.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The event will be held at the Garioch Heritage Centre\"  Dementia Strategy to be developedviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Bread Guys Bakerys award winning Brioche Buns\"  Award success for Inverurie bakery viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It states: “Since November , there have been reports of businesses across dferent sectors in Angus forced to close their doors, with many citing a drastic fall in footfall and takings.

Fty ships went to the seabed.In later years, many were later brought to the surface again during one of the most remarkable salvage operations ever attempted.Those that remain – seven vessels in all # attract ers from worldwide and make Scapa Flow the premier wreck ing site in Europe.The programme begins on Saturday, June , and involves talks by experts, performances by the German Navy and Royal Navy musicians, underwater imagery, a theatre piece, the screening of a  documentary on the scuttling – and the chance to explore the seabed wrecks using the latest virtual reality technology.Descendant of those involved in the events are set to come to Orkney, and a special service of commemoration will take place over one of the wrecks and at the Lyness Naval Cemetery.Full details are available on the Orkney Islands Council website: www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S scapa--events-programme.htm and on the Scapa  Facebook page www.facebook scapa copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyCouncil defends warning householder they could face hefty fine over unauthorised Irish language street sign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"Police in Craigavon are advising motorists that a road in the Gilford area is currently closed due to a fallen tree.Traffic and Travel,  ..Woman injured in crash outside election count centre in Co DownA woman has been injured after a car ended up on its roof outside an election count in Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..Drivers warned of lsquorisk of icy conditionsrsquoThe Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.Traffic and Travel,  ..A road traffic collision is now clearedA road traffic collision on the A has now been cleared.Traffic and Travel,  ..These are the best airlines in Europe, according to TripAdvisorChoosing an airline to travel abroad is typically swayed by price, but paying less money doesnt always guarantee the best service.Things To Do,  ..Two vehicle collision on busy N.I. road causing long delaysA two vehicle road traffic collision on a busy Northern Ireland road on Tuesday is causing major delays.Traffic and Travel,  ..Man dies following crash on A dual carriagewayA man has died following a two vehicle road traffic collision on the A dual carriageway in Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..\" title\"The air ambulance. \" \" Two people taken to hospital after serious collisionTwo people have been taken to hospital following a two-vehicle road traffic collision near Dromore, Co Down.Traffic and Travel,  ..Four vehicle smash on MA four vehicle road traffic collision has caused major disruption to morning rush hour traffic on the M.Traffic and Travel,  ..Diesel spill causing serious traffic disruptionPolice are reporting long tailbacks on the A near Dromore, Co Down following a road traffic collision in the area earlier this evening.Traffic and Travel,  ..Temperatures set to plummet tonightMotorists across Northern Ireland are being advised of potential icy road conditions tonight.Traffic and Travel,  ..Sheep causing havoc on AMotorists are being asked to take care after reports of sheep running loose on the A.Traffic and Travel,  ..M crash causing long delaysA road traffic collision on the M is causing long traffic delays.Traffic and Travel,  ..Entire section of M now closedThe PSNI has closed both lanes in a section of the M.Traffic and Travel,  ..Young man killed in motorcycle crashPolice investigating a road traffic collision which claimed the le of a young motorcyclist have appealed for witnesses to come forward.Traffic and Travel,  ..Road traffic collision causing traffic disruptionA road traffic collision in Banbridge is causing traffic disruption.Traffic and Travel,  ..Man killed in two vehicle collision has been namedThe man who died following a road traffic collision on the A between Banbridge and Dromore last night has been named.Traffic and Travel,  ..Travel news: Fallen tree partially blocking Co Down roadMotorists have been advised to expect delays on the A Moyallan Road between Moyallan and Gilford.Traffic and Travel,  ..Train users warned to expect disruption to servicesTranslink is advising train passengers that works will take place on the railway line between Portadown and Lisburn this weekendand next weekend .Traffic and Travel,  ..

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

They say that eating and sleeping are two of le’s greatest pleasures and at the Grand Central the hotel excels.Because it was a special occasion we were booked into the hotel’s exquisite Seahorse restaurant and as a storm whipped up on Bedford Street – yes this is June – we were greeted by manager Rachel Brown, a fantastic asset to the hotel and promptly welcomed with a slate of moreish, freshly baked Guinness and treacle bread. The bread was devoured before a delicate Amuse Bouche of raw roasted caullower in butter, caullower purée, blitzed beetroot and crispy kale seared in butter followed.Appetisers on the menu, devised by Executive Chef Damian Tumilty, included ham hock and foie gras terrine, local crab dressed in a yogurt and mirin sauce but it was the ‘stars’ of the sea, local scallops served with a Jersusalem artichoke velouté and black olives, times two, that won out. Mains of roast monkfish tail with herb crusted potatoes, beetroot and asparagus along with crispy pork belly with a sizable wedge of potato gratin, caullower and cider soaked raisins were ordered and were hands down two of the most memorable meals we have ever had the pleasure of eating. The chunky monkish tail was cooked perfectly with the beetroot and asparagus proving the right light companions to the dish. An empty plate across the table seconded my opinion that this was a stand out dining experience. Having next to no room I waved the white flag, napkin and declined dessert. My husband opted for a slated caramel, popcorn covered chocolate slice that complimented all that came before.Much has already been written about the Grand Central’s Observatory Bar, sat atop its rd floor being a must see – and every word of it is true. The bar is accessed via its own lt and operator and once brought in the views are nothing short of spectacular, encompassing the city and all its quarters. Over a pint and G#T we watched the sun disappear over a grey blanket of rain clouds and revert back again, such is having our own weather system.After the best night sleep in ages thanks to the hotel’s King Coil beds, we were back in the Seahorse for breakfast. All self service, there was no chance of going hungry as huge bowls of fresh fruit, coulis, muesli, granola and yogurt along with Irwin’s bread selection were all at your disposal. A hot breakfast is also on offer and my request of poached eggs was no trouble at the kitchen pass. Pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea set us up for the day and sadly it was time for check out.It was not an inconvenience for us or guests upon leaving to leave our bags at reception to collect at a later stage in the day, a great service when you still want to have a look round the shops and not have to ‘lug’ your luggage with you.The Grand Central celebrates its first birthday this month but already feels like it was always part of the Bedford Streetscape as it has set about making its mark. Tourists and those wanting something memorable to celebrate, can do so, in classic style, at the Grand Central.For more information visit www.grandcentralhotelbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reps and union leaders meet over upskirting","story":"NORTH Belfast political representatives have joined union officials in meeting two teachers who were the victims of ‘upskirting’ to discuss the need for legislation around the issue.The meeting, which took place at Stormont on Monday, comes after the conviction of, Timothy Boomer , who was recently convicted of five counts of outraging public decency in relation to videos he took as a pupil at a Co Fermanagh school in  and .In itself, the act of ‘upskirting’ is not a crime in the North of Ireland, and campaigners have long called for legislation on the issue, which was discussed at Monday’s meeting.Speaking to the North Belfast News, NASUWT official, Justin McCamphill, said:“We held the meeting to give the victims in that case to set out their experiences and to discuss why the current legislation is inadequate.“The women actually had to take a judicial review against the PPS before the case was prosecuted. It was prosecuted under counts of outraging public decency.“The problem with that law is that it doesn’t treat them as the victims – it treats the general public as the victims. The conviction only happened because it was proven to be a public place because there was more than two people present. If there were no other people there it wouldn’t be illegal at all.“We were there to argue for specic laws. There are similar laws in Scotland, England and Wales, but we want our own bespoke laws.”He added: “In the event that the assembly is up and running we will be going to the justice committee and asking them to make a recommendation to the Department of Justice to bring in legislation to address this.”Following the meeting, North Belfast People Before Profit Councillor, Fiona Ferguson stressed the importance of better legislation and culture change to deal with this kind of sexual crime.“These women were let down by their employer, the police and the legal system. At points they were essentially told ‘boys will be boys’ and even when a prosecution was made, it was under common law of ‘outraging public decency’, which means that in the eyes of the law, the public witnesses were the victims, not the teachers who were upskirted. “We need comprehensive legislation that deals with cases where images are taken deliberately and without consent, so that victims can have a reasonable expectation of justice. And we need a societal sht in how we view consent. It is not good enough that in  women feel unsafe in their workplaces. It is not good enough that cases of upskirting are being dealt with in ways that reinforce the ‘boys will be boys’ culture that justies sexual crime.“The DoJ proposes to adopt the voyeurism legislation in Britain but it would not have led to a prosecution in the case of these teachers, and that is shows that it is not comprehensive enough.’“These women are incredibly brave for speaking out for other women and girls, and NASUWT should be commended for supporting them and leading th"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"may too pliant in agreeing breixt backstop claims brady","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year. Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council. Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services. “I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council. “There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments. Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff.  A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  . However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m. Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"kriegel trial jury sent home after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Association of Catholic Priests in Ireland said: \"The reality is that whatever is decided, and something has to be decided, will percolate into the wider Church.\"Fr Brendan Hoban, a Co Mayo-based priest, said what was important \"is not that its done well but that its happening at all\".He said the announcement was made in the context of \"a Eucharistic famine\" which he said was \"just around the corner\" and had been obvious for years. According to Fr Hoban, unless the documents proposal on bringing women into governance is real, as distinct from cosmetic, \"it will only serve to remind women how disrespected and taken for granted they have been for centuries in the Catholic Church\". He warned that unless there is some movement on female deacons, women will just continue to walk away.Co Down columnist and broadcaster Fr Brian DArcy welcomed what he described as \"a basic proposal\" but said he didnt understand why it was applicable just to elder men.\"It will hopefully be accepted and in time broadened to all suitable married candidates,\" he said.Dr Tina Beattie, professor of Catholic studies at Roehampton University in London, cautiously welcomed what she described as a \"pastorally-motivated initiative\" on married men and priesthood. But she noted that it was only proposed for the Amazon. She highlighted that there are already many married Catholic priests in Britain following the decision of some clergymen to leave the Church of England over the issue of women priests and join the ordinariate.Professor Beattie also stressed that there are \"vexing questions of injustice with regard to many celibate Catholic priests who long for marriage and family le but are denied these opportunities\".

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17695305.campaign-keen-to-keep-pressure-on-northern-irelands-politicians/resources/images/9881703.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Statistics show , households have been supported into home ownership using the schemes in just over a decade.A total of % of purchasers who accessed the schemes were aged  or younger in -.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said: ldquoWe want to make sure everyone has a safe, warm, affordable place to call home, and creating a fairer housing market will help us achieve that.ldquoA home is so much more than just a place to live ndash it awards a sense of identity, belonging and pride.He added: ldquoWe know how dficult it can be for many people to save for a deposit and get on to the property ladder, especially without financial support from family and friends.ldquoI am pleased these figures show we are supporting young first-time buyers on to the property ladder, with more than % of households being first-time buyers and more than % aged  and under.ldquoThese current programmes will be joined by a Scottish Government national pilot scheme to provide support for first-time buyers by contributing to the deposit they need when buying their first home. Scottish Liberal Democrat housing spokeswoman Caron Lindsay said the Help to Buy scheme had enabled households on higher incomes to access it.ldquoPeople will be surprised to see households with an income of up to pound, accessing the SNP Governmentrsquos Help to Buy scheme, she said.ldquoHouseholds with this sort of income should be able to afford to buy a home without the Governmentrsquos help.ldquoIf the system is imbalanced then the risk is that Help to Buy drives up prices while having little effect on supply.She added: ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to consider whether this is really the best use of its resources.ldquoWe could do so much more for people on lower incomes.ldquoMinisters also need to reflect on the National Audit Officersquos report last week, which found that the equivalent scheme in England saw big builders raking in profits and the system being used by people who didnrsquot necessarily need it..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Home ownership schemes help thousands on to property ladder article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
