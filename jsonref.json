This derelict building pictured was the family-owned pie store Cooke\u0027s Pie \u0026amp Mash shop in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, established in 1899, after it moved from it\u0027s Goldhawk Road site between 1934 and 2015. In its prime, it was popular with Queens Park Rangers fans on their way to Loftus Road Stadium, and celebrity customers such as Pete Townsend of The Who and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols. The building also features in the 1979 film Quadrophenia         The Lambeth Waterworks Company (pictured) was founded in 1785, and occupied the current site of the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank. It moved to Seething Wells, Surbiton, in 1852 amid concern over the quality of the drinking water taken from the Thames. Clean water from Surbiton played a major role improving waterborne disease cholera. In 1854, Dr John Snow compared families drinking water piped from Seething Wells with those using water from the Thames and concluded people who drank Lambeth Waterworks water did not contract cholera. In 1855 the Metropolis Water Act made it illegal to take Thames water for domestic use         The book will also show how some of the buildings in Mr Talling\u0027s first book have been transformed since 2008.

One such gentrified building is this graffiti-clad building on Pitfield Street, in Hoxton         ‹ Slide me ›    The overgrown gates of Stanwell Place, in Stanwell (pictured now and then), just outside of Heathrow Airport once marked the entrance to a stately country house, first built in the seventeenth century. During the Second World War, the house and estate played a crucial role in the Allies\u0027 military strategy. Sir John Watson Gibson, who lived at Stanwell Place until his death in 1947, helped design the portable Mulberry Harbours used to drop cargo in France after the D-Day landings. In 1944, the property also hosted two crucial allied military meetings attended by senior US commanders including General Dwight D. Eisenhower  He also set up a website others could shared their memories of neglected buildings within and around the M25. \u0027It was an unexpected hit, and in 2008 I compiled some of the most popular destinations in a book - the first edition of Derelict London.\u0027\u0027Since then, London has changed beyond all recognition. Formerly run-down areas have reached the height of cool, whereas once-proud buildings have fallen victim to the wrecking ball. It is time for a book that brings the tale of derelict London up to date,\u0027 he said.The new book will take people on a journey to long-forgotten tube stations, burnt-out mansions, gently decaying football stadiums around London.          Another structure featured is the Surrey Street Pumping Station in Croydon, just yards away from one of London\u0027s oldest street markets. This turreted building was built by Croydon\u0027s authorities who, in 1849, established Britain\u0027s first Board of Health to improve sanitation in the area. Recently, many characterless modern buildings have been built in the vicinity of the pumping station, but it has been neglected         ‹ Slide me ›    The Spotted Dog in Forest Gate (now and then), which dates back to the late fifteenth century, was once a hunting lodge used by King Henry VIII, whose dogs were kennelled here. In the early nineteenth century it was converted into a pub and according to one of Talling\u0027s correspondents, there was once an underground passage that ran between the Dog and the Boleyn Tavern a mile to the south. The entrance to the tunnel is still visible in the basement of the Boleyn, but has been filled in with concrete           The derelict York Road Station was an underground station opened in 1906 on the Piccadilly line in Barnsbury, just a short distance from King\u0027s Cross Station. The station was awkwardly situated in a run-down industrial area and never received many visitors. In 1909 some trains didn\u0027t stop at the station during the week, by 1918 there was no Sunday service and in 1932 it was closed completely         Originally based around the corner in Catherine Wheel Yard, Wilson \u0026amp Kyle moved to these now rundown buildings on Brentford High Street in the 1950s. The company, which once employed 160 people, made prototype tank parts, anti-aircraft gun equipment and assembly jigs for aeroplanes, and during the Second World War specialised in fuel-injection equipment for ships\u0027 diesel engines. Wilson \u0026amp Kyle company closed in 1998 and the factory has remained derelict ever since         This abandoned building in Limehouse was first built in 1869 as a sail-maker and ship chandler warehouse. From 1889 to 1972 it was occupied by Caird \u0026amp Rayner from 1889 to 1972, and retains its original cast-iron window frames and two doubleloading doors. Caird \u0026amp Rayner were engineers and coppersmiths who specialised in the design and manufacture of seawater-distilling plants, which were supplied to Royal Navy vessels and Cunard cruise liners. More recently, it was used as a vehicle repair shop and previous owners planned to demolish the premises to make way for a block of flats, but planning permission was refused.

Thankfully, I kept my cool and the shot came off’I grew up in Adelaide, which hosted the Australian Grand Prix until 1995. I lived close to the track. From my house, I could hear the cars screeching. It was a huge spectacle and it felt as if everyone followed it in some way. I got to watch the racing on a couple of occasions, but as I grew older drifted away from the sport.Today I live in Melbourne, where the race is now held. Being here has helped me to reconnect with the sport. I knew Formula One was coming to town so I asked the McLaren team to let me shoot with them. I explained that I was interested in understanding the team, not just photographing the race. I didn’t want to shoot your typical F1 shot. I was amazed when they agreed.They let me scope out the garage and track in advance, so I had this shot composed and framed well before the race. Everything moves so quickly: without that time to plan, you’re never going to get the shot you need. I knew I would have only a matter of seconds, which is pretty difficult on the medium-format Hasselblad I use. It’s a slow camera that’s more often used for landscape photography than sport, let alone something as quick as F1.Race day is intense. It’s hot and loud and everything can change in an instant. When you get into the garage, you need to have your wits about you. It’s a high-performing team with lots of people in a confined area working under immense pressure. You might be there to get the shot – but they are there to win.I watched the race from atop the pit wall, nervously waiting for the moment. McLaren had two drivers in the race: Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris. My work depended on them making a stop, which itself depended on a bunch of tactical considerations outside my control. A mechanical fault meant that Sainz had to retire early. That left me with one chance: the only stop Norris made in the entire race. It lasted 2.7 seconds. I had one press of the button. Thankfully, I kept my cool and it came off.When most people think about Formula One, they think about the drivers. But in this shot, you have 15 guys who are immensely skilled, profoundly dedicated and critical to the success of whoever’s in the driver’s seat. They work a punishingly long season, and this captures their perfect synchronicity. There’s no space or time for ego. Everyone has to work as a unit. And this is only one aspect of a massive operation. Outside of the race team, there’s everyone who helped build the car, as well as a huge data centre in the UK monitoring race stats in real time and advising on tactics.I hope the shot is a new way of looking at the sport. A few years ago, I became fascinated with hyperrealistic painting – works you couldn’t distinguish from photographs. It got me thinking whether I could work the other way round, turning photography into something flatter, more illustrative, more ambiguous. I set out to challenge myself – physically, mentally and as a photographer. I came away from the Grand Prix a better artist.Studied: “3D animation in Adelaide, but I’m a self-taught photographer.”Influences: “The paintings of Jeffrey Smart and David Hockney.”High point: “Last year, I was named a Hasselblad Master, a dream come true.”Low point: “When I lost inspiration and stopped shooting for a year.”Top tip: “Stick with it through thick and thin. Persistence is everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5085149800ae00ff62d6f5b5ddc1d6c81444fff4/0_54_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=481744d970c8c5029d99de3f816b879d","title":"george osborne ambitions over imf top job prompt criticism","story":"Former UK chancellor’s austerity agenda will count against him, say opponentsGeorge Osborne’s interest in running the International Monetary Fund has met immediate criticism because of the former chancellor’s austerity policies and Brexit-related question marks over the UK’s international standing.The former chancellor has signalled to friends that he views himself as a potential candidate to replace Christine Lagarde, the current head of the Washington-based fund, who was nominated to lead the European Central Bank this week.However, his role as the architect of austerity was highlighted on Thursday as being badly out of step with the needs of the global economy, while the IMF has gradually also begun to distance itself from a fiscal approach that requires heavy cuts to public spending.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the  that the use of austerity had hindered the UK’s recovery from the financial crisis. He said: “Before the decision is made on any IMF appointment, consideration should be made to the fact that George Osborne was the architect of the slowest recovery from a recession since Napoleonic times.“That’s hardly the record or qualification for someone to steer the ship of the global economy.”The IMF, which was a prominent advocate of austerity around the time Osborne was chancellor, has since drifted away from backing budget cuts as a means to balancing the books. Academics at the fund criticised neoliberal economics in an influential report three years ago, while Lagarde has urged greater public spending to promote economic growth.Commenting on Osborne’s potential candidacy, Paul Diggle of the investment group Aberdeen Standard, said Osborne’s record of cutting government spending in a bid to achieve growth no longer dovetailed with the fund’s ethos. He said: “He is a big advocate for expansionary fiscal contraction and that is no longer in vogue at the IMF. His thinking doesn’t really chime with where the fund is at.”Criticising the former chancellor, Paul Krugman, the Nobel-prize winning economist, tweeted: “Hey, why not? If Trump is nominating people who got everything wrong about monetary policy for the Fed, why not someone who insisted that austerity is expansionary for the IMF?”Britain’s status on the world stage on the back of acrimonious talks with Brussels over Brexit could also damage the chances of a Brit securing the support of other nations to run the IMF, which promotes cooperation between countries to drive economic growth.Europeans have run the IMF since the second world war, in an unwritten understanding that allows for an American to lead its twin institution, the World Bank.Stefan Gerlach, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, warned that EU member states could object to the appointment of the first UK citizen to run the IMF while Brexit is taking place.“It is difficult to imagine that in these pre-Brexit days, any UK candidate would enjoy the support of the EU. The temptation to show the benefits EU members have is too strong,” he tweeted.Candidates to run the IMF need to be nominated, either by a member of its 24-strong executive board or by a representative of one of the 189 nations in the IMF sitting on its board of governors – usually a country’s finance minister or central bank governor.Philip Hammond represents the UK on the IMF board, although he is widely expected to be replaced as chancellor when the next prime minister assumes office.Osborne would likely face stiff competition from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, whom the former chancellor appointed to run Threadneedle Street back in 2013.Although Canadian by birth, Carney also holds British and Irish citizenship. He is due to leave the Bank early next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c732ab4d3d39e1f6ee494bdff8570bde1ef7a6c2/0_111_2588_1554/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75eb633244b10c9094a2f97c255edfa5","title":"george osborne imf job christine lagarde stock markets economy business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, including the latest runners and riders to run the International Monetary FundEconomics professor Danny Blanchflower, who served on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, reckons Osborne’s austerity programme derailed the UK’s recovery:Kristalina Georgieva, the Bulgarian chief operating officer of the World Bank, has also been tipped as a potential IMF head, according to the Financial Times.Georgeiva has previously served as a European Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis response, and as a vice-president of the EC, following an academic career in economics. She briefly ran the World Bank earlier this year after Jim Kim quit.Back in January, she told the World Economic Forum in Davos about the importance of battling the climate emergency:When you think about climate, get a photo of your children and grandchildren in front of you. I guarantee you it will change your perspective. I did this and it works.If you want to know what the International Monetary Fund is thinking, it’s good to check out their blogs. Written by economists across the Fund, they cover a wider range of issues than its regular economic outlook reports.In the last two months, this has included articles on tariffs and trade wars, education, two pieces on fintech, two on climate change and three on inequality (plus pieces on the state of the global economy and debt levels).George Osborne doesn’t really have a track record on such issues... unlike Mark Carney. The governor of the Bank of England has been pushing green finance, and trying (with limited success) to make the BoE a more open institution. Just this week, he explained how global trade wars damaged growth and prosperity. He also chairs an important committee of central bankers that looks out for threats to the global economy.Plus, Carney will soon be available, and holds both Irish and British citizenship - meaning he satisfies the rule that the IMF chief should be European. Surely a front-runner to replace Christine Lagarde?There’s also chatter today that Mario Draghi, the outgoing head of the European Central Bank, would make a better IMF chief.That would mean an usual jobswap, as Christine Lagarde is heading from Washington to Frankfurt to succeed Draghi.Bloomberg’s Ferdinando Giugliano reckons Draghi (the man who saved the euro in the debt crisis) has ideal experience managing crises, working with political leaders and fiercely defending European monetary union.Perhaps the sharpest take so far, from the FT’s Katie Martin:Not that the pound’s habit of lurching around like an emerging market currency since the Brexit vote is a laughing matter....Looks like George Osborne has been hard at work at the Evening Standard -- they’re splashing on the Tory leadership race, and the new Chelsea manager (unusually, a top job which Osborne didn’t go for...)No mention of his own hunt for a move to the IMF....Surely George Osborne can rely on The Spectator to back his charge towards the International Monetary Fund?Apparently not! A new article on the conservative current affairs magazine argues that Osborne would be a ideal continuity candidate to fill Christine Lagarde’s shoes - but that’s not what the Fund needs.Matthew Lynn writes on its Coffee House blog:Smooth. Intelligent and articulate. A former finance minister. A European. And perhaps most importantly of all, a mildly irritating potential rival to the prime minister of his own country. In lots of ways, George Osborne ticks all the boxes to replace Christine Lagarde as the managing director of the IMF. Indeed, if you were looking for a perfect replica of the incumbent, minus the pearls and the elegant neck scarfs, you might well settle on the former chancellor.....The UK should press for a British MD. But it can surely find a better candidate than the former chancellor, no matter how much he might want the job.Miriam Brett, who analyses the impact of the IMF and the World Bank’s policies, also has concerns about George Osborne’s suitability:John McDonnell is right - the UK’s recovery from the 2008-09 recession on George Osborne’s watch was remarkably poor.As ever, there are various factors to consider. The eurozone crisis, which flared into life in 2011, undermined the UK’s own recovery. With many European countries falling into recession, there was less demand for British-made goods and services.But the UK’s push into austerity was surely also a major factor, choking off the recovery that was underway at the end of Gordon Brown’s administration. As Britain’s economy stalled, tax revenues disappointed, meaning the Cameron administration never came close to its goal of eliminating the budget deficit -- its flagship economic policy.Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, questions whether George Osborne is the right person to run the International Monetary Fund.Speaking to the , McDonnell says:Before the decision is made on any IMF appointment, consideration should be made to the fact that George Osborne was the architect of the slowest recovery from a recession since Napoleonic times.That’s hardly the record or qualification for someone to steer the ship of the global economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9008715027da3a0c453d9f1ec30993936ff4cd2d/0_178_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef4a4354a365f43fac5c550f479b0740","title":"paul goldberger ballpark baseball american city","story":"To the critic and author of Ballpark: Baseball and the American City, the buildings dedicated to the game are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it“The ballpark,” Paul Goldberger says, “is a symbolic resolution of two things that remain unresolved in American culture.”The Pulitzer-winning critic is referring to urban and rural life, the city and the country, tensions he explores in his new book, Ballpark: Baseball and the American City.It is an engrossing read, starting in the teeming 19th century, soaring through baseball’s gilded age in the first half of the 20th and ending among the roofs, aircon and policed corporate spaces of the new millennium. It’s a work of architectural history and criticism but it can also be read as a history of baseball or of America and its cities. To Goldberger, the game and the buildings dedicated to it are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it.Discussing baseball’s beginnings, Goldberger says: “It did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus.” It’s an appropriate phrase, as he’s speaking from a Greek island where he’ll deliver a lecture.Versions of the game came together over time. The familiar story that baseball was devised by Abner Doubleday and “played in the fields in Cooperstown, New York”, Goldberger says, is “a longstanding myth that has its roots in a very conscious attempt in the late 19th century to position the game as connected to a more elite and already vanished America”.As he shows, much early baseball was in fact suburban, played in “elysian fields” nonetheless close to the margins of cities. It was rackety and contradictory and competing groups fought to exert control. Like America itself.In the early 20th century the game shifted gears, building beloved city ballparks like Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn and Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Both are gone but in Chicago and Boston, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park continue to pull in the fans.Then came the mid-20th century when the game went national, the stakes were raised and what Goldberger calls “concrete doughnuts”, multi-use stadiums that sacrificed character to the car in seas of suburban parking, were the decidedly soulless result.Baltimore plays a key part in Goldberger’s book, its ballpark, built in 1992, showing how the game returned to the cities.“All types of buildings evolve,” he says. “Airports, hospitals, houses, schools and so on. But they generally evolve in fits and starts and steps, not in one single project after which everything else is completely different. But that certainly was the case with Camden Yards.”Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to give it its full name, replaced Memorial Stadium, a towering suburban venue. The new building did not have to host football too so its architects considered the best of traditional ballparks as well as the fans and their corporate masters. They took an industrial site in a post-industrial city and used it without sacrificing heritage or history.Camden Yards is on an old rail site, which leads to another key point.“While the railroads did not need baseball,” Goldberger says, “baseball needed the railroads. At first the various teams around Brooklyn and New York all played each other and could easily organize that. But you couldn’t organize a regular league with teams in Philadelphia playing teams in Cincinnati, which in turn would play a team in St Louis and Chicago, and Boston, and so forth, without the rise of inter-city train travel. So they went hand in hand.At the end of his book, Goldberger considers the privatisation of public space, a concern in many cities today. He casts an eye over SunTrust Park in Atlanta, an exurban setting where the Braves have built a facsimile of an urban space, ersatz, controllable and financially worth their while.Back in New York, there’s Hudson Yards and a ballpark that never was. The Yankees and Mets looked at the railroad site on the west side of Manhattan but nothing came together. What did open this year: a mesh of condo towers and malls with a sculpture dropped in the middle.Goldberger contends that unlike condos, offices and malls, “baseball integrates beautifully into cities”, which is “really the essential point of the book”. In short, he wishes the Yankees or Mets had succeeded.“I would love to have seen it,” he says. “It would have inoculated the developer very successfully against the not unreasonable claims that Hudson Yards is an enclave for the rich. It would have created a far better reason than Thomas Heatherwick’s sculpture for people to show up, to come there and walk around.“It would’ve left plenty of room for gazillion-dollar condos. It would not have gotten in the way, it would not have presented the programme of Hudson Yards that we now see. It would’ve just been integrated a little bit more effectively, you know?“Imagine if we had had a ballpark instead of a shopping mall, which is the last thing anybody needs or wants.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b821d9772b2dcb264d0aeee42cc0b3ed1afb6d/0_315_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a42cff05c8b572a6abfeb492a76c4eb3","title":"how paris defence zone grew into shantytown in pictures","story":"Exhibition of archive photographs shows how strip of land around Paris, established in 1844 as a defence initiative, became home to 40,000 peopleThe Zone at the Gates of Paris is on display at Croisière, at the Rencontres d’Arles, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f7f4d2e719cd2c6b29dec4a29a2d6e54bec8ff/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0c911d78c18fd28cbe568ecb10f2f90","title":"autumn 2020 no deal britain conservative party","story":"It was Sunday 1 November 2020. The helicopter carrying his hush-hush VIP visitor was expected soon. Staring through the Chequers windows at the lawn where the unmarked Sea King would soon land, prime minister Boris Johnson could hardly believe what he was about to do.Even by his standards, it had been a year of scrapes, of winging it and of close-run things that would have destroyed another leader. In the summer of 2019 he had defeated Jeremy Hunt by an unexpectedly narrow margin. A year ago he had led Britain out of the European Union without a deal.He had been cheered to the echo at the Tory conference. The Brexit party had plummeted in the polls. But things had gone quickly wrong elsewhere. Was it really 12 months already since British lorry drivers fought daily running battles with French customs officers in Calais? How long it seemed since British Airways announced it was relocating to Paris and Barclays moved to Dublin. The mass layoffs following the S\u0026ampP rating downgrade of Britain to BB status were especially traumatic.When the Russian owner of the Belfast Freeport was arrested for fraud in the spring, even he thought his government was doomed. It was probably only the shock royal orce in April, and the postponement of the general election, that had kept the show on the road this long. Just yesterday, two million people had marched through London in protest on the Brexit anniversary.There was a knock on the door. “President von der Leyen is here, prime minister,” the official announced. “Welcome to my Eagle’s Nest,” boomed the prime minister cheerily. The European commission president did not smile. “Let us get down to business, Boris,” she began. “Tell me. Is this serious?” And she placed on the table a file headed “Top secret: UK government application to rejoin”.Well, no, this isn’t entirely serious. Boris Johnson wears his principles more lightly than most. It is nevertheless highly improbable that a man who is currently clawing his way up the greasy pole would brazenly spurn his own cause in such a way. But who can say for sure? The pollster Peter Kellner made a plausible case this week that Johnson could end up calling a second referendum in order to retain power. As Kellner put it: “Changing his mind would be an addition to an already impressive list, not a break with any personal tradition of principled consistency.”It is high time to get serious. Time, so to speak, to take back control. For the past six weeks, the biggest public issue facing this country has in effect been privatised to the Conservative party’s internal processes. The debate about Brexit options has spiralled into a netherworld of faith-based outcomes and fundamentalist beliefs, in which the candidates have made promises they cannot keep about processes they do not control.Meanwhile the rest of us wait meekly for the outcome the Tory members demand. This is an act of collective negligence on the public’s part and an even more dangerous hijack of democracy by the minority of Tory MPs, led by Graham Brady, who successfully forced Theresa May out. Perhaps it will be reversed if Philip Hammond, David Gauke and perhaps even May herself can find a way of working across the House of Commons to stop the renewed drive towards a no-deal Brexit.Rationally, it is political madness to desire no deal. But the leadership contest has narrowed the debate about options, so that the difference between Johnson and Jeremy Hunt on no deal is increasingly difficult to discern. Both candidates know they will not be able to negotiate a new deal. Both have boxed themselves into not seeking an extension. Neither is likely to expend limited political capital trying to finesse a negotiated Brexit through an already uncooperative parliament.The contest has also used up a lot of precious time. The leadership election will be followed by a parliamentary recess, and in turn by the autumn conference season. With the Brussels EU leadership also in transition it becomes increasingly unrealistic to expect the two sides to find any new version of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on which both can sign off, even if they both had the wish to do so. Which neither of them does.This is made more difficult by the continuing levels of what Ivan Rogers, Britain’s former EU negotiator, recently called the “denial, delusion-mongering and deception” that still envelop the Brexit debate. It is inconceivable that the new prime minister will stand on the Downing Street doorstep later this month and renege on the things he has been saying during the contest by warning the public to prepare for difficult compromises. Yet without that, and without an extension beyond 31 October, no deal is not an option. It is automatic.And that means that the UK will be in trouble, short-term or long – or both. Part of this is about tariffs. Mainly, though, it is about the ending of a preferential agreement on trading and commerce within the EU that has no replacement. No deal means no transitional period. This has instant negative consequences for checks on things such as industrial standards, financial regulation, phytosanitary provisions, aviation, road haulage, energy and tax. Why else, for instance, would a lifelong anti-EU politician such as the trade secretary, Liam Fox, now be so anxious to roll over existing EU free trade deals?Speaking on Wednesday at an Institute for Government event in London, legal, business and government experts filled in some of the more immediate practical consequences. Planes will still fly and energy supplies will not be shut off. But the practicalities of trade in goods and, in particular, services (where the UK has a surplus) will alter decisively.Some of this will be immediate. Calais will be a focal point as new checks apply and docks get clogged up. Other impacts will be more gradual as standards erge and forms become more complicated. Both are likely. The free port idea floated by Johnson in Belfast this week would create more barriers, not fewer. The mitigation payments to farmers proposed by Hunt are illegal. Sorting out new arrangements, which will be on EU terms, could take years.So forget about Wimbledon, the women’s football, the cricket and the summer holidays. Grasp instead that this is the month in which the Conservative party will decide to put modern Britain through the economic and political wringer simply in order to save its own skin from the Brexit party. No one voted for this, least of all in 2016. It would surely be better to remain than to have to rejoin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584fd6747157164cff49344aa1564cc3fab64f09/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfe06114ae099661ef39b6469c714590","title":"british museum launches guided tours of lgbtq treasures","story":"Tours will take in objects such as Warren Cup, seen as holy grail of gay historyAn 11,000-year-old carving of a couple making love, a gender-fluid depiction of a Babylonian deity dating from 1800BC and busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous will feature in new LGBTQ-themed guided tours at the British Museum.Around a dozen volunteers will take visitors to see objects also including an Athenian wine amphora with racy images of men getting intimate, and the museum’s most famous gay object, the Warren Cup, a Roman drinking vessel seen as the holy grail of gay history.The initiative builds on LGBTQ audio tours at the museum. “We’ll see how they go, see what the demand is,” said Sarah Saunders, the head of learning and national programmes at the museum. “The more demand there is, the more we’ll do … it is really exciting.”What the objects on the tour all demonstrated, she said, was “that same-sex love and desire and gender ersity have always been an integral part of human experience, but that the way they have been expressed has varied widely around the world and over time.”The oldest object on the tour is the Ain Sakhri Lovers, an 11,000-year-old calcite pebble found in a cave in the Judean desert and made by hunter-gatherers known as Natufians. It is the world’s oldest known depiction of a couple having sex. The genders are unclear and open to interpretation.Considerably more recent, although still 200 years old, are chocolate cups and saucers that belonged to Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, two Irish aristocrats who eloped to Wales in 1778 and are known as the Ladies of Llangollen.The Warren Cup shows two scenes of men making love. It survived because it was buried somewhere near Bethlehem in the 1st century AD, It resurfaced in the 19th century and entered the collection of a rich gay collector, Ned Warren. The museum purchased it in 1999 for £1.8m.Eight solid silver cups cast in the shape of the Warren Cup were unveiled in the museum’s Enlightenment gallery on Thursday. The “Pride cups”, each tinted to represent a different colour of the original Pride rainbow flag, were made by Hal Messel, a silversmith, and will be sold to raise funds for the campaigning charity Stonewall and for the museum’s work with the LBGTQ community.Messel said the project was about “tackling assumptions and raising awareness around how gender identity and sexual orientation continue to remain on the fringes of so much contemporary art.”He said it was interesting to note that the Warren Cup was considered more provocative by some today than it was by the Romans 2,000 years ago.Stonewall’s chief executive, Ruth Hunt, said: “For something as establishment as the British Museum to get behind this is is incredibly powerful. This project has helped spark an important conversation about how attitudes have changes and how much work there is still left to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

As with any clothes, they are a way of presenting ourselves to the world. And for some, that means wearing top hats, breeches, doublets, or Bakelite jewellery. Below, six period dressers explain their choices:These are everyday clothes of the early 19th century. I never leave the house without a hat and I tend to walk around with a cane, too. A lot of what I wear at the moment is Regency style.I’ve been dressing alternatively since I was 14 because modern fashion has never appealed to me. I wanted to look back to a time when things were of a higher quality and wear clothes that would make me stand out. I began wearing late-Victorian and Edwardian stuff bought in vintage shops in Brighton and it made me genuinely happy. I got into the Regency look because I was invited to a Regency ball in London and had nothing to wear. I tried to make something myself, but realised it was terrible since I couldn’t find the right fabrics, so I decided to research the history and develop my own skills.The Regency period was the last hurrah of men’s fun with fashion, when people could be loud with colour and exuberant. The jackets, cravats, trousers – all of it is just wonderful to wear. It’s comfortable, too, and since I make it all myself, it makes me proud to have it on. It’s also a great ice-breaker.My clothes take time and it’s all about learning to be slow, rather than buying into fast fashion, which is unethical and so removed from the production process. You are who you are and you have to get on with it I feel very much at home in what I wear and how I wear it.I haven’t really had any backlash – people have been very inquisitive and polite to me. I don’t see jeans in my future. If anything, I see something more extreme.My style is 1940s and 50s inspired. When I was in my early 20s, I was living in Australia and I started going to secondhand shops because I didn’t have much money. I realised I could buy all the princess dresses that I loved as a little girl cheaply so I started with 1980s clothes and then worked my way back, before settling on the 40s as my style. It’s more comfortable for me and it’s very girly when I cut my hair short, I didn’t want to look boyish, so these clothes are lovely and feminine.When I dress, it makes me feel like myself. I’m in awe of people who look good in just a white T-shirt and jeans, but this style gives me that comfort. Dressing up brings so much joy into my life: sometimes, when I’m sad, I just want to wear colourful clothes because they cheer me up and make me want to go out.In my experience, it’s rare to see people of colour in the vintage scene. I think it might be because we’re already minorities, so we don’t want to draw more attention to ourselves by virtue of the clothes we’re wearing. I grew up with being westernised as the goal, and vintage clothing from my culture highlights the fact that I’m different and, in the current political climate, perhaps sometimes we don’t want to be different.The most important thing is that people wear clothes that are more sustainable and that they use them. Vintage clothes are made to last and it’s made me learn to sew because I have to take care of these clothes – they have survived 80 years and they can’t die in my care.My style is rooted in the 1930s. I always wear trousers with braces, made from a natural material such as cotton or linen, a collarless shirt, a bakerboy cap and leather shoes. I started off doing it because I’m a carpenter and I got a back injury about eight years ago, so there was a practical side to wearing high-waisted trousers with braces that took the pressure off my back and I really liked pairing them with the 30s style.The way I dress led me into 30s culture. I started playing jazz saxophone and got into the dancing of the period, where the clothes really take on a new purpose. It’s nice for iniduals to express themselves in life. I’m not trying to be anything I’m not, I just feel good dressing like this, and it gives other people a sense of who I am. It’s all positive.I’ve always been interested in clothes even when I was at school I had my own sewing machine and I would adapt clothes or paint them. People would give me a hard time because I was an eccentric, but I was determined to be the way I was and now, as an adult, it doesn’t bother me. People don’t have anything to say.Dressing this way is the future – buying fewer clothes and adapting them. We need to value craft and pay someone for doing their job.I dress in 17th-century clothes from the civil war period. I reenact the war and I like the clothes, so I wear them every day. A typical outfit would be a shirt, breeches, doublet, shoes and a hat. I make a lot of my clothes myself and some I buy from traders at re-enactment events. I read books on the patterns of the period and the methods of manufacture and do what I can.Towards the end of the 90s, I was working at a historical property in Wolverhampton and a mate of mine joined a civil war re-enactment society. He persuaded me to come along. Initially, I would only wear the clothes at the re-enactments, but then they started to seep into my everyday wardrobe and, since 2005, I’ve been wearing them all the time. They’re comfortable and I like the style, so I wear it. It means I don’t have to worry about today’s trends. They do for me what any clothes do: provide warmth and avoid nakedness.I’m self-employed as a guide to a National Trust property, which is in a 1930s modernist style, and some people can be a little thrown to have me there in 17th-century clothing to show them around. But most seem not to bother.I don’t tend to get much backlash some people might shout on the street that I look like Robin Hood, but they need to learn their history Robin Hood was dead by 1200 and these clothes were current by 1640. Generally, people just say it looks like fun.I wear clothes from the 1940s and 50s a typical outfit would be a pair of 30s-style culottes with a little blouse, a 40s sweater and wide-legged pants, or a 50s Gypsy skirt. I’ve been into it since I was 14 years old: that was in the 80s when there were a lot of subcultures happening, from mods to punks. I used to look at the mod girls at school and thought they were fantastic – I wanted to be part of the crew. I started out with 60s clothes and moved back to the 50s as a young adult and have settled on it ever since.I just think it’s so much more glamorous and classy – it makes me feel more special when I wear it, because modern clothing can look so tacky and bland. The clothing I wear is much more colourful and vibrant and I’ve always lived with furniture and decorations from that period, too – it’s become my whole lifestyle. We’ve redecorated our house to replicate the 50s style. I couldn’t live in a grey, modern design, I’d be so depressed. Living in the midst of all this colourful mid-20th-century design gives me so much pleasure. This is what I live in and what I wear because it makes me feel good. People say it makes me look younger, too!I collect clothes from the 1930s to the 50s. An everyday outfit would probably be a vintage picture- or border-print skirt with a Gypsy top and Bakelite jewellery.My dad’s an actor and he was really into old movies, so when I was young, we would watch all the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals together on a Sunday. I always wanted to be Ginger Rogers and I always wanted to dance. When I was in my 20s, I discovered a place in central London where you can go lindy hop or jive dancing and, through going there, I met people who dressed this way and knew the places to get the original clothes. I could finally be Ginger Rogers.That was in about 1996 and I’ve been dressing this way ever since. I wish I’d known it existed before that because I definitely would have started earlier.I love this era of clothes – it’s colourful and you feel so good when you dance in it, especially with men in wide-legged trousers. It’s a far more glamorous era than the one we live in now things can feel so scruffy with just T-shirts and jeans around. Wearing those clothes makes me feel as if I’m inhabiting a different time and they’re such exciting, unique pieces to own.It is important to buy clothes that suit you and your shape, which also bring something distinctive to your day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af88e19e2c49ed6d5ac01c9d72946715d3cbdeb7/31_18_1209_726/master/1209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c0cb63705273ccc4c300a044ab4dde","title":"why tv t shirts have become the new band tees","story":"While our chests once showed the logos of our favourite musicians, we’re now more likely to display a Stranger Things graphic or Sheldon’s catchphrase. What is behind the shift? Graphics such as the Rolling Stone’s tongue and lips logo and Guns N’ Roses’ revolver motif are some of the most recognisable band T-shirt’s to date. But, with the popularisation of streaming services such as Netflix and Prime Video, TV shows have become the unlikely competitor, offering an acceptable and fashionable display of telly fandom.With the third instalment to Netflix’s ultra-successful Stranger Things released on 4th July, clothing brands have latched on to the show’s fanbase. Following May’s H\u0026ampM x Stranger Things collection, Levi’s released its own collaboration on 1 July, along with Nike, whose latest Stranger Things rollout arrived the same day, joining Topshop and Pull\u0026ampBear who had previously partnered with the supernatural show.Elsewhere, the popular crime-drama, Narcos, which began as an adaptation of the story of notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar before moving on to cover rival cartels and the Mexican drug trade, has seen the character of Pacho’ Herrera become the inspiration for a custom site of signature retro designs.“The force of social media and the concept of a ‘bio’ means that we’re constantly being made to define ourselves and, while brand logos display our brand loyalty, scenes from TV shows say slightly more about who we are and the type of content we identify with,” says the fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell. “It’s another easy way to say: ‘This is who I am and what I like.’”Forbes-Bell suggests aligning oneself with a TV viewing community is part of the evolutionary desire to form and belong to groups.“Wearing a Game of Thrones T-shirt, for example, can also be seen as a type of signalling behaviour. It almost acts like a beacon to fellow Thronies the T-shirt with a scene from the show is the uniform of the group, strengthening the relationship between fellow fans,” she says.The band T-shirt once had the same powerful ability to consciously reveal a core part of someone’s identity. However, the shift from music graphics to TV shows is indicative of the new ways in which we are now consuming media.“I feel like music doesn’t have the longevity it used to,” she says. “That anticipation for an album to drop and then queuing up to buy the CD, pulling the band poster from a magazine and sticking it on your wall has all been lost. We have more access to musicians via social media, which humanises them, making them less revered, whereas TV shows invite more discourse over a longer period (several seasons long), discourse which is often politicised. They can polarise the public and entice strong emotions from viewers.”One thing that music and TV do still have in common is their ability to inspire die-hard fanbases and key cultural references. But when Friends’ Ross Geller wore a Frankie Goes to Hollywood T-shirt in 1997, who could have known that the character would inspire his own fan tees (often emblazoned with the word “unagi”) some 22 years later?

For a start, it is clear that the studio isn’t keen to allow all of Tony Stark’s fascinating tech to die along with Iron Man. There are more cool Stark gadgets in this movie – from a new AI named Edith to that natty suit-building machine – than in most Iron Man movies. Even Jon Favreau’s Happy Hogan seems to have been permanently transferred from the Iron Man films to Team Spidey, thanks to his budding relationship with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei).Yet Robert Downey Jr’s absence as the genius inventor is palpable. Moreover, he is not the only one of Marvel’s big beasts to have gone missing, and there is a sense that the MCU will never be quite the same for these absences. Stark, Black Widow, Vision and Captain America are listed as deceased in an early scene – even if Captain America’s time-travelling jaunts mean he is probably not officially gone, just retired and super-wrinkly. Thor is off gallivanting through space with the s of the Galaxy while Nick Fury, as that potent end-credits scene reveals, is on his own off-world jaunt. Even Peter Parker spends part of Far from Home doing his best to avoid being an Avenger, before getting inevitably dragged back in to the superhero game.In this uncertain world in which most of the heroes are dead, retired or no longer give a damn, it is no surprise to see Jake Gyllenhaal’s Mysterio raise his bowl-shaped head above the parapet. He is a disgruntled former Stark employee, leading a bucketload of other disgruntled former Stark employees, with an evil plan to convince the world that only he can save it from attack by mysterious Elementals from another dimension, and thereby fill the hero vacuum that has emerged since Iron Man’s death. This he does with the help of high-tech special effects, and the story that he himself also hails from another reality.Set against this nefarious charlatan is Nick Fury’s apparent plan (with the help of Edith) to train Spider-Man up as Stark’s successor. Parker ends the movie with a new girlfriend, MJ (Zendaya), a cool new suit, and the confidence to take advantage of Edith’s many powers. And yet, by the end of the mid- and post- end credits scenes, it seems he may soon find himself in a darker place than ever.First up, the mid-credits scene, in which JK Simmons’s resurrected J Jonah Jameson – now an Infowars-style purveyor of fake video news, rather than the newspaper editor he was in the Sony Spider-Man films – destroys Parker’s reputation and reveals his secret identity with the help of dodgy video edited by Mysterio to show Spider-Man as a villainous aggressor in their final battle. Thanks to this, Parker will be a pariah in the post-Endgame MCU. The public are likely to see him not as the superhero Earth needs but as an evil interloper from another dimension who murdered the planet’s main hope of defending itself (Mysterio) against the next extraterrestrial invasion. It is a bittersweet twist that brutally undermines the main movie’s cheery finale.In the post-credits scene, we discover that Fury had been impersonated throughout the film by shapeshifting Skrull Talos (Ben Mendolsohn), apparently with the former SHIELD supremo’s blessing. If so – and by this point it’s hard to know what to believe – then Fury himself is partly to blame for the entire Mysterio episode. By allowing the Skrull to take his place, he put Parker at risk and set in motion the chain of events that almost led to Mysterio’s plan coming to fruition.And speaking of failures, if Tony Stark really felt it was a good idea to leave a teenager in charge of high-tech weapons of mass destruction (via the Edith sunglasses), could he not have built in a failsafe to avoid them being passed on to somebody else with a less precise moral compass? Did the late, great Iron Man not learn anything from his idiotic Ultron exercise?Perhaps future films will see Spider-Man’s name cleared and his reputation restored. But the overall impression left by Far from Home, despite its ostensibly breezy tone, is of an MCU in which we can no longer trust anything we are told, where all the old certainties have been undermined and where, frankly, all bets are off as to what happens next. Wouldn’t you agree?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67a7c6a9ce4944f4f30d1d0ae56ced0ff1a2d3b/0_348_7157_4295/master/7157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7eecd4cbc1dbb52498ea8fce2dffb7","title":"garlic pineapple pomegranates the definitive guide to peeling 11 of the trickiest foods","story":"Why shell a boiled egg when you can squeeze it out, or use your fingernails on an orange when a knife is quicker? Here’s how to make life in the kitchen much easierWhen the Toronto foodie Valentina Bachkarova-Lord recently posted a video of her favourite way to peel a head of garlic, Twitter went crazy. “ALL THIS TIME??” was the viral reaction, as in: “We’ve been doing it wrong all this time?” Just months before, there was a similar furore over a pineapple-peeling hack in which two manicured hands literally pulled apart a pineapple no slicing or dicing, no juice, no mess. It would appear that – right up there with grumpy cats and happy dogs – peeling produce “the right way” is a surefire means of grabbing the world’s attention.The garlic and pineapple videos have now racked up tens of millions of views (23.8m and 13.4m, respectively). Of course, it is entirely possible that this owes less to culinary curiosity than to our phone addiction. As the New Yorker’s Helen Rosner put it, the videos hit “all the same tension-and-release dopamine levers as (uggghhh) pimple-popping videos”. But that didn’t stop her from stubbornly trying – and failing – to peel a bulb the way the woman in the garlic video did. In fact, it landed her in the emergency room, getting five stitches in her middle finger. So, perhaps Bachkarova-Lord’s method isn’t the right way?Beyond garlic and pineapple, there are hacks for peeling avocados, eggs, ginger, mangoes, onions, oranges, pistachios, pomegranates and potatoes. (Also kiwis: the peeling trick being that you don’t need to peel a kiwi, just eat it whole, like an apple. Bonkers.) But do they actually work? I put 11 to the test.Add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to your boiling water (to increase the alkalinity and make the egg easier to peel). When cooked, run the egg under cold water until just cool enough to handle, then crack at either end to make holes. Now you have two options: if you’re up for a challenge, hold the big end up to your mouth with one hand, and blow hard to catch the egg with your other hand as it flies out of the small end. Or else, squeeze lightly until it plops out. Both work.Instead of shredding your fingertips and breaking your nails trying to pull open nuts that have barely split, use an empty pistachio shell. It is thin enough to slide into any gap, however slim, and hard enough for you to be able to lever it and prise the closed nut open. A revelation.Many a food blogger’s favourite hack: you use the edge of a teaspoon to just scrape the skin off. The spoon gets into all the folds and creases a knife just can’t deal with, meaning you can use the whole root, knobbly bits included. And it is so easy.Not a hack so much as proper chef’s training. Slice the bulb vertically straight down the middle, through the root. Peel the papery outer layers off one half, then lay it flat-side down on your board and, holding firmly by the root, slice from the pointy end to just above the root, keeping the latter intact. Slice again at right angles to these cuts to obtain a pile of perfectly diced onion.The viral video shows someone pulling the fruit apart, segment by easy segment, like you might a cinnamon bun traybake. However, as countless failed attempts to replicate it prove, this only works if you have what’s called a “snack pineapple”, and not the whoppers from Costa Rica sold at Sainsburys and my local street market. Even rolling one of these firmly across your work surface a couple times to loosen the fibres, and scoring it in places before attempting to pull it apart, only results in all the juice on the floor and a mound of unappetising fibres. Nah. Use a knife.Slice in half, then whack the stone head-on with the sharp edge of a big knife and twist and pull the knife out to remove the stone. Then run a dessert spoon between the flesh and skin of each half, to remove intact before slicing thinly. Smoothly does it. Just be careful you don’t end up in hospital.Score a raw spud around its waist in a very light, continuous line, then boil until tender. Once cooked, you’ll see the peel pulling back from the cut, ready for you to slide off in a single movement.By far the most aesthetically pleasing of these culinary hacks. Cut around the calyx – that spiky protrusion on one end – until you can pull it out. You should now see the seeds grouped into segments ided by white membranes. Score the skin of the pomegranate on the outside, from top to bottom, following those membranes. The fruit will then fall open like a flower.The Bachkarova-Lord way – which involves holding a bulb root-side-up, sticking a paring knife into clove after clove and, with a small amount of pressure, twisting them out of their papery sheaths – doesn’t work for me, until I find the YouTube channel Glen \u0026amp Friends Cooking’s explanation. The trick is to first score the unpeeled head, all around the base of the cloves, where they meet the root. Once you have done that, twisting them out, one by one, with your knife is a doddle. But it is only worth doing if you need a heck of a lot of garlic. For a clove or two, pressing with the flat of your knife is perfectly acceptable.Another revelation. Stand your fruit on its end and rotate it so you can slice straight down on either side of the pip to remove it. Hold one of the halves, skin side down, in your palm and work a glass between the flesh and skin from one end all the way to the other. You end up with a satisfyingly solid piece of mango in your glass and a pip you can still suck on, because – let’s face it – that is part of the fun.Slice off both ends of your orange, then set it on one flat end and cut it vertically, from top to bottom into the centre. Then, simply unroll into a flat array of ready-parted segments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5839326e04e3d3ce8a29085047545a5111206e3d/0_215_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d5100f1714e4e086bb8286a8dfe439","title":"so many cocktails so little time my rules of summer drinking","story":"When it comes to boozing in the sun, avoid anything too strong, too colourful or deceptively fruity – and look to the past for inspirationIn Casino Royale, the novel in which Ian Fleming introduced James Bond to the world, the hero ruminates at length about the perfect outdoor cocktail, by which he means summer cocktail. I’ll paraphrase wildly, adding injunctions of my own, since so much of Bond’s alcohol preference is related to his masculinity. Worrying about the size of your dick while you’re deciding on cocktails is the surest way to end up drunk.So, it’s summer: nothing too strong because you’ll be dehydrated nothing too wussy or fruity because they go down too easily nothing too boring because this will likely be your main taste experience of the evening nothing too unnatural in colour, because these are always too sweet and no Pimm’s, for reasons. Bond settles on an Americano: Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda. In that bitters market, I would prefer a Campari and soda: cleaner and fresher without vermouth, and with zero chance that someone will accidentally fetch you a cup of coffee. Let me quickly take down Pimm’s: the problem is not merely that it doesn’t taste like alcohol. It tastes so unlike alcohol that it edges towards the most childish zone of the soft drinks arena, and if you are happy to drink cream soda with bits in all evening, why not do that? Proving, perhaps, that a lot of drunkenness depends on taste, you don’t even feel drunk while you’re drinking it. The first you get to hear about its alcohol content is when you fall over.Sangria is fine to make, but never drink a stranger’s as you never know what you’ll be getting. My Mr makes it with two bottles of red wine, one of rosé, a glass of brandy, two litres of Fanta and frozen berries, producing a solid session drink that I would never argue with. My excellent friend, meanwhile, makes it with all those things, except instead of Fanta, honey. Not two litres of honey, two spoons. This is the opposite of a session drink it’s more like spiking yourself. Yet it tastes exactly like regular sangria, so it’s like spiking yourself invisibly.At the Diageo summer party in Westminster last week – as a globalised drinks company, it ought to know its spirits – there was a negroni fountain. Mishearing that as “Peroni fountain” and expecting something the colour of a very light beer, I went and stuck my glass in the actual fountain, made of water. But that is a perfectly fine misunderstanding. Negronis are, give or take the odd bit of zest and bitters, entirely composed of mostly very strong alcohol, which is the worst thing you can do to yourself, because they are delicious. My dad was a booze oracle: the first job I had was editing a doomed freesheet for students in Earl’s Court, and I gave him a column called the Old Imbiber. All around the pubs of a very small pocket of west London, the bar staff used to go: “I know you, you’re that old imbiber!”, and someone once took a picture of him with his mouth against an optic, which – in the days before cameraphones – was a huge deal, like being Madonna.His wisdom was slightly sullied by the fact that he would drink absolutely anything, and once when he had a cough, he made a cocktail of grappa and Benylin. So I am not saying listen to him on everything, but he had a particular fondness for the whiskey base, which brings us to the mint julep. This is the definitive summer cocktail: terrifically delicious, great pedigree. Signature drink of the Kentucky Derby, where it is always hot and they know a thing or two about drinking for two days straight, it is simple to the point of purity: bourbon, five sprigs of mint, a slug of sugar syrup, heaps of ice. With a glass full of crushed ice, the drink evolves with your conversation, getting weaker as it goes. It’s a sipper but a charmer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb52b9c2a7be240357744e76e2646cde0940220/0_360_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ef64bbb11130df35d3120e8fd10b0b2","title":"womens world cup means so much england usa readers","story":"The tournament has not just broken TV records. It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

Though Bloodworth and Van Veenendaal left the club this summer, the substitute match-winner against New Zealand, Jill Roord, has been recruited.The European champions struggled to qualify for this tournament, doing so via the play-offs, but are now in their second consecutive major final, at only their second World Cup. It has been an impressive rise for a nation that established a domestic women’s league only in 2007.“We are European champions, not just anyone,” Van de Donk said. “I’m very proud of the team, I’m very proud of the Netherlands and I think we came this far as well because we have such amazing support all the time.”Standing in their way are a formidable USA side in a first meeting of the world and European champions in the final. After Alex Morgan sipped tea in celebration of her goal against England, can Van de Donk think of a celebration the USA forward might use against the Netherlands?“I don’t think she’s going to score against us,” she said with a laugh. “We’re going to prove ourselves and show them what we’ve got. We might surprise them.”Bloodworth said the Netherlands have shown they can find the extra gear when needed, having played Italy in scorching 3pm heat in Valenciennes and then a sticky 120 minutes in Lyon against Sweden in the semi-final.“The tournament has been long, the season has been long for a lot of players,” said the centre-back. “You can tell that players are getting tired but at the end it’s just going to be a mental game and giving it a little extra. I think at the end you could see that we had still a little bit in us to fight to the end and it was enough. So we’re just going to continue and hopefully we can do something great on Sunday, as well.”She added of the USA: “We all know they are very confident but we are also very confident.

It has had some notable successes, particularly live. Their marathon gigs, featuring everyone from Paul McCartney to Rizzle Kicks, have been widely acclaimed. And there has been clear, lasting benefit to at least some of the African artists involved: Malian desert blues quartet Songhoy Blues obviously owe their success to their talent rather than anyone’s patronage, but they first came to notice outside of the Bamako club circuit after working with Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner under the Africa Express banner.But the organisation’s albums have thus far been uneven – perhaps inevitably, given the circumstances of their creation. Throwing an eclectic selection of artists together, getting them to jam and trusting that the results will be magical expositions of the universal language of music is a great plan in theory, but the results have usually worked more as an intriguing document of what happened rather than thrilling listening. There have been highlights scattered around tracks that were perhaps more exciting to make than listen to, and a faint but pervasive sense that you really had to be there.The collective’s latest venture involves Albarn, along with Zinner and a suitably erse cast – grime rapper Ghetts and Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys among them – relocating to Johannesburg. It has proved controversial: UK-based artists Nabihah Iqbal and Yannick Ilunga (AKA Petite Noir) both publicly protested about contracts that signed their rights to the music they made away for a nominal £1 fee, the former accusing them of “21st-century colonisation”. Africa Express, a charity, responded by saying that while western artists were expected to give their time for free, African musicians working on their projects were paid, and any profits “go to artists and the promotion of African music”. The musical contents of EGOLI – which don’t seem to feature either Ilunga or Iqbal – should prove less isive.South African pop has enjoyed a fertile and exciting run in recent years. Its own variants on house music, from kwaito to gqom, and on hip-hop, have attracted considerable attention, as has the dense warp-speed electronics of the entirely homegrown shangaan. And there’s a distinct crackle of energy about the collaborations on EGOLI. You hear it on City Lights, where the Mahotella Queens, a veteran mbaqanga trio, team up with Zinner, British producer Georgia and Otim Alpha, pioneer of an electro take on traditional Achioli music. The result is rich, beautiful electronic pop music, a weirdly affecting hint of melancholy audible amid the pacy rhythm track and ravey synth stabs it sounds really commercial without resembling anything you’d hear on Radio 1. No Games, on which Ghetts spars with Port Elizabeth rapper and self-styled “president of female orgasm” Moonchild Sanelly, among a host of others, is equally great: sparse, funky, lightly dressed with marimba.For anyone not familiar with her career (which from afar looks pretty mind-blowing, involving ownership not merely of a clothing line but something referred to in her Wikipedia entry as a “naked club”), Sanelly is very much EGOLI’s breakout star. Your heart leaps a little every time she appears, not least on the remarkable Sizi Freaks, a tense, minimal gqom track over which she offers some forthright bedroom tips – “don’t stop, grab the nuts, don’t crush them, just brush them” – in a blithe sing-song.The album hangs together more coherently than its predecessor Maison des Jeunes, switching from pop-facing to more something subdued and traditional – Gruff Rhys and Zolani Mahola’s acoustic duet Absolutely Everything Is Pointing Towards the Light Muzi, Zola 7 and the Mahotella Queens’ The River – without jolting you. Albarn’s voice is so distinctive it means any track he appears on automatically sounds like Gorillaz, but for the most part you’re struck by how the western artists retreat into the background, as if urging the listener to take more notice of the local talent. It doesn’t feel like an act of grand munificence, more something they’re doing in service to the music. Johannesburg’s hazy R\u0026ampB doesn’t feel like Gruff Rhys performing with some African backing musicians, but something genuinely holistic.Listening to it, or another one of Sanelly’s star turns on Where Will This Lead Us To? (or indeed The Return of Bacardi, a fabulous, warped update on old Chicago house courtesy of DJ Spoko and FAKA) it’s hard not to find yourself thinking that if western pop currently seems a little homogenous and static, there’s a whole world of far fresher ideas out there – and opening one’s eyes to them might be a way forward. That’s presumably the whole point.unperfect – Looking for a HugThe latest girl group project from Xenomania sounds a world away from the brashness of Girls Aloud.

So close yet so far this moment broke a little piece of my heart.“We were the ones that should have been apologising for not having our correct paperwork.”Stone posted images of herself boarding a flight to Iran’s Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, which is an economic free zone that allows travel by all nationalities but can also be a dangerous place for westerners.This year Stone travelled to Syria to perform there, and later said she was “just so glad nothing bad happened”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77af0e11e34bf55878b5b07b68464747f6b12d1e/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=df92ac99a375dc32585c173f88d6bf19 1760w","title":"ann widdecombe likens brexit to emancipation of slaves","story":"Widdecombe becomes first Brexit party MEP to speak in new European parliamentThe former Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe has likened the UK’s departure from the EU to the emancipation of slaves, as she became the first Brexit party MEP to speak in the new European parliament.With her leader, Nigel Farage, on her right, Widdecombe said the recent negotiations among the EU’s heads of state and government over the leadership of the bloc’s institutions confirmed the need for Britain to leave.“It’s not democratic at all and that is just one of many reasons why Britain is right to be leaving this place, hopefully on Halloween,” Widdecombe told a plenary session of the European parliament in Strasbourg. “If that’s this place’s idea of democracy that’s a serious betrayal of every country represented here.”Widdecombe, who was criticised this month for claiming science might “produce an answer” to being gay, said the UK’s departure from the EU equated to a liberation.She said: “There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on their oppressors, slaves against their owners, the peasantry against the feudal barons, colonies against empires, and that is why Britain is leaving … It doesn’t matter which language you use, we are leaving and we are pleased to be going. Nous allons, wir gehen, we are off!”The Brexit party’s MEP for the South East, Alexandra Phillips, tweeted: “Tears in my eyes. She represents the ignored majority. Brave and principled. Our Ann.”Germany’s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, 60, was nominated on Tuesday by leaders including Theresa May to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the next European commission president but she will only take up the role if a majority of MEPs vote in favour of her candidacy.Guy Verhofstadt, the Brexit coordinator for the parliament, expressed his scorn at Widdecombe’s comments.The Liberal Democrat MEP Martin Horwood, who also took part in the debate, said: “To imply that the United Kingdom is any way in a similar situation to the colonies of our former empire or a victim of slavery is deeply offensive. Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism.“If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing section 28.“Ann Widdecombe has not only embarrassed herself, but she has embarrassed the nation she represents. I hope she withdraws her comments and sincerely apologises to all those she has offended immediately.”This week Brexit party MEPs faced criticism for turning their backs when Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the EU anthem, was played in the chamber on the opening day of the five-year term.Widdecombe’s comments followed a speech by Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, who asked parliament to back the leaders’ nomination of Von der Leyen in the commission and of Christine Lagarde as president of the European Central Bank, breaking more than 60 years of male monopoly of the leadership of the institutions.The president is proposed by the European parliament and nominated by the European council of leaders of the EU member states. They lead the commission\u0027s work in implementing EU policies, chair the weekly commission meetings and set its policy agenda. They also represent the EU at European council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and at bilateral summits with third countries.The role was held by Jean-Claude Juncker from November 2014 until July 2019, when the German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, was nominated to replace him.“This is a very positive change,” Tusk said. “Europe is not only talking about women, it is choosing women. I hope that this choice will inspire many girls and women to fight for their beliefs and passions. And I also hope that it will inspire the European parliament in its decisions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c874c3a33ec28c36571249adf9228824e35c2f/0_204_8026_4816/master/8026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50fb94065e17328677206988e9db4a56","title":"jeremy hunt refuses to rule out sanctions against china","story":"Foreign secretary says UK will always put its principles first, as Hong Kong row escalatesJeremy Hunt has refused to rule out imposing sanctions on China and expelling its diplomats in an escalating row over Hong Kong.The foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate warned Beijing that the UK would always put its principles before commercial interests, as he urged China to honour the “one country, two systems” agreement over Hong Kong.Tensions between the UK and China have risen since Hunt backed demonstrators in Hong Kong who have been protesting against an extradition law.On Wednesday China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, accused Hunt of gross and unacceptable interference after Hunt urged China not to use the protests as “pretext for repression”.Hunt ratcheted up the row on Thursday by repeating his concerns and insisting the UK was keeping its options open on how it would respond.“The way to deal with that violence is not by repression, it is by understanding the root causes of the concerns of the demonstrators that freedoms that they have had for their whole life could be about to be undermined by this new extradition law,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Asked twice whether he planned to impose sanctions on China or expel diplomats, Hunt refused to rule out either.He said: “No foreign secretary would ever spell out precisely what would happen in a situation like that. You need what Bill Clinton called ‘strategic ambiguity’.”Speaking a day before ballot papers are expected to arrive at the homes of 160,000 Tory members, Hunt lashed out at editorials in state-run media accusing him of putting “selfish” political interests above good relations with China. Hunt said he was not surprised by Beijing’s reaction and claimed: “China specialises in this kind of language.”He added: “Hong Kong is part of China, we recognise that. We are simply saying that we also have an agreement with the People’s Republic of China, and we would expect that to be honoured.“China is a country that has benefited massively from the application of a rules-based international system. And so to not to honour this very important agreement between the United Kingdom and China, of course, would have consequences for China as well as for the UK.”Hunt said the situation in Hong Kong was “very, very serious”. He added: “We are a country that has championed democracy, the rule of law, civil rights across the world for much of our history. We see the situation as very worrying. And we’re just asking very simply for that agreement that we have with China, from 1984 to be honoured.”Asked whether the UK had too many economic interests at stake to pick a fight with China, Hunt said: “If you’re asking me about the the trade-off between our trading relations and our principles, in the end this is a country that has always defended the values we believe in and we think it’s a very important principle that international agreements are honoured.”His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u0027underestimated\u0027 entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u0027Theresa in trousers\u0027 nickname among some Tory MPs.His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q\u0026ampA session as a direct response to Johnson\u0027s refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u0027sensible tax incentives\u0027 to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.Hunt played down his pledge on Wednesday to allow a vote on bringing back fox hunting. He insisted this would not be his priority and added: “The law is not going to change on fox hunting.”He said: “There isn’t a majority in the House of Commons and I don’t see there ever being one. I was just restating the position in our manifesto from 2017 that there should be a free vote if it ever looked like that majority would change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ac088a33ad0beb6c68156af9809188b113fa3b/0_139_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673cc57dcd698ae90c38786bc1dbbcb8","title":"england v australia womens ashes second odi live","story":"10th over: England 38-1 (Beaumont 19, Knight 13) Spin for the final over of the first power play, via left-armer Jess Jonassen. Singles are exchanged early in the over to the sweeper at cover. Given a bit more depth later in the set, Knight uses the crease and crunches behind point for four. Shot. Jonassen bounces back though, slipping a straight one past the captain’s inside edge. They’re up for leg before but the appeal is turned down. Of course, we have no DRS in this series. Grrrrr. 9th over: England 32-1 (Beaumont 18, Knight 8) Schutt oversteps first up, which is most unusual. Beaumont gets a fair of the free hit but not quite enough to reach the rope, a ing stop from Lanning denying the fourth. The skipper wouldn’t be denied getting a boundary of her own later in the over though, Knight creaming an overpitched delivery through extra cover for four. Nice, positive batting.8th over: England 23-1 (Beaumont 15, Knight 3) Beaumont takes one to third man early. Perry is up for leg before to Knight but it is quickly turned down. The captain picks out the fielders on the circle a couple of times but is unable to pick the gap.Speaking of the captain. ‘Heather’s Pride’ took place last week, which was a competition where lettersvideos were sent in by kids explaining why they should get a training session with England. By all reports, it was a lovely day. Here are the competition winners alongside Knight, Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole.7th over: England 22-1 (Beaumont 14, Knight 3) Beaumont takes a run off Schutt after a couple of maidens from her end, on the front foot to mid-on. Knight grabs a couple around the corner to get her moving in the right direction. These two have an even bigger job ahead of them than usual today with Sarah Taylor missing.6th over: England 19-1 (Beaumont 13, Knight 1) Beaumont leaps onto a short and wide delivery, cutting her third boundary off Perry. She’s then down the other end via a steered single to third man. Good batting. They’re giving the home skipper nothing when she’s on strike, Knight again playing out the remainder of the set.5th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Schutt is bowling into a shoebox. It isn’t always easy to get into that groove early as a swing bowler but it is exactly what the South Australian has done early on here. Knight is forced to make a good decision from each delivery, and does, playing out another maiden. 4th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Perry gives Beaumont a full toss on her pads and she makes no mistake putting it away through square leg to get off the mark. She makes it two boundaries in the over from the final delivery, crashing a half-volley through cover. Beaumont’s away. 3rd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Schutt is right on the money here, bouncing in after that familiar squat at the top of her mark, ala Rubel Hossain from the Bangladesh men’s team. A maiden it is, Knight in defence throughout. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Such a poor start for Jones, who has had a brilliant nine months or so. This is the series she has been longing to play in and dominate. She’ll have to wait for Sunday now. Earlier in the over, she picked up a boundary off Perry’s first ball down to fine leg. With Taylor missing, the captain Heather Knight shuffles up to No3. She was out first ball to Perry on Tuesday, lbw, but is off the mark first up today, with a tuck behind square. Back to back soft dismissals for Jones, chipping a catch to midwicket. 1st over: England 1-0 (Jones 0, Beaumont 0) Tidy from Schutt to begin, line and length to Jones who is happy to get her eye in with the full face of the blade in defence. She is off the mark from the final delivery down to fine leg for the easiest of singles. Plug Schutt’s column again? I will. The discussion about how the Australian dressing room has changed from 2017 is really interesting. The players are on the field! Megan Schutt has the ball in her hand, running away from us at the the broadcast or Bennett end. Amy Jones will be facing the first ball, Tammy Beaumont opening the batting with her. PLAY! It is an ankle niggle. Official word from the England team: “Sarah Taylor injured her ankle in the first ODI and hasn’t recovered in time to play today.”Dave Lawrence opening up on the emails. “Greetings! Looking forward to another exciting Ashes ODI.” Good afternoon to you. Let’s hope for a high-scoring thriller. “Re: the multi-format series, would you not rather see a higher points weighting for the Test Match and lesser for the T20s? Or perhaps an extra test with one fewer of each of the limited overs formats?”My fix: ODIs 3, Test 5 (two each for a draw), T20s 2. Reduces the likelihood of an even scoreline and reflects the fact that winning an ODI is harder than a T20.“It is important that we move on quite quickly,” she says. “I asked for some fight in the last game after the bad start we had, which was brilliant. But not enough.”Sarah Taylor is out. She has a niggle. Danni Wyatt comes into the XI for her. Amy Jones will ‘keep for England, as she does whenever Taylor misses out.Meg Lanning says that Australia would also have batted too “but we’re comfortable chasing whatever they set us.” They are unchanged from Tuesday. In front of my OBO position, the England superstar ‘keeper hasn’t got the gloves on and doesn’t appear to be warming up. We’ll find out what’s going on there at the toss in a couple of minutes. Welcome to Leicester for the second Women’s Ashes ODI! It’s a glorious day here at Grace Road, where surely the successful captain at the toss will bat. It is a used pitch as well - the same strip that was played on when Australia got over the line by two wickets on Tuesday - so it will doubtless take to turn as the day wears on. The hosts were abysmal early with the bat in the series opener, slumping to 419 and eventually skittled for 177. All that stood between them and a double-digit tally was all-rounder Nat Sciver (64) and No10 Sophie Ecclestone (27 in 27 balls).But to their credit, they clung on. As Megan Schutt says in her column, which I’ll post below, the reason why Australia value wins over England so highly is that Heather Knight’s side do not give up. When numbers nine and ten came together in Australia’s chase they still had 11 to get. Aside from Alyssa Healy (66), there was very little that was convincing about Australia’s chase. It sets today up well.A reminder on how the multi-format points system before we get going: each of these three ODIs are worth two points, the standalone Test in Taunton later this month has four points on the line, the three T20s a further two to finish. It works quite nicely. As does the OBO when we talk throughout. Drop me a line! Hello!

You can pick up a Nokia 105 (2017 edition) for about £15 or a dual-sim Nokia 106 (2018 edition) for about £16. These are only 2G phones but they have built-in FM radios, they can send texts, they are great for making phone calls and they are not based on Google or Apple technologies. A 3G or 4G phone would cost a bit more …This answers your question but it is obviously not the solution you are looking for …The problem is that most people – including me – want to use Googly things on their phones. Gmail is the dominant email service, YouTube is the dominant short video provider, Google Search and Google Maps are very useful and Google Chrome is the most widely used web browser. There may be viable and sometimes preferable alternatives but you have to make an effort to use them. Most people don’t want to make the effort.Indeed, it looks as though the next generation of candy-bar phones will also include Google. Nokia’s latest 4G feature-phone, the Nokia 8110 “banana phone”, runs the KaiOS operating system, in which Google has invested $22 million. The Alcatel Go Flip 2, JioPhone and Orange Sanza are alternative KaiOS phones available in North America, India and Africa respectively. (Kai is named from the Chinese word for open, not the undead protagonist in the Lexx science fiction series.)KaiOS includes WhatsApp – its main selling point – plus a web browser, Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps and Google Assistant. It’s claimed to be the second most popular operating system in India and could manage that in Africa. Some KaiOS phones cost less than $20.KaiOS started as a fork of B2G (Boot to Gecko), which was an open source continuation of Firefox OS, which Mozilla stopped developing at the end of 2015. Gonk, the operating system underneath Gecko (which is Firefox’s web-rendering engine) is a small Linux kernel derived from Google’s AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.The fact that we have, essentially, a duopoly in the smartphone business is not for want of trying. Microsoft entered the market with a version of Windows running on ARM-based smartphones and it even made Windows available free on small-screen devices. The people who owned Windows phones seemed to love them and in 24 countries it overtook Apple’s iPhone in market share. However, the lack of apps was a major stumbling block and Microsoft abandoned its challenge, having lost billions of dollars in the attempt.You can still buy Windows phones but most date from 2015-16 and will soon be out of support. I didn’t recommend buying them when they came out so I really wouldn’t recommend one now.Canonical also had a go at the smartphone market with its Linux-based Ubuntu Touch. It failed. In this case, the development was taken over by the UBports Community, which developed a port for the OnePlus One smartphone in 2015. There are now a few others but I don’t expect Ubuntu Touch phones to appear in your local high street.South Korea’s two smartphone manufacturers, Samsung and LG, would also love to have an independent operating system but success is unlikely. Samsung tried with Tizen, which was supported by the Linux Foundation. The Samsung Z series was launched in India and didn’t do well enough but Tizen is used in Samsung Gear smartwatches. LG could have a go with Palm’s Linux-based webOS, which it acquired from HP in 2013. WebOS first appeared on Palm Pre smartphones in 2009 but LG has mainly used it in smart TV sets.Sailfish started with another failed Linux project, Nokia and Intel’s MeeGo. The latest version uses a graphical shell from Jolla, the Finnish company that appears to be its major backer. Sailfish can be ported to more alternative smartphones than Ubuntu Touch but I can’t see any current phones with Sailfish pre-installed. The same is true for both e (formerly Eelo), which is a sort of de-Googled Android, and LineageOS, which is a reborn CyanogenMod.You main hope is Purism’s forthcoming Librem 5, which seems to be exactly what you want. Whether it can buck the trend remains to be seen.In general, the problem with Linux on smartphones looks much like its problem on PCs. Many and various groups enjoy developing new versions of the operating system, which are all more or less doomed from birth. None of them have the skills, the interests or the money to create viable platforms that include the hardware, apps, services, packaging, marketing, advertising, distribution and support on the sort of scale needed to sustain a real product. Without those, they are unlikely to attract much interest beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts.Things may change thanks mainly to the current American president. Trump sent China and the rest of the world a wakeup call by trying to exclude Huawei – the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer and the leader in 5G – from using American technology. Huawei was already developing its own Android app-compatible operating system, currently known as Hongmen OS, as an alternative. The potential loss of up to $30bn in sales per year suggests there will be no shortage of money or manpower for its future development.Indeed, China has a powerful incentive to replace all the American technology it uses with home-grown alternatives. This may take decades but in the long run, it will hurt Google, Intel, Qualcomm and numerous other US companies. The genie is out of the bottle and the Americans will never be able to put it back.Hongmen, aka Ark OS, may not have a lot of appeal in Europe but it could do well in Asian countries that already do more trade with China than with the US.Meanwhile, the EU’s latest antitrust case against Google should allow phone manufacturers to offer alternative browsers and search engines. It should also enable Android smartphone suppliers to sell phones with alternative versions of Android in Europe, which Google did not allow them to do before. A major player such as Samsung or Huawei could therefore test the market with a Google-free Android phone. In which case, you can vote with your wallet.A recent Washington Post story based on Disconnect.me technology found trackers were rife in the journalist’s iPhone apps. Google, of course, banned Disconnect Mobile from its Play store way back in 2014. In a blogpost, the company wrote: “Google refuses to explain their decision, other than to say that our app won’t be allowed if it interferes with any ads even ads that contain malware and steal your identity.”The app economy, like the web economy, is ultimately based on surveillance. That isn’t likely to change unless the EU does something about it. And so far, despite the GDPR and three antitrust cases against Google, the EU has left smartphone tracking revenues unharmed.Have you got a question?

Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

She is on the Board of Trustees for Marlens, the charity that looks after the Marine Lake and a member of the South West Seals winter swimmers.“Not renowned for its swimming, the Somerset coastline is characteristically brown and turgid. Clevedon has a historic bathing tradition – the famous Long Swim is now in its 91st year – while Clevedon Marine Lake has just marked its 90th birthday. Swimming from Clevedon beach feels like being part of the town’s fabric. You can only swim here around high tide but the joy of this small window is that all of Clevedon’s sea-swimming community comes together. Clevedon has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, never letting the silty sea bed settle and this makes conditions variable. Depending on conditions and tide, you can swim under the pier’s legs or around its end. You will always come out smiling.”Refuel Survived the silty swim? Get the most epic bowl of porridge, a decent bacon sandwich or, of course, cake at Scarlett’s, just by the pier on Alexandra Road.Swimming and documenting beautiful places is Anna’s job: as a photographer she has swum across Scotland snapping other swimmers. She is well known in her tribe, the Wild Ones in Edinburgh. They swim every Sunday at the local beach Wardie Bay. Taking The Plunge: The Healing Power of Wild Swimming for Mind, Body and Soul by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan will be published in November 2019 by Black \u0026amp White Publishing.“I have swum in some extraordinary places but my favourite is closer to home, Gullane. The beach is on a stunning piece of coastline than runs from Edinburgh to the Borders. There are beaches after beaches but Gullane has everything: it stretches on for what seems like miles, there are amazing rockpools, sand dunes to run down, secret caves to explore and, best of all, beautifully clear sea. There have been dolphins spotted and, sometimes, minke whales have made an appearance.”Refuel Seek sustenance in Drift, an old shipping container perched on the headland with a view over to Bass Rock, huge windows and brilliant cakes.You might not know her name but you may have heard about the St Ives Mermaid: Laura Evans. She swims daily, often found leaping off the harbour wall or washed up with her tail at beaches around the Cornish town, delighting children and adults alike.“West Penwith – from Porthmeor Cove to Nanjizal – is my favourite stretch of coastline. The landscape seems to change as you round every headland: from granite formations to lush greenery surrounding old mining ruins. There are secluded coves and tidal pools, meaning you are spoilt for choice when it comes to seeking a swim and more often than not you will have it all to yourself. I love Porth Nanven, also known as Cot valley and Dinosaur Egg Beach it’s named due to the sea turning the granite into ovals.”• Laura has recently founded a new St Ives Swimmers group – why not join them if you’re staying nearby?Refuel After seeking dinosaur eggs, carry on down the South West Coast Path to Sennen Cove and grab a pint at sunset in the Old Success Inn.Jane is a member of the Alnwick Sea Swimmers and swims all seasons in the North Sea off the Northumberland coast. She tries to go daily and often organises longer-distance swims from the Farne Islands or to Holy Island. From the mainland to Holy Island is just under a mile in distance but challenged by strong currents, so Jane organises support for those who wish to swim the stretch.“I am incredibly lucky. The stretch of coastline I swim is mostly in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. White sandy beaches, clean water, wildlife – and mostly free parking! The beaches are often deserted and I often have the company of seals, birds and occasionally dolphins if I’m really lucky. Among my favourites is Football Hole, one of Northumberland’s secrets. It is a bit of a walk but no one else is ever there. I mostly swim parallel to shore but, when the tides permit, I swim down the River Aln. My absolute favourite place to swim is off the Farne Islands.”Refuel Exploring the coastline on an empty stomach is a mistake – enjoy the local sausages in the Northumberland Full English at the Salt Water Cafe, Beadnell – worth a detour off the A1.Kent Sea Swimmers covers a huge stretch of coastline, dipping at 11 bays and beaches from Seasalter to Hythe. Anthony joins at least every other weekend, and all year around.“Tankerton offers grassy banks full of beach huts, which make it one of the most attractive places to look back to from the sea. At high tide, the water is a good swimming depth without being too far from the shore. At low tide, the sea goes a long way out and you can walk out to a Tudor shipwreck or along The Street – a shingle spit that stretches far into the sea. If it’s rough then you know it is and when it’s calm, as it often is, then it doesn’t throw any surprises at you. There is a current to swim against but it pulls you along the beach rather than out to sea. This means you can swim with it, at speed, or challenge yourself against it, which makes it all the more fun!”Refuel After swimming against the current, have breakfast at the Seaview Café. It opens early on a Sunday and it is right on the seafront.Colin has recently become the first man (the first person was a woman) to swim a solo crossing of the Big Minch, the sea between the Outer Hebrides and Scottish mainland. He runs the Hebridean Sea Swimmers group and swims in the sea two to three times a week.“My favourite place to swim on the Isle of Lewis is Giordail beach in the village of Tolsta. It has a host of different formations along the coast, including the old pier and a waterfall. There’s also sea stacks to swim around, a natural arch and a tunnel to swim through – although you really need a local swim guide to show you how to find them safely, as the coastline is rugged with not many exit points.”Refuel Take your own hot drink but stop off at the Blackhouse Bakery for freshly made and tasty bakes. Colin recommends the pie!Lisa’s favourite time of day to swim is at sunrise before work, swimming with a group of sea lovers comprising a combination of breaststrokers to serious head-down channel swimmers. She used to swim daily but now swims as much as possible since becoming a mother.“Southwold is my favourite beach by far as this is now my home and has been for the past four years. As soon as I moved here I was swimming most days along the beach. Eventually, I was joined by other swimmers and Suzie’s Beach Café became our HQ. It’s fabulous swimming to the pier, looking back at the town in all kinds of weather conditions, measuring our distance by the number of groynes or crow’s nests we have swum past.”Refuel Made it to the pier? Grab a coffee and bacon roll in Suzie’s Beach Café – or, if an afternoon swim is more your thing, the scones are amazing.Marie set up the Brompton Belles \u0026amp Beaux Dippers so she could sea-swim daily, close to home and with others. They swim in a small cove called Jenny Watt and out to Belfast Lough. Marie goes out with the dawn swimmers – in the dark come winter.“The north coast is known as the Causeway Coast, it is where I learned to swim, in a sheltered bay called Cushendun. It is in the heart of the Glens of Antrim and is a quiet spot with the sounds of sheep and the lapping of waves. At one end of the sandy, kelp-strewn beach lies the red pudding stone cavearch favoured by geologists and at the far end the dramatic headland leading towards Torr Head.”Refuel Sea swimmers run the Coffee Cure cafe near Jenny Watt Cove, but if you’re visiting Cushendun, duck into Mary McBride’s for a Guinness and locally sourced grub.Cheryl is known locally for her cafe at Lligwy Beach but recently has put the spot on the map since founding a swimming club. They meet every Wednesday and Sunday and often take new recruits out to introduce them to the joy of the sea.“Lligwy is shallow shelving with golden sand and is usually sheltered from the typical south westerly-prevailing wind. Although, if a northerly system blows through it can get rather bouncy, creating waves to play in. We frequently swim with inquisitive seals – there is a colony of Atlantic greys on a rocky outcrop a mile or so from the beach. We swim along the shoreline often in clear, blue water. Spring is my favourite time when the terns and gannets are ing all around us.”Refuel Swim with the Lligwy Beach Cafe Swim Club and then e into the cafe for hot chocolate, chat and cakes baked by Cheryl’s daughter. The Rocky Road is epic.Swimming group, Beyond the Blue, was founded by Sally almost six years ago, and she and her party swim all year round from Shore Road near Sandbanks. In winter they share the cost of a beach hut and can be found huddled around a kettle after cool dips.“Shore Road is my favourite. A lovely sandy beach where getting into the sea is easy, no steep gravel slopes or rocks once you are in. Of course, there are many amazing places to swim all along this coastline: Studland, Chapman’s Pool, Kimmeridge, Worbarrow Tout, to name a few – especially for the more adventurous.”Refuel Head to the Middle Beach Cafe, which provides great food and views across the beach.

But now a US show has planted a flag on the channelKids have never had such exposure to international culture. On Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, they can feast on a non-stop deluge of American teen sitcoms and animation. On Netflix, their choices heave with Spanish, Japanese, Polish, German and Hindi programming. If you are brave enough to let them watch YouTube, they can get their fill watching poorly made and genuinely disturbing Estonian footage of zombie bears trapped in a destructive cycle of compulsive behaviour.For the most part, however, the BBC refuses to succumb to such frivolous globetrotting. The programmes it selects for children are almost entirely British in design and execution. CBBC has Danger Mouse and Blue Peter and Horrible Histories. Its younger cousin, CBeebies, has Octonauts and Teletubbies and Bing who, quite frankly, would end up marooned on a floating prison barge if he tried pulling any of those antics in another country. They are British shows for British people, and if it so happens that they are not entirely British-made shows – like that ropey CGI Peter Rabbit series – at least they have the decency to re-dub the whole thing with British accents.Except that isn’t the case any longer. As of today, CBBC is the home of Holly Hobbie a Canadian-US Hulu series that couldn’t be any less British if it underwent a round of expensive tooth-whitening surgery. It is set in small-town America. It is produced by American Greetings Entertainment. Its cast is entirely North American. It is based on the life of a real American illustrator who made her fortune by selling her likeness to a range of deliberately folksy dolls, which is just about the most American thing I have ever heard. There is simply no way to disguise how intrinsically American Holly Hobbie is.And that’s quite rare. Ofcom demands that the overwhelming majority of programming on CBBC be original and UK-commissioned so, aside from a smattering of movie spin-off cartoons and the occasional stupid prank show, it’s almost completely impossible to hear an American accent on CBBC these days. When you do, it can’t help but stick out.Which isn’t to say that Holly Hobbie doesn’t fit on CBBC. It absolutely does. Holly is the sort of girl who, when confronted with sheep in the road, cycles up to them and says: “Beep beep.” She sells muffins in her grandmother’s cafe after school. She finds herself permanently adjacent to endless Little League games. If the show was any more wholesome, it would die of constipation. As such, it slots right in to the CBBC schedule.But part of me wonders whether the sheer Americanness of Holly Hobbie is a step too far. American shows are everywhere right now. If you’re a kid with even the slightest ability to channel-hop in 2019, you will be inundated with American shows wherever you look. They’re not all bad – in fact, in the case of something like Netflix’s Ask the StoryBots, they can be world-beatingly great – but they are ubiquitous nonetheless.Until now, the BBC’s childrens’ output felt like a respite from that it felt like an oasis of smaller, homelier shows that you could put on whenever you got worried that your child was about to start saying “zee” or “fire truck”, or using the incorrect number of syllables to pronounce the word “aluminium”.It’s always good, especially when you are young, to see a version of yourself reflected onscreen. For the most part, the BBC is tremendous at providing that for British children. Its shows have a grounding in place that would be missed if it just imported programmes wholesale from elsewhere. It would be a shame for CBBC to lose such a delightful niche by shipping in more US shows such as this. So, as needlessly confrontational as this is going to sound on Independence Day, Holly Hobbie should think about going back to where she came from."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1a14a5a69fdc4db435a9a9cdc873bb63fb39f1/0_24_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75f53b6695a3af4684cf79feecb67bd","title":"ice cream los angeles instagram influencers","story":"Joe Nicchi has had enough of self-proclaimed influencers wanting free cones for publicity. Now he’s the one going viralCustomers at Joe Nicchi’s ice-cream truck have increasingly had the same demand: give us your ice-cream for free.CVT Soft Serve, a popular truck in Los Angeles, has started to receive weekly requests from self-proclaimed Instagram “influencers” who promise to post a photo of Nicchi’s ice-cream – if they don’t have to pay. Nicchi has always said no, but this week he found an unusual way to profit off of the influencers: he publicly told them to go away.Nicchi went viral after posting a sign that said “influencers pay double”, writing on Instagram that he would “never give you a free ice-cream in exchange for a post”. The image, tagged #InfluencersAreGross, spread around the globe, and now Nicchi says his business is booming, attracting fans across southern California who share his disdain of influencers.“We’re the anti-influencer influencers,” he told the  on Wednesday. “It’s weird … but I think it’s really fun. I hope it inspires small businesses to hold their own and tell people to fuck off.”Some brands and businesses now rely on Instagram “stars” to advertise their products and services, giving away free meals and hotel stays to people who post positively about the experience. The phenomenon has become so pervasive that some Instagrammers can easily scam companies. One Instagram influencer recently staged a “surprise” wedding engagement but had actually sent an itinerary to marketers months prior. It’s so trendy to be an influencer that some people have taken to pretending their content is sponsored when it’s not.Nicchi understands the importance of promotion. He’s a working actor in LA, who started CVT Soft Serve in 2014 as a way to supplement his income.“This is a money-making thing. I can’t give away my ice-cream for free,” he said, noting that he had paid for his first truck with his salary from shooting a commercial.The soft serve at CVT (which stands for his three flavor offerings: chocolate, vanilla, or twist) and his vintage-looking truck are very Instagrammable. Influencers quickly noticed. In his first year, he got a small handful of influencer offers, typically people emailing suggesting promotional deals in exchange for free ice-cream.“They love using the word ‘exposure’. It’s so ridiculous,” he said.But the frequency of the requests began to escalate – and became more uncomfortable as they started happening in person, said Nicchi: “The most painful thing for me is when they approach me at the truck.”It never made sense to him: “Are you out of your mind? This is four dollars. But obviously they wouldn’t be asking if people weren’t saying yes.”At times, the requests were particularly offensive. He said an assistant to a famous actor – a woman on a television show who he declined to name – recently asked if he would donate ice-cream to the cast and crew. In exchange, the actor offered to take a photo at his truck.His response: “As much as I’d love to do that, I don’t think my kid’s school accepts celebrity photos as a form of tuition payment.”The assistant responded with a nasty and vaguely threatening message, he said, along the lines of: “I should be careful with my words … This is a very small town.”Nicchi eventually became so tired of influencers that he put up his anti-influencer sign at the truck, making clear that people who requested a free cone would get the opposite – they’d have to pay $8 instead of $4. A customer took a photo and posted it to Reddit, which then went viral.He said he had since gotten interview requests and news coverage from across the world, and he is loving it. The number of customers doubled overnight, and he has earned thousands of new followers on Instagram.“There’s something so redeeming about outing influencers,” he said, adding that many small businesses have written to him thanking him for speaking up. “I hope that more people do not allow likes and comments and followers to hold weight in the business. I want people to go to a restaurant because the food and service is fantastic.”Brittany Hennessy, an author who has written about influencers, said companies with marketing budgets can benefit from working with social media personalities, and that a giveaway can pay off. But a small food truck may not a good fit, she said: “People will try and get anything for free … No real influencer would ask for a four-dollar ice-cream.”While Nicchi is happy to promote his own business on social media, he said he didn’t want to depend on the platform. “If Instagram went away tomorrow, our truck would still survive. I don’t know that your ‘influencer’ business would.”Nicchi offered to let the  try his ice-cream, under one condition: that the reporter pay for the cone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb3bfc6efaf1e15c969c39a6beea1529d557c82/28_163_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17131d0c88f628b81c6631b8c3ffc2a","title":"is a new generation taking over the democratic party podcast","story":"Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US.

I’m good. I’m very good.”.Speaking in Perth, his father, Gary Sigley, said the family were “over the moon” that his son was safe, saying he understood his son had been “in constant good spirits and well the whole time”.Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Sigley’s release would not have happened without the help of Sweden.Sigley’s detention was confirmed overnight by the Swedish envoy to North Korea, Payne told 2GB radio.“The timeline was very tight and very short, and without the support and help of our counterparts in the Swedish government this would not have been possible, so we are deeply deeply grateful to them,” Payne said.The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had given the first public confirmation that Sigley was safe, telling parliament on Thursday afternoon that the 29-year-old had been released from detention by the repressive regime and had arrived safely in China.“We were advised that the DPRK have released him from detention and he has safely left the country and I can confirm that he has arrived safely.“On behalf of the Australian government I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the Swedish authorities for their invaluable assistance in securing Alek’s prompt release, which demonstrates the value of discreet behind-the-scenes work by officials in solving sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments.Sigley’s father told reporters outside his home in Perth he was “over the moon” to hear his son was safe.“On behalf of Alek’s family we are extremely pleased that Alek now is safe and sound in Beijing,” Gary Sigley said. “I’m sure he will reunited with his wife very soon and we hope to see him in the not-too-distant future as well and give him a big hug and kiss.He said he had missed a call from his son while he was shopping and had not yet been able to speak to him, but that he understood he had been “in constant good spirits and well the whole time”.Sigley was expected to travel to Tokyo, where his wife Yuka Morinaga lives, later on Thursday.  The Swedish special envoy arrived in Pyongyang earlier this week. Payne said on Wednesday that Australia had asked the envoy to raise Sigley’s case with the North Korean government.Sigley had been studying for a master’s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung university, and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. He first traveled there in 2014.He was believed to be the only Australian living in North Korea.In March, Sigley wrote for  Australia about his experience living there, saying that as a long-term foreign resident on a student visa he had “nearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang”.“I’m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me,” he said. “Interaction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.”It remains unclear why Sigley was detained. Richard Broinowski, a former Australian diplomat to South Korea, told ABC radio he did not think Sigley had been doing anything that would “raise North Korean suspicions”.“I’d be very doubtful he had anything to do with espionage,” Broinowski said. His detention might have been related to the summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last week, but that was also unlikely, Broinowski said.He said Australia should reopen a diplomatic posting in North Korea.“I think it’s always a good thing to have diplomatic accreditation in the country that you want to influence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc64aaa29ba16c99eccfbeb88651ff38321500/0_37_5928_3558/master/5928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d17d3167e49235b0fd73104485922e0","title":"amsterdam mayor considers closing red light district","story":"City’s first female mayor aims to tackle human trafficking, fraud and money launderingAmsterdam’s first female mayor is considering closing down the city’s famous red-light district due to the conditions endured by the sex workers behind its windows.Femke Halsema, a former leader of the national Green party who became burgemeester last year, said the city “must dare to think about the red-light district without prostitution”.It is one of the options on which the mayor will open a consultation over the summer with the aim of tackling human trafficking and reducing the number of tourists in the narrow alleys and canalside streets of the Singel and De Wallen parts of the town.“These goals are not negotiable,” Halsema told the city’s newspaper Het Parool. “For a long time, there was a sentiment of sailors around the red-light district who, after months of sailing, go to a ‘stout’ Dutch woman. The situation now is that predominantly foreign women, of whom we do not know how they ended up here, are laughed at and photographed.”“Trafficking in human beings takes place in the most beautiful and oldest part of our city,” she added. “Over the course of a few hundred years, situations have arisen that are not acceptable.”Halsema said the women behind the red-light district’s 330 windows had become just another tourist attraction for people visiting Amsterdam.“They are laughed at, often called names and photographed against their will,” she said. “In addition, human trafficking, fraud and money laundering must be reduced, and thirdly, I want less inconvenience for residents and entrepreneurs. It must be quieter, cleaner and more livable there than now.”Beyond closing down the red-light district entirely, other possible options include a ban on the brothel windows while allowing sex work to continue, the relocation of some of the windows or, finally, opening more windows to reduce demand but potentially setting up turnstiles on certain streets “so that you shield off pieces of public space for passersby who don’t need to be there”.Debates on the issue are to be held next week in the city centre’s Compagnietheater. Later in the summer, “stakeholders” will be asked for their views with the hope of reducing the possible options to two for consideration by the council.The Greens hold 10 of the 45 seats on the council but the party has secured the support of the liberal D66 group and the Socialists for its preference for moving sex work on from the city centre.Halsema has declined to say which of the policies she supports.“Modern leadership serves and is not dictatorial,” she said. “The discussion about prostitution is now very polarised and moralistic. Prostitution is a historical phenomenon in the city centre. It takes time and money to do something about it. Consensus is needed for that, but the final decision lies with the college and the council. I lead the discussion.”Halsema said that she was “pragmatic” and would not challenge the right for women to be involved in sex work in Amsterdam.Should the red-light district close down, the council would consider establishing in other parts of the city “prostitution hotels where sex workers rent a room and where only visitors come to make use of their services”, she said.“Yes, that will probably be accompanied by a lot of protest,” Halsema added. “But also remember that prostitution is now also located in an area where people live relatively safely and pleasantly. Everyone has things that we would rather not see in our backyard. But in general Amsterdammers are tolerant.”Last year an audit of a previous 10-year project to clean up the red-light district, involving the closure of 100 brothel windows and extra checks on owners, had failed to reduce human trafficking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37766ffd101f434001206830192e7a4f60fab9e5/0_306_4598_2759/master/4598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3c16398b42477fcf827390d0926d059","title":"brexit just one eu headache angela merkel avoids rocking boat","story":"As another five-year term begins, the bloc is straining for unity across a range of issuesWhen the German chancellor was asked this week why she would not railroad Italy and the so-called Visegrád group of countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary – into accepting the former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, a critic of populist governments, as European commission president, Angela Merkel’s answer was telling.“The Brexit is looming on the horizon,” Merkel said in reference to the need to avoid tensions when appointing the next head of the commission. “Other important issues are on the table. I think we need to treat each other with care.”For all the unity it has shown so far in its negotiations with the UK, the EU is straining to keep its many different constituencies onside across a range of other issues. The next five-year term offers more of the same.The ergence in values that threatens to cripple the bloc was neatly highlighted at a summit this month when Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a communique that committed to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 – a target that was already seen as too wishy-washy by green lobby groups, given the gravity of the climate emergency.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C at a September summit. He had written to Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, asking the EU to show leadership on the world stage – and it could not.The three naysayers are seeking extra recompense for making green changes to their economies in the upcoming seven-year budget known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF), but they will face stern challenge from members, such as the Netherlands, which are firmly opposed to the EU being a “transfer union”.Indeed the negotiations over the MFF, optimistically scheduled to have finished in May, are predictably proving to be a major headache, leading the EU budget commissioner, Günther Oettinger, to recently warn: “It’s not really five minutes to midnight, it’s almost five past midnight already.”The package asks net recipients such as France and Germany to pay more as a trade-off for less being handed over in cohesion funds to the central and eastern European states, and more being invested in scientific research and development. But failure to find agreement by the end of October could lead to the EU being unable to fund the next round of Horizon Europe research and development programmes.The difficulties in the talks are understandable. The ergence in values is matched by an economic ergence from east to west and north to south that the EU has failed to bridge, despite the almost existential threat it posed during the eurozone crisis, when economies unable to borrow on the market had to come cap in hand to Berlin, only to be put on a humiliating diet of cuts as the price for help.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has championed a eurozone budget, to allow the EU to act as a sovereign nation in times of trouble, but there has only yet been agreement on a tiny symbolic pot. No wonder, then, that the populist Italian government has raged at Brussels meddling in its tax and spend plans, which it says is necessary to boost its struggling economy.But as the new leaders in Brussels – Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde as the first female presidents of the European commission and European Central Bank respectively, and Charles Michel as European council president – move into their offices this autumn, it will be Brexit that will be sucking up their time and energy.It is certain that the next British prime minister, likely to be Boris Johnson, will not secure the increasingly outlandish potential concessions being touted by the two candidates in the Tory leadership race.The battle might then be to deal with the economic costs of a no-deal Brexit and a toxic relationship with London at a time when Donald Trump’s White House piles on the pressure through tariffs on trade and China doubles down in its investments in Africa, leaving the EU trailing behind in emerging markets there. Merkel’s commitment to avoiding a row over personnel suddenly becomes more understandable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c837cb398b0d279f5d3cc4127644a531e585da58/0_189_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c24bd7ccca1ed193f522b873e4e4497","title":"canada metis nations indigenous agreement","story":"Three agreements laid groundwork for possible future land claims, reparations and centuries-long grievances for Métis nationsGrowing up as member of Alberta’s Métis community, Audrey Poitras was always acutely aware of the unique struggle her people faced.The Métis are one of Canada’s Indigenous peoples, with roots 400 years deep. But although these mixed-race people were descended from Canada’s original inhabitants and French fur traders, they were excluded from negotiations between the federal government and other Indigenous peoples. For more than a century, they had no land and no formal status.Now president of the Métis Nation of Alberta, Poitras echoes the words of generations of previous leaders: “We’re not asking for any special treatment. We’re just saying, recognize us for who we are – as one of the Indigenous peoples of this country.”Last week, Poitras was one of the signatories of a landmark agreement with Canada that gave the Métis nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario the power of self-government. “It’s emotional, and it’s recognizing that all the work that our people did before is now coming to fruition,” she says.The three agreements signed on Thursday lay the groundwork for possible future land claims, reparations and other settling of centuries-long grievances. At the emotional signing ceremony, Canada’s crown-Indigenous relations minister, Carolyn Bennett, said the government was committed to advancing the self-determination of the Métis.“It is truly an historic moment,” says Margaret Froh, president of the Métis nation of Ontario.Self-government enables Indigenous people in Canada to create their own constitution, as well as their own regulations on land, resources, business, culture, housing, healthcare, education and other elements that previously fell under the responsibility of federal or provincial governments.For the Métis nation of Ontario, Froh is focused on taking the momentum and running with it. “We really have to roll up our sleeves and get down to the work of implementing the agreement,” says Froh.Today, there are nearly 600,000 Métis living primarily in Ontario and the Canadian west, forming nearly a third of the country’s Indigenous population. Unlike many First Nations, Métis don’t typically live on reserves but like other Indigenous Canadians, many still face poverty, unemployment and health problems. A lack of official status has made it difficult to address these issues in any structured way.“For Métis in Canada, our story has never really been told,” says Froh. “There’s been a name associated with the Métis: ‘the Forgotten People’.”Canada’s Indian Act, a law first passed in 1876 and which is still in effect today, created the reserve system and gave specific rights and land access to Indigeous peoples – but not Métis or Inuit.In western provinces, a 19th-century scrip system dissolved Métis land titles and replaced them with a voucher Métis could exchange for land or money. Many vouchers were not honoured.The new agreements come after a protracted battle that has seen armed resistances, the birth of a province and the death by hanging of the Métis leader Louis Riel, who led two rebellions against the Canadian government. He was exiled after the first and executed for high treason after the second, in 1885. What followed was more than a century of strife for Métis people throughout the country.Although their treaty rights were formally recognized in Canada’s 1982 Constitution Act, the Métis have long been what Froh calls a “political football” lobbed between provinces and the federal government.“Canada has finally come to the decision – the same decision we have — about, ‘Why do we always have to go to courts to sort this out? Why don’t we sit down and negotiate?’” says Poitras. “And we have a negotiating table to do that now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e783352e8888d837189c91ac2b31f2ea8cea43/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78fb488b1b3dd2f9641863889cffef37","title":"royal marines gibraltar tanker oil syria eu sanctions","story":"Tanker was thought to be going to Banyas refinery, in breach of EU sanctions against SyriaA detachment of nearly 30 Royal Marines and Gibraltarian police have seized a supertanker suspected of carrying Iranian oil to Syria in what the UK said was a breach of European Union sanctions against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.The British Foreign Office praised “firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities” in intercepting the vessel, called Grace 1, although Spain said Gibraltar had acted in response to a request made first by the US to the UK.Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister, thanked the efforts of the “brave men and women” from the Royal Marines and the local agencies involved in the operation, and confirmed that the Grace 1 had been detained.The chief minister added: “This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, the Grace 1, was acting in breach of EU sanctions against Syria.“In fact we have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas refinery in Syria.”Just under 30 Royal Marines from 42 Commando were involved in the overnight seizure, with some landing on the ship’s deck with the help of a Wildcat helicopter and the rest arriving via a speedboat.UK Ministry of Defence sources said that British troops were at all times acting under civil authority, the direction of the Gibraltar police. The marines provided the technical expertise to allow the vessel to be boarded at sea.Spain’s acting foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said Gibraltar had acted following a request from the US to Britain. Borrell added that his country was looking into the seizure and how it may affect Spanish sovereignty. Spain does not recognise the waters around Gibraltar as British.Grace 1 was travelling east through the straits of Gibraltar. Tracking data from Lloyds List showed that it had started its voyage in Iran, travelling around Africa, before it passed through Gibraltarian territorial waters. Analysts believe it is carrying just over 2m barrels of Iranian crude oil.Mapping data showed it sailed a longer route to the mouth of the Mediterranean, around the southern tip of Africa instead of via Egypt’s Suez Canal.Lloyds List, a specialist shipping website, reported that Grace 1 had “a complex ownership chain” and was controlled by Russian Titan Shipping, a subsidiary of Dubai-based shipping company TNC Gulf. Executives connected with both companies hold Iranian university and technical qualifications, or list their names in Farsi.The EU has imposed a series of economic sanctions against Assad’s regime in Syria in response to the country’s civil war. The UK Foreign Office said: “We welcome this firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities, acting to enforce the EU Syria sanctions regime.”But the action also comes amid a period of heightened tension between the US and Iran as the nuclear agreement aimed at halting Iran’s development of nuclear weapons unravels.Iran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz, a policy of brinkmanship that analysts say is designed to show the US there is an economic cost to the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal and impose economic sanctions.Picardo said: “I want to thank the brave men and women of the Royal Marines, the Royal Gibraltar police, HM Customs Gibraltar and the Gibraltar port authority for their work in securing the detention of this vessel and its cargo. Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international rules-based legal order.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ed2a388c956fcbacbe270afa7d399013fc33c7/596_122_3517_2110/master/3517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d14c11352e4b79dc56727022fa1dc1","title":"lifting the lid on japans poo museum in pictures","story":"Japan’s culture of cute has embraced poo, which gets a pop twist at the Unko Museum in Yokohama, near Tokyo.

She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.Amy Richards cannot remember sitting her first English Leaving Cert exam on June 5th. She had undergone surgery after her appendix ruptured and became gangrenous just hours earlier.The 18-year-old slept for three hours following the surgery at Wexford General Hospital before her mother, at Amy’s request, woke her at 7.30am so she could cram before the exam.At 9.30am she sat down at one of the hospital dinner tables, picked up her pencil and started writing.“I have no idea what I wrote, I don’t know if it was complete gibberish,” she said. “During English paper 2 and maths paper 1 the nausea was horrific. The exams were interrupted on numerous occasions so I could receive pain medication and have my drip changed.“I was trying to write but all I could think about was getting sick. I had to end both exams early and ended up on the bathroom floor getting sick.”Amy first visited the doctor with pain in her abdomen about a week before the State exams began. She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.A few days later she was back with a GP, who immediately sent her to a hospital emergency department.“I don’t think I’ve cried so much in my life as I did that Tuesday. I was frustrated to be missing so much time for studying and when the doctor told me I had to go to hospital I had a panic attack and couldn’t breathe,” Amy says.“When I was told at 7pm that I had appendicitis I didn’t care, I just wanted to sit the exam. I was devastated, English was one of my strongest subjects and I needed it to get the high points for medicine.”Request refusedWhen the severity of their daughter’s condition became clear, her parents contacted her school and the State Examinations Commission asking whether she could reschedule and sit the exams in July with pupils who suffer a bereavement during the Leaving Cert. Their request was refused.Having sat the HPAT, an aptitude test for medicine applicants, earlier in the year and being determined to secure the high points needed to study medicine, Amy insisted on sitting the first three exams in hospital.After being discharged, she sat the remaining exams in a private room in her school during which time she remained on heavy medication including a strong painkiller and anti-nausea medicine.“At the end of the exams I had no sense of achievement. I don’t think people understand how wrong it is to force a child to sit the most important exam of their life when they’re extremely ill,” she said. “The surgeon had told my Mum I was lucky to be alive. If someone’s life is threatened they’re not fit to sit an exam.”Amy has resigned herself to the reality that she may not have done as well as she hoped in the exams. She is looking into medical courses abroad and if she secures enough points, may study science at an Irish university. She is also considering repeating sixth year, but would have to learn an entirely new two-year syllabus for English and music.A Department of Education spokesman said a new pilot scheme had been introduced to allow Leaving Cert students who suffer a close family bereavement during the exams to sit alternative papers in July.Any extension of this would need to take into account the difficult life circumstances some students encounter during exam time, but also the need to be fair to the majority of students sitting exams and “to maintain the integrity of the examinations process”, he said.A spokeswoman for the State Examinations Commission said it was scheduled to undertake a “comprehensive review” of how best to support students experiencing “all forms of trauma and adversity” at exam time.She added that “every possible effort” was already made to accommodate students who experience accidents, illness or other trauma either immediately before or during examinations."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"13 deaths of children in care or known to Tusla were referred to NRP last yearFrances Winston said she fell after being instructed to take step backMichael D Higgins on visit to Leipzig says challenges have brought Europe to the brink of changeSt Francis club mates are expected to form a guard of honour for their beloved \u0026lsquochamp\u0026rsquoSimone Burns was targeted by trolls after video of her abusing Air India crew went viral\u0026lsquoThe drivers of most vehicles showed little respect for cycling\u0026rsquoPay Commission to say it was constrained by terms of reference when making recommendationsBones not being treated as suspicious, garda\u0026iacute sayDIAS, Festival of Curiosity and Birr Castle to celebrate moon landing with series of eventsPolitics digest: Boris Johnson \u0026ndash a modern day Sir Roderick Spode, leader of the black shortsCabinet expected to approve proposals for \u0026euro10.1m package of increases in salaries and allowancesMercosur promises to shut out farms, regions or countries dumping low-quality meatReport to highlight challenges in retaining military pilots, propose allowance increasesKildare County Council called on to change plans for development near motorwayRomanian criminal gang under investigation using fake passports to open bank accountsParties continue efforts as minister says Westminster may reform North\u0026rsquos abortion law"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946434.1562233108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces members set to see immediate rise in take home pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDefence Forces on a UN interim force in Lebanon. Photograph: Defence Forces Press OfficeMembers of the Defence Forces are set to see their take-home earnings rise immediately on Thursday as the Cabinet is expected to approve proposals for a €10.1 million package of increases in allowances.Military service allowances, which currently range from €42 to €123 per week, are expected to be raised by 10 per cent, as part of a move to improve recruitment and retention of personnel. Cuts imposed in 2013 are also expected to be reversed as part of the package. In addition, a loyalty bonus - which could be up to €20,000 - is expected to be put in place to encourage pilots to remain in the Defence Forces.The Government is also expected to announce a series of non-pay initiatives for the Defence Forces, including an action plan to cover areas such as career development, workforce planning and familywork balance measures.A review of pay for up to 2,500 members of the Defence Forces with specialist or technical skills is expected to be recommended. Among those likely to be encompassed by such a review would be cooks, mechanics, technicians, fitters, carpenters, aircraft mechanics, military police investigators and air-traffic controllers.Sources said military organisations may be permitted to hold talks with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regarding some form of partial affiliation with the trade union movement. However, sources said the Government would not grant Defence Forces members the right to go on strike. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe is expected to tell the Cabinet that the cost of increasing the military service allowance by 10 per cent would be approximately €4.8 million in a full year.The proposals, which are to be presented to Cabinet by Mr Donohoe, are based on a report drawn up by the Public Service Pay Commission. If approved by Government, as expected, the new increased allowances would come into effect immediately. The commission’s report will likely be published by Mr Donohoe and Minister of State at the Department of Defence Paul Keogh later on Thursday. The pay proposals were due to be announced earlier this week, but the Tuesday Cabinet meeting was rescheduled as the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attended the extended EU summit in Brussels.Numbers in the Defence Forces have continued to fall despite recent recruitment campaigns. The full strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps combined should be a minimum of 9,500 personnel, but has now fallen below 8,500. This is the lowest point since numbers increased in the 1970s in response to the Troubles. There have been concerns in Government over recent weeks that its planned package for the Defence Forces would not meet the expectations of those campaigning for improved pay and conditions.Following the publication of its plans, the Government is likely to wait to see whether the military representative bodies decide to put the new proposals to a ballot of members. Sources said Wednesday night the organisation representing enlisted personnel, Pdforra, would read the proposals and decide on whether to put the measures to a ballot.The Public Service Pay Commission report is expected to say it was constrained by its terms of reference from making recommendations on increasing core pay for Defence Forces personnel. It will instead propose increases in allowances for Defence Force personnel and urge that other reviews of remuneration for those in technical and specialist areas take place.Retention difficultiesThe commission will say the Defence Forces are facing a unique challenge in retaining pilots, with official projections suggesting the numbers in place may be close to 30 per cent lower than the approved levels this year. It will urge the re-introduction of a loyalty bonus scheme which could be worth nearly €20,000 to pilots.The report is also likely to highlight difficulties in retaining other key specialist personnel such as military aircraft maintenance technicians, air traffic controllers , engineering and ordnance officers in the Army and engineers in the Naval Service.The commission is also expected to say it has evidence of retention difficulties at captain and certain non-commissioned officer levels and that some system of incentivising such personnel to remain in place should be looked at as a priority in future pay negotiations.The report is due to propose that a pay review be undertaken for personnel in technical pay grades and to suggest that there should be significant reforms to the way personnel are recruited.It is likely to argue the Government should consider extending the permitted age for new entrants and re-enlisting or re-commissioning retired staff to assist in the training of new personnel. This would allow serving personnel to concentrate on operational duties. The report is also expected to call on the Government to put in place a series of non-pay measures to try to assist in the retention of military personnel.The commission will say it was prevented by its terms of reference from undertaking a general review on behalf of any group. The report will say the pay structures of the Defence Forces should be examined in the future as part of a general review - which the commission had previously proposed in a report last year - of the adequacy of pay arrangements in the public service.It will urge that the military service allowance be increased by 10 per cent with a minimum increase of €350 per year applicable to those on lower rates of the allowance.The report will also recommend that as a result of the absence of overtime or limits on working hours in the Defence Forces, cuts made to a number of other allowances in 2013 such as the security duty allowance and the patrol duty allowance for naval personnel should be reversed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946538.1562237976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"priests have feelings as well as votes cleric responds to d%C3%A1il sinning priest comment","story":"In a testy exchange in the Dáil the Taoiseach has compared Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin to a priest committing sin after preaching not to commit sin.

Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy During tetchy exchanges on questions about the cost of capital projects in the Dáil on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said: “I am always amused and bemused that Deputy Martin likes to accuse me of being partisan and personal yet as is evidenced by his name-calling today, he is very capable of being partisan and personalised himself.“He kind of reminds me of one of those parish priests who preaches from the altar telling us how to avoid sin while secretly going behind the altar and engaging in any amount of sin himself.”Fr Brendan Hoban said priests, along with their parishioners and friends have feelings and votes, and that “an apology might be advised.” Speaking to The  he wondered if Mr Varadkar would have said such a thing about a Church of Ireland minister. The bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Alphonsus Cullinan , described the Taoiseach’s comments as “very hurtful.”Bishop Cullinan said the comment was unfortunate and it was ironic that it should come the day before a structured dialogue meeting, involving Mr Varadkar, Government members and representatives of the churches of other faiths and of non-confessional bodies, takes place at Dublin Castle.“Now we have one particular religion being singled out for crass treatment.”He said he was standing up for priests around the country. “I am saying well done, you’re doing a great job, keep going.”It was not balanced treatment, he said. When asked if the Taoiseach should apologise for the comment, Bishop Cullinan said it was up to Mr Varadakar to clarify.The situation was very unfortunate and he hoped it would not be repeated. Bringing in the church “out of the blue” when speaking about the Fianna Fáil leader, was “unprovoked.”“I don’t know why he did that.”He urged priests not to be upset by the comment as “the majority of people love their priests.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946540.1562235407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what are the main points of the defence forces allowance raise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Defence Forces are set to see their take-home earnings rise immediately.

Photograph: Peter Endig  dpa  AFPPresident Michael D Higgins has forecast that growing economic, political and climate challenges have brought Europe to the brink of change similar to the epochal changes of 30 years ago.At a keynote address in Leipzig, on the second day of his State visit to Germany, he called for a erse “European conversation” to drag debate over Europe’s future out of EU backrooms and back onto the “European street”.Mr Higgins said it was urgent that Europeans reflect on what Europe means to them: a geographical area, a trade bloc or something more.“How often ... are we speaking of a social Europe? What set of shared values and ethics do we as Europeans aspire to uphold, defend, build upon and promote?” he asked.He was speaking on the second day of his state visit to Germany in the University of Leipzig’s Paulinum hall, built on the foundations of the university church destroyed by East German authorities in 1968.Recalling his happy years as an academic, and two previous visits to Leipzig, Mr Higgins told students and professors that “ideas matter”. Neglecting the breadth and ersity of Europe’s intellectual, political and economic traditions were, he warned, aggravating public disillusionment with social elites. Previous neglect of erse opinions, combined with economic shocks and social turmoils, saw Europeans embrace, a century ago, the “insidious dangers of narrow nationalist movements”.European prosperity dating back to the industrial revolution was, he said, based on an assumption of unlimited growth and drew disproportionately on other’s resources, with a far-reaching ecological consequences now visible.Failing to redefine sovereignty and challenge “insatiable, unregulated accumulation” would, he said, trap Europe in a dead-end, post-industrial revolution “technocracy”.“There can be a Europe beyond coal and steel,” he said, “a green Europe (that) continues to provide for its peoples without damaging irrevocably the fine ecological balance of the planet.”Pushing decarbonisation would require effort to ensure a “just transition” for those in affected industries.Effort, too, would be required to defend from populist nationalism the two-way migration that has always been a part of Europe’s identity. Already French “yellow vest” protests, the election of US president Donald Trump and Brexit were, he said, had raised red flags.Further danger lay ahead if Europe ignores the losers of globalisation and clings to a technocratic, austerity-centric approach to society, he said, rather than tackling “speculative flows of insatiable capital”.He praised German philosopher Jürgen Habermas, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, for urging Europe be taken out of the hands of a “neoliberal orthodoxy” and returned to the people in democratic, reformed EU institutions.Mr Higgins cited the EU’s adopted anthem “Ode to Joy”, written by Friedrich Schiller in Leipzig and set to music by Ludwig van Beethoven, as expressing “the essence of European values which we must continue to strive to fulfil”.The words of the EU’s own anthem, he said, maps a path of solidarity to lead Europe out of its “ever-more rancorous rhetoric”.His speech was greeted with sustained, minute-long applause by the audience in Saxony, where the anti-migration, euroskeptic and far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has surged ahead in polls ahead of an autumn state election.University of Leipzig rector Beate Schücking thanked the president for an “inspiring lecture” and for the Government’s funding of Irish language teaching at the university.Listening in were dozens of language students who learn Irish at the university.“Most of us took it on for fun but now we all see the importance of supporting minority languages,” said 22 year-old Sophia Wilms. “We would love more contact and exchange with people in Ireland who speak the language.”In the late 19th century Leipzig became a spiritual home of Irish and Celtic studies in continental Europe thanks to local professor Ernst Windisch.Mr Higgins inspected manuscripts of Windisch’s Irish grammar, and his translation of Táin Bó Cúalnge. A century ago this year, the influential German celtologist Kuno Meyer died in Leipzig.But Celtic studies and Irish language teaching are on the retreat across Germany, with the last professorial chair given up in Berlin 20 years ago.Other minority languages fare better in Leipzig, say local academics: Catalonia funds a chair here while Galician and Basque regions also finance studies of their languages and culture.Leipzig lecturers said they would welcome greater funding - even a professorial chair of Irish - to complement Ireland’s new push for a wider and deeper exchange and understanding with Germany.“Any slightly higher financial support from Ireland might restore institutionalised Celtic- Irish studies here,” said Prof Sabine Asmus. After his lecture, Mr Higgins visited the 850 year-old Nikolaikirche, the Church of St Nicholas, home to premieres of key works by local music director Johann Sebastian Bach.In 1989 Leipzig was the starting point of Germany’s peaceful revolution and the church its focus. An eye witness from that time - echoing Mr Higgins’s earlier lecture - recalled how social and climate concerns forced the slow - then fast - collapse of East Germany 30 years ago.“We brought traffic to a standstill,” said Mr Frank Pörner. “25,000 people came voluntarily, without any organised invitation and today I cannot imagine that a demonstration of this size remained non-violent.”At a lunch in Leipzig town hall, Mr Higgins met mayor Burkhard Jung and Saxon state premier Michael Kretschmer. “We in Saxony are concerned about what is happening in Anglo-Saxony,” said Mr Kretschmer, a leading figure in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “We have understood very well what bothers the Irish and we all have a great interest that the European Commission gets to work soon so that the great challenges before us can be solved.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

found nearly half local authority run primary schools","story":"The Health and Safety Executive say asbestos only presents a risk if it is disturbed or damagedAsbestos is found in nearly half of local authority run primary schools, new figures show, leaving children at increased risk of developing cancer.There are 5,196 state maintained primaries that contain asbestos out of a total of 11,217 in England, according to figures obtained under freedom of information requests.    Even low levels of exposure to asbestos fibres can cause both lung cancer, as well as cancer of the lining of the lung called mesothelioma.Most victims die within 18 months of diagnosis, but it often does not appear until around 40 years after the person first breathes in the dust.The lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma is predicted to be about three and a half times greater for a child first exposed at age five compared to an adult first exposed at age 25 and about five times greater when compared to an adult first exposed at age 30, according to advice provided to the Government.Kate Sweeney, a partner in personal injury at the law firm Stephensons Solicitors LLP, said that the primary school data is only the “tip of the ice berg” since local authorities do not hold information about academies and free schools, which are now the majority of schools in England.Three quarters of schools contain asbestos, but the Health and Safety Executive say that it only presents a risk if it is disturbed or damaged, which risks fibres being released into the atmosphere. According to the National Union of Teachers, 319 teachers have died from mesothelioma since 1980. It is estimated that for every teacher’s death, nine children will die, meaning over 100 people will die every year in the UK as a result of exposure when they were at school. There is no statutory duty on schools to report their asbestos management, Ms Sweeney said, which means many turn a blind eye to the potential danger it poses.  “Primary schools contain children who are boisterous,” she told The Daily . “If you don’t know where the asbestos is, how can you ever ensure they aren’t disturbed?  “The simple act of putting a pin into a wall to put a display up can puncture the wall and that might release fibres – teachers at the very least should know where the asbestos is.”  A Government report published in 2017 found that asbestos in schools is a “serious” problem which could threaten the health of children, as it concluded that thousands of schools are failing to follow safety guidelines. Liz Darlison, from Mesothelioma UK, the national charity for asbestos-related cancer, said that because developing the disease can take several decades following exposure, the dangers of asbestos are “perhaps not fully appreciated”.  She said: “Many people still think that asbestos is a problem of the past and that asbestos-related illnesses only occur in trades’ people or people who have worked in the construction industry.“This is simply not the case. The potentially deadly material has been used in all types of buildings and is still present in many primary schools due to aging school buildings.”A Department for Education spokesman said it plans to publish the findings of its Asbestos Management Assurance Process school survey shortly.  “Since 2015, we have already allocated more than £7.4 billion to those responsible for school buildings to maintain and improve the school estate, including removing asbestos when it is the safest course of action, the spokesman added. Tory leadership latest: Jeremy Hunt faces backlash from Tory MPs over

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course. AndI had to pick only one, it would be Tommy claiming Molly-Mae “refreshies me,”you really ­pushied me.The inescapable feeling, watching this series of Love Island, however, is that all the innocence and quite a lot of the charm has been lost forever, like, literally.Joe and Lucie — Jucie.Jordan and Anna — Jordanna.Anton and Belle — Bellend.FOLLOWING the main BBC News, from Glastonbury, and The One Show, from Glastonbury, there was a complete change of gear from the Beeb from .pm on Friday.Glastonbury, on every single BBC channel, with the usual cast of thousands playing presenter tag.So a gushing Clara Amfo threw to Mark Radclfe and Jo Whiley, who threw to Jack Saunders, at the John Peel stage, who threw to James Ballardie, who threw back to Jo Whiley and some new bloke called Huw Stephens, who threw . . .You get the point. There were busloads of them.Yet, with the honourable exception of Mark Radclfe, who’s a great broadcaster, the usual rules of presenting were suspended at Glastonbury.None of them were presentable, for a start.Genuine laughs were non-existent and nearly all critical faculties had been left at home, so they couldn’t even point out “s children’s TV presenter” wasn’t a good look for Tim Burgess, of The Charlatans, let alone hint that maybe Stormzy hadn’t had enough big hits to headline the Pyramid Stage.You’d imagine, then, that they all brought a breadth of knowledge and inside information that would illuminate the valley like , cigarette lighters being flipped on for a final encore.Jo Whiley: “Do you have any idea who might be coming out on stage with Stormzy ”Huw Stephens: “I have no idea.”But you’d imagine wrong.MEANWHILE, on recent episodes of ­EastEnders, the emaciated remains of Louise Mitchell have been found inside a shipping ­container that washed up in the Crimea, Keanu’s died after being tied to a chair and shoved off a tall building by Sharon, and new love interest Adrian Edmonson reacted to being doused in water by battering Jean Slater ­repeatedly round the head with a ­rubber frying pan and jabbing a fork into her ­buttocks.Not in broadcast episodes, obviously. Just the make-believe version I’ve got playing in my own head.Glastonbury, Jo Whiley: “Stormzy seems like the nicest guy on Earth.”Love Island, Molly-Mae: “I’m not a stereotypical social media girl.”And Drag SOS: “The Family Fabulous are travelling the country to give Britain a much needed lt.”Or yet another little needed ar*e-ache, depending on your point of view.JUST when you thought television had run out of jobs, holidays, pointless endeavours and ar*e-end-of-the-world places for Z-listers to visit, along comes this next game of Monkey Tennis.Trawlermen: Celebs At Sea, with Shane Lynch, from Boyzone, chef Antony Worrall Thompson and former England rugby player Ben Cohen, who spent ten days bobbing around the North Atlantic and throwing their guts up for the benefit of Channel  viewers.Before they reached that happy pass, though, the three of them were warned, in no uncertain terms, that one unlucky trawlerman had recently “lost his testicles after getting them tangled”.Something which, you’d think, wouldn’t hold any new horror for Ben Cohen after having to tell his we Abby what he’d been up to with the Russian dancer from Strictly.Two days into their adventure, however, he was confronted by something just as terrying, which had his voice trailing off, down in the gutting room.“I remember this monkfish coming towards me with its mouth open and teeth everywhere.“And it was a big mouth as well and I just thought . . .”Kristina  What the hell are you doing here Picture research: Marta Breese.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Who’s the only one of the Queen’s children not to have a daughter ”Vivienne: “Prince Philip.”Bradley Walsh: “What nickname for golfer Frank Urban Zoeller is derived from his initials ”Richard: “Tiger.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which item of swimming gear is named from an atoll in the Pacic Ocean ”Andy: “Speedo.”And Bradley Walsh: “The Attenborosaurus dinosaur is named in honour of which TV naturalist ”Hannah: “Pass.”Casey Stoney: “Crucially it means Nigeria have only had  hours to prepare. But that won’t make any dference.”Alex Scott: “Japan have to remain positive.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it was all a stunt for the papers.Sarah was a nanny and looked after the children of wealthy couples. Often she would work odd hours and stay overnight caring for the children so Id take in parcels for her.Sarah has vowed she will never settle for having just one partner again — and has instead ed head first into the kinky world of sex fetish parties.She has now sworn off monogamy – after her marriage to the man she wed on their first date ended in under two months.Sarah, who is now dating TWO toyboys, matched with husband Paul Edwards on dating app Bumble in December .Ten days later they met for the first time at Gatwick Airport and flew to Las Vegas to get hitched over Christmas.But it’s not all doom and gloom for Sarah. She says: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.“I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all.“Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it.“My rainbow hair is the embodiment of the new me — strong, confident and ready for whatever the weather.”The couple’s split did not come as a surprise to Sarah’s family and friends, who always thought she was “bonkers” for marrying someone she had never met before.And Sarah confessed it was not exactly lust at first sight.She says: “I wasn’t initially attracted to Paul. But he seemed laid-back and nice and I was swept away in the moment.”The pair celebrated their honeymoon by buying each other private lap dances at a strip club.Sarah, who loves being a dominatrix, thought she had finally met someone who could keep up with her high sex drive.“It was great,” she recalls. “I love kinky parties and role playing and although Paul was not au fait with that world, he was open to it.“I thought I’d met my match, in and out of the bedroom.”Once back in the UK, Paul, , who was training to be an electrician, moved from Chichester, West Sussex, into Sarah’s home in Crowborough, East Sussex, which she shared with her two exes — also called Paul.Sarah says: “At first all three Pauls got on well. We were one big, happy, albeit unusual, family.“But my husband was very jealous of one of my Pauls, who I’d had a long-term relationship with and who shared the mortgage.”A week after husband Paul moved in, Sarah claims he started a row with her and her two Pauls.She says: “Everyone was getting on well. We were playing a board game and chilling out together at home.“But Paul got funny because I was apparently sitting two inches closer to my ex on the sofa.“He accused me of still being in love with him.“After that night the atmosphere turned sour and both ex Pauls started to hide in their rooms. It should have been a huge red flag.”“I understood my Paul’s fears as it was a weird set-up.“I’d sometimes be with my ex in his room, comforting him, but leaving the door open to appease my husband.“But Paul would storm in and accuse me of sleeping with Paul.”In an attempt to get their relationship back on track, Sarah says, the couple got dressed up in kinky gear for a night out at sex fetish party Torture Garden.Unsurprisingly, it did not do the trick. Sarah says: “Paul was a fish out of water.“Guys were coming up to me just to say ‘Hi’ and he would get all jealous and put his arm around me asto say, ‘She’s mine’.“Shortly after, we went to a gay night at a club in Brighton.“I was chatting to a gay couple at the bar. They were being flirty, flamboyant and fabulous and pushed a lollipop in my face and said, ‘Do you want a suck babe ’.“Jokingly, I obliged then gave one a cheeky kiss on the lips. Paul went absolutely mental and said I’d cheated on him.“He followed me around the whole night and watched me like a hawk.“I felt conned, like he had sold me a version of himself that wasn’t real.“As I became less attracted to him, our sex le dwindled.“He also got a man cold and was moaning all the time. It wasn’t sexy at all.”In February, Sarah says she asked Paul to move out as the rows were getting her down.But determined to prove the doubters wrong, Sarah decided to try to give their relationship another go. She says: “I knew people would say, ‘I told you so’, which was hard to swallow.“We were married and I took those vows seriously. I still wanted to make it work.”Later that month, they met for a romantic dinner. A few days after, Sarah says Paul invited her to a swingers’ night at club Le Boudoir in central London.She continues: “We were having a good night and were both chatting to a couple.“Paul fancied the girl and the pair started kissing. It didn’t bother me as, you know, we were in a swinging club, and I kissed her too.“But then her boyfriend stuck his hand up my skirt and grabbed me and I thought, ‘This is not cool’.“So I left the circle and went to get a drink.“Paul was annoyed as I’d ruined his chances with the girl and started another big row.”After a failed attempt at couples’ counselling, the pair split for good — days before their two-month anniversary.And as Paul left Sarah’s flat for the final time, he took one of Sarah’s Pauls with him.“That really upset me,” recalls Sarah. “He got that Paul to move in somewhere . It wasn’t the ex he was really jealous of, it was my other ex, whom I dated for a while.“It was really tough. I’d lost one of my jobs as a nanny and now I was going to lose the £ a month rent from that Paul.”It was then that Sarah says she decided to REALLY throw herself into the kink and sex fetish community.She says: “I became obsessed. I started going to a dferent BDSM event every week.“I lost all my mates when I married Paul, so now all my new friends are at these events.”In May she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and matched with a -year-old toyboy who works in the City of London.“He told me he was polyamorous,” she says. “We got on so well and his unconventional lestyle made sense.“He sees other women and I have recently met another -year-old guy who works in IT. It’s amazing, we all go to kink events together.“I dress them up in whatever outfits I want and I am their dom.“I dressed one up as a ballet dancer the other day.“They don’t get jealous of each other and we always ask permission first before getting with someone .“After feeling trapped in a jealous marriage it has really put me off being with one man again.”Laughing, she adds: “I’d love three boyfriends. It’s a good number.“I’ve got another date next week and I am very excited about it.” She says: “Despite everything, I don’t regret my relationship with Paul because I have learnt so much about myself and I’m much stronger and confident now.“But I am never dating another Paul again . . . it’s a rubbish name anyway.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games.

Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop.

No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean, I got cut by machines, I got run over by a car, Ive never seen pain like this.The lawyer told the news channel: “He wasn’t smoking at the time, he was working, and it literally just exploded in his pants.“There was this flash and then he was on fire.”The attorney said his client was able to douse the flames and get himself treated at Health burn unit in Cleveland.He had suffered second and third degree burns, and the burn on his thigh was described as “the size of a volleyball.”And the lawyer added: “Like a lot of people, he was trying to be healthier by not smoking tobacco and thinking this is safer, and winds up getting pretty seriously burned.”Merriman, of Landskroner Grieco Merriman, said Naders situation was unique because the battery exploded while it was sitting in his pocket, rather than while being used like in other previously unfortunate instances.Vaping is the process of smoking e-cigarettes, allowing a person to inhale nicotine without other harmful substances in tobacco.The term is used as e-cigarettes do not produce smoke - instead releasing a vapour.The vapour is produced from a material such as an e-liquid.Millions of Brits now get their nicotine hit via e-cigarettes, and they are continuing to grow in popularity.A study in August  has suggested vaping is more harmful than first thought.Researchers found e-cigs boost the production of inflammatory chemicals in the body.And the vapour kills protective cells in the lung that keep the air spaces clear of harmful bugs.Public Health England said vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking and switching completely from smoking to vaping conveys substantial health benefits.And they said the evidence does not support the concern that e-cigarettes are a route into smoking among young people.They claim e-cigs are  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.And they suggest smokers should consider switching to vaping in a bid to help them quit.Naders lawyer said is now suing battery maker LG Chem, and retailer, Cleveland Vape, under the Ohio Product Liability Law.Merriman pointed out to the lack of regulation in the market.He said: “It just raises a lot of questions about these batteries and how they’re manufactured, how they’re designed.“We believe that this battery is a legitimate, genuine LG Chem-manufactured battery, but there’s a lot of knock-offs that are coming in from China and other third-world countries, and there’s no regulation at all.”Last month, a teenager suffered horror injuries after his e-cigarette exploded in his mouth - and blew out his teeth.The -year-old had to travel  miles with a bloody mouth, broken teeth and a hole in his jaw to get the nearest hospital after the freak accident.Doctors rushed the boy into surgery to reconstruct and repair the shattered bone, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The unnamed boy from Nevada, Utah, had extensive injuries to his mouth, several missing teeth and a broken lower jaw when he got to AE two hours after the explosion.Earlier this year, another vaper died after using an e-cigarette for the first time which then exploded and cut an artery in his neck.William Eric Brown, , had trying out the vaporizer pen which is said to be a safer alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes.The young electrician from Fort Worth, Texas, was taking his first draws from the e-cigarette he had just bought which blew up his face while he was sitting in his car.Shrapnel then penetrated his head and neck, puncturing his left carotid artery through which blood is pumped from the heart to the brain.He died several days after the incident after doctors had struggled to remove a three-inch piece of jagged metal, an inquest found.Sun Online has approached LG Chem and Cleveland Vape for comment.Most vape pens are powered by a lithium-ion battery, and that’s what can trigger the fires and explosions that can occur.When you vape, a battery powers the heating element that then turns the chemical solution in the canister into a vapour.Lithium-ion batteries cause problems when they’re overheated from direct sunlight, short circuits, or overcharging.Vape pens have a USB port that appears to be compatible with any USB cable and charger.People often assume that any charger will do, as long as it fits and the device responds, but that’s not the case, reproted LeHacker."},{"url":null,"title":"boss confiscate mobile stop texting facebook at work","story":"Managers are beginning to feel they can’t trust employees to resist the temptation to message pals and update their social media profiles.It has been common practice for retailers such as Tesco to ban phones but it now seems officer workers are being told to leave their devices in lockers too.Unions have now warned that there is a “new front for friction” between bosses and workers, according to The Times.A marketing company director, based in West Yorkshire, recently admitted not hiring staff who would not hand over their phones.Gerard O’Shaughnessy, , of Business Marketing Services in Cleckheaton, now confiscates people’s phones until lunchtime in a bid to increase productivity.He first took mobiles off his workers two months ago and said people have complained it “breached their human rights”.Mr O’Shaughnessy told the paper: “We’ve had girls have complete meltdowns when they’ve come to work and been told they need to put their phone in a box.“Others have said it’s almost breaching their human rights.

The provocative politician compared the EU to oppressors including as feudal barons and the heads of colonial empires.In an explosive speech the newly-elected Brexit MEP for the south west declared: “Nous allons, wir gehen , weaposre off!Sitting alongside the former Tory Home Secretary a grinning Nigel Farage could be seen egging her on. Ms Widdecombe, who was the first Brexit MEP to speak in the Strasbourg parliament declared: There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on their oppressors, slaves against their owners, the peasantry against the feudal barons, colonies against their empires and that is why Britain is leaving, she said.  It doesn’t matter which language you use, we are going and we are glad to be going, the former Tory MP said.    Her inflammatory language was greeted with anger from the other MEPs but her colleagues from the Brexit party cheered, clapped and banged their desks. Ms Widdecombe slammed the EUaposs method of choosing its leaders. She said: “It’s a great honour to speak on behalf of the largest single party in this place. “And may I say,I needed any convincing at all that the best thing for Britain is to leave here as soon as possible, it was the way those elections were conducted yesterday.  “If that is this placeaposs idea of democracy, that is a serious betrayal of every country that is represented here.”She added: “That is just one of many reasons why Britain is right to be leaving this place, hopefully on Halloween.Ms Widdecombe has a long history of making offensive comments.Lib Dem MEP Martin Horwood said to “imply that the United Kingdom is any way in a similar situation to the colonies of our former empire or a victim of slavery is deeply offensive”. “Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism,” he said. “If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing section . “Ann Widdecombe has not only embarrassed herself, but she has embarrassed the nation she represents. I hope she withdraws her comments and sincerely apologises to all those she has offended immediately.” Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: “It is impossible to explain how offensive and ahistorical it is for you to equate my ancestors tearing off their chains with your small-minded nationalist project. Shame on you.” The veteran campaigner against LGBT rights - caused outrage during the EU election campaign by defending support she gave to gay cure treatments. The former Tory home affairs chief was hauled up on a  article that defended gay conversion therapy, and said the homosexual lobby was stopping people who want to turn straight from doing so. Critics say gay conversion is unethical and people are pressured into it.Theresa May has branded the practice abhorrent and vowed to ban it. But Ms Widdecombe defended her comments and went further, telling Sky News science may yet provide an answer to the question of whether people can switch sexuality. The Atlantic slave trade involved the forced enslavement of many millions of Africans in the US.There were a series of slave revolts in the th Century and a number took on inidual acts of resistance including mothers killing their newborn children to save them from slavery, the poisoning of slave owners, the destruction of machinery and crops and running away.Thousands of runaways were led to freedom in the North and in Canada by black and white abolitionists who organized a network of secret routes and hiding places that came to be known as the Underground Railroad.The Civil War, which ultimately liberated the country’s slaves, began in .

And today minister Will Quince confessed: My understanding is the documentation was not requested.  Mr Quince revealed the DWP is now reviewing its entire safeguarding policy and has carried out  reviews into benefit cases since , many of them suicides. But his confession left MPs furious.    Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “The DWP has failed disabled people again”. She added: Will the government now accede to the widespread calls for an independent inquiry into the way in which assessments are carried out  Will the government commit to an independent review into deaths of ill or disabled people when they may have been linked to DWP activity Mr Quince said the DWP keeps e-mail records for just  months. So eventhe documents were handed over, any evidence that they were will long since have been deleted.Lib Dem welfare chief Christine Jardine said there were only two possibilities - either it was deliberately withheld and covered up, or it was incompetence.Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, who raised todayaposs Urgent Question, also questionedthe documents were deliberately withheld.   If they were unaware of the existence of these documents, how could they request them  she said. It is deeply troubling that the department appears to have had no record of what was supplied to the reviews. She added: A governmentaposs first duty is to protect its people, all its people, but they are failing the sick and disabled. And this reveals the enormity of this failure. Frank Field said in the Hillsborough and tainted blood inquiries the government had to volunteer information - not wait to be asked. The MP, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: [Itaposs] not for the chair of an inquiry to fish for information which would be crucial to the proper consideration of events that lead to someoneaposs death. Since  the DWP has carried out  internal process reviews into inidual benefit cases.  Mr Quince told MPs not all  reviews related to suicides of benefit claimants - but couldnapost say how many did. He added records of these reviews are kept for six years, rather than the  months for other e-mail records. Mr Quince said the DWP is currently reviewing the safeguarding guidance for staff and will report back in Autumn . The scope of the review is considering what more we at the DWP can do to support vulnerable claimants, he announced. With an emphasis on both ensuring safety and working with partners to provide necessary support. The review covers all areas of DWP delivery activities.  He added: We take the death of any disability benefits claimant very seriously indeed. And [we] always conduct an investigation into the circumstances where we are informed the claimant committed suicide. As the review contains extremely personal information, it would not be appropriate to declare which inidual cases were shared with the reviewers on this occasion. But even this vow drew ire because he used the phrase commit suicide. Bridgend MP Madeleine Moon said: No one in the UK commits suicide. People take their own le, but the word commit relates to a crime. Suicide is not a crime in this country and hasn’t been for some time. Mr Quince replied: Language is important and she was right to pull me and others across the House up for the use of that language.

The Foreign Secretary’s unique selling point is he is supposed to be the adult in the race against the unruly adolescent that is Boris Johnson. Yet he keeps trashing his own brand with this pathetic appeals to the Conservative base. In an otherwise decent party conference speech he demeaned himself  by comparing the EU to the former soviet union . Then there has been the cringe inducing flip-flopping on whether he supports a no deal Brexit.In the latest example of self-inflicted humiliation he has used an interview in the   to back the repeal of the hunting ban. While Boris Johnson comes across as an ultra one step away from a letime ban, Hunt is like a fair weather football fan trying to sing along with the chants without knowing the words. His support for fox hunting is unlikely to win over all but a small group of shire Tories and many of them will be unimpressed with such a cynical and synthetic move. The majority of Conservatives, including many of Hunt’s MP supporters, are still scarred by the  general election. During the campaign the Mirror broke the story that Theresa May was in favour of repealing the hunting ban.  The story subsequently spread like wild fire on social media and many Tory MPs believe it was  responsible for them losing a handful of key seats. Huntaposs attempt on the radio this morning to distance himself from his own announcement only further harmed his chances.The Boris Johnson policy blitz continues today  with a ‘promise’ to recruit an additional , police officers. The £.bn a year cost will take his total spending pledges so far to nearly £bn. So far he has promised £bn in income tax cuts, £bn in stamp duty cuts, £bn in national insurance contributions and £.bn on education spending. The magic money tree is being harvested to within an inch of its le. Just as with  Johnson’s review of sin taxes  his record in office is coming back to haunt him. When London Mayor he introduced the same sugar tax he now, for expediency, claims to deplore. His time in City Hall also saw him cut the  number of police officers by , between  and   in addition to closing dozens of police stations.

The Tory leadership hopeful was skewered on the radio today after admitting heaposd want to bring back the bloodsport as PM. Mr Hunt was forced to insist the law is not going to change on fox hunting and it wouldnapost be my priority as Prime Minister. But in a car crash interview, he came unstuck when repeatedly asked by BBC Radio aposs Today programme whether the practice is cruel. Interviewer Mishal Husain told him the RSPCA said the practice involved wild animals being chased to the point of exhaustion, set upon by dogs for sport. Askedthat was cruel, Mr Hunt replied: My view is a matter of public record. But what matters now are the things I want to change as Prime Minister. Asked a second timeit was cruel, Mr Hunt said: My view is a matter of public record.    Asked a third time, he said: Iaposm here to talk about the things I want to change as Prime Minister. That is not something thataposs going to change. Rural broadband is something that urgently needs to be speeded up. Business rates... Exasperated Ms Husain tried a fourth time, saying: Youaposre swerving away from the subject! I asked youyou think that fox hunting is cruel. And for some reason youaposre not willing to sayit is or it isnapost. He replied: I have never hunted and itaposs not my thing but the way I voted is a matter of public record.  Labouraposs Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman said: It is incredible and shocking that Jeremy Hunt, who aspires to be the next Prime Minister, can not bring himself to even acknowledge the barbaric cruelty of fox hunting.Once again it shows this Tory government’s lack of understanding and sincerity on issues of animal welfare. It comes after the Foreign Secretary voiced his support for the sport which has been banned in England in Wales for nearly  years. He said it was part of the countryside’s “heritage”, he would give MPs a free vote on bringing it back, and heaposd personally vote in favour of scrapping the ban.    Mr Huntaposs surprise intervention will trigger dismay among Tory modernisers, who hoped he was the candidate to quell Boris Johnsonaposs lurch to the right. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: Labour proudly banned this barbaric practice. This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse. Mr Hunt stressed he would only seek to bring a free vote to the Commons – where MPs vote according to their consciences –there was a majority in Westminster for such a view. He told Today: There isn’t a majority in the House of Commons and I don’t see there ever being one. But he did back putting a commitment to a free vote in the Tory manesto. Labour MP Angela Rayner said his pledge was absolutely disgusting and a naked bid to win , Tory membersapos votes. She said: The vast majority of the public want this cruel  vile practice consigned to the dustbin of history. Jeremy Hunt thinks it might appeal to a few Tory tally ho types in the shires. We will not go back to this repulsive pastime! Mr Huntaposs vocal display of support for hounds ripping apart foxes risks derailing his No bid. Theresa Mayaposs confession to the Mirror during the snap  general election that she had always backed the rural past-time was widely blamed for fuelling her ballot box humiliation. Polls consistently show around three-quarters or more of Britons are against bringing back the bloodsport. Labour Party Chairman Ian Lavery added: This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse “We’ve had Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy, a race to the bottom on no-deal Brexit , and now a pledge to bring back this barbaric practice that Labour had proudly banned. Animal Equality executive director Toni Vernelli said: “Jeremy Hunt has a very short memory – It was this same pledge that lost Theresa May the youth vote at the last election. “Hunting with dogs is a cruel relic of the past. “Britain has long moved on from finding animal abuse entertaining, and Jeremy Hunt is living in a cavehe hasn’t noticed this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family bullied girl 12 who","story":"NewsFamily of bullied girl, , who drowned in river say her death was not an accidentShukri Yahya Abdis family have rejected the findings of a police investigation after she drowned in the River Irwell in BuryShareCommentsByChris kitchingSenior Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uncle-shukri-abdi-describes-how-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The family of a -year-old refugee schoolgirl who drowned in a river say she was being bullied and they donapost believe her death was an accident.Shukri Yahya Abdiaposs grief-stricken mother, Zamzam Ture, has rejected a police probe which found the young girlaposs death in the River Irwell was not suspicious, and claims her daughter was denied the truth. The family allege Shukri was being bullied by fellow pupils at her school in Bury, Greater Manchester, and they have accused staff of failing to protect her. Responding to claims that the schoolgirl was pushed into the river, Greater Manchester Police spokesman toldthe probe found no truth to the allegations, adding: It doesnapost match with our investigation.Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.   The force has described Shukriaposs death as an incredibly tragic incident and said “there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances at this time. Police have dismissed claims Shukri was pushed into the river which have gone viral on social media. After the Broad Oak Sports College pupil drowned in the river in Bury on June , police issued a warning over the dangers of playing or swimming in open water. But her mum said Shukri didnapost know how to swim and doesnapost believe she was there to swim.  The family doesnapost believe she would go to the river miles from her home with children from her school. Shukri is understood to have been with two other girls when she ended up in the river. Maz Saleem, who has been supporting the family and a campaign for a wider investigation into the death, wrote on Facebook: It is alleged that Shukri was constantly bullied at the school and was led to the river. According to her family she couldnapost swim.In a video posted on social media, Ms Ture said: The police said [to me] your daughter died in an accident, she was playing with other kids, she died there. The other kids were not wet or harmed, so it was a denial.  She was denied the truth. The police havenapost shown us any evidence. I have no proof of what happened. Ms Ture, whose family came to the UK two years ago as refugees from wartorn Somalia, added: The school where my daughter was bullied ...  I had been complaining to forever. The devastated mum claims she had complained to the school many times about children who were allegedly bullying her daughter. She said: I told them to discipline them or to keep [Shukri] behind and I would pick her up. I asked themthey would be responsible for her wellbeing everyday. I would pick her up in the afternoon.  A boy who bothered my daughter multiple times, I visited the school and his family. He said all the kids were insulting her and so he did too. He said thataposs why he did it, the other kids were doing it too. Heaposs at home now. He has been excluded. Ms Ture said she wants to see justice for her daughter. She added: If the rights we came to the country for exist, I want something done.  My daughter didnapost go to a river, she doesnapost know it, her school is four minutes away. She used to go to an Islamic school that she loved. She would be one of the first at the school. She was a prefect. She would help the teachers. The family has accused the media of censoring their claims.Shukriaposs cousin, Mustaf Omar Mohamed, Shukri’s, told the Muslim news website  Pillars: “The police has told the media that it was a tragic accident so they have just repeated that, but we don’t think that stacks up.We don’t believe it was an accident, we believe there is more to this story and we don’t believe we are getting the answers and support we deserve from the police and the school. He added: “We know that Shukri was being bullied and so do the school and the police. It was name-calling and physical. I don’t know why she was being bullied but she was a timid, scared, vulnerable girl so she was an easy target.

Michael aposSpikeapos Lewis, , and Gareth aposGazzaapos Delbridge, , were killed by the vehicle travelling between Swansea and Cardf yesterday. Police believe the two workers, both from Bridgend county in Wales, were struck by the train because they could not hear it while wearing ear defenders. Welsh Ambulance Service paramedics dashed to the scene near Port Talbot but were unable to save the men. A third person was treated for shock at the scene.    Mr Lewisaposs family issued a statement via British Transport Police this afternoon. It said: “He was known by everyone, and loved by everyone. We would like to thank everyone so much for their support during this dficult time and ask that we are now given the space we need to grieve.” Meanwhile a Facebook post from the Kenfig Hill Rugby Social Club earlier today confirmed Mr Delbridge was the second victim.  He was described as a a long and loyal club member and friend. The post continued: He will be surely missed by all those who had the privilege of knowing Gareth. He was, without doubt one of the nicest persons you would ever want to meet, a true gentleman and an all round great guy. RIP Gareth we are all going to miss your happy charm.  British Transport Police said yesterday early indications were that the workers were using ear defenders. The initial stages of the investigation suggest that the two men who died had been wearing ear defenders at the time and tragically they could not hear the passenger train approaching, said Superintendent Andy Morgan. Following a number of urgent enquiries into this tragic incident, it has been established that the three people were railway workers who were working on the lines at the time. We have a number of officers who remain in the area and we are continuing to work alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to understand the full circumstances of what happened in the moments before this incredibly sad, fatal collision.    The two menaposs families have been both informed and we will be providing them with as much help and support as possible through this undoubtedly dficult and distressing time. Likewise, we will make sure those who witnessed this traumatic incident, both at the scene and on board the striking train, receive the necessary support they require. Police also thanked passengers for their patience,and Wales Ambulance Service responders who rushed to the scene. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workershas called for all similar works to be suspended while the crash is investigated.

Lisa Bell said when she told her son about her new surname he burst into tears as he feared his name would be changed too. The bizarre decision was inspired by a tattoo she got during a boozy holiday in Magaluf of a camel on her left big toe. After spending the day approaching men in her hotel askingtheyaposd aposlike to see her cameltoeapos, the -year-old became the talk of the strip. And on herhome, the daring cleaner decided to change her name in memory of her holiday - paying £ to legally change from Bell to Cameltoe.  Lisa - who said she wants aposlots of Cameltoe babiesapos - even wanted to change to her full name to Iva Cameltoe but she says her friends talked her out of it. Now her official documents, including chequebook and tax account, bear her new name - and even had to face the embarrassment of informing her new employer of her rude surname. While Lisa still gets the giggles when bills arrive with her name on, she claims she wonapost be satisfied until her passport is up for renewal and she can show it off on a global scale. Lisa, from Blackpool, Lancashire, said: Itaposs so funny. Iaposve never regretted it and I still love it.    I was going to change my full name to Iva Cameltoe - my first name was going to be Iva - but my friends convinced me to stick to just the surname. Itaposs not on my passport yet because it hasnapost needed renewing yet. I canapost wait to get that now. Iaposm even Cameltoe at the tax office. I still laugh when bills come through the door with my surname on them, or when I receive phone calls, because you can tell they think it must be a mistake. They say Miss Camelio or something like that.  My passport is up for renewal soon and I canapost wait to get in the name of Cameltoe, then I will book a package holiday with private transfer so some Spanish man has to stand with a board with the name Cameltoe on [at the airport]. During a girlsapos holiday in , Lisa decided to get the cartoon camel tattooed on her toe after a drunken night out. But after choosing to celebrate aposfront wedgiesapos with a new surname, she could never imagine sheaposd have to tell her future employers too. Lisa said: I was going up to groups of lads saying aposdo you want to see my cameltoe apos  The next day when I was walking down the strip, everyone was shouting aposcameltoe!apos at me. I came home and changed it by deed poll. Itaposs been that ever since. My current boss found it absolutely hilarious when I told her. She found it funny. My son was really embarrassed by me. When I came back and changed my name, my son was in tears because he thought his would change too. He wasnapost impressed.  Heaposs a bit more sensible than me. I donapost think he knew what Cameltoe meant at the time. The single prankster has even hinted at finding love so she can aposhave Cameltoe babiesapos, meaning the Cameltoe name wonapost die out. Lisa said: I said at the time I wanted to get a boyfriend and have lots of Cameltoe babies. If ever I get married, the man would have to take my name so we donapost go extinct. At the time I researched it and there was no-one  in the world with my name. The following year me and my friend got a fish on our fingers and kept saying to people apossmell my fish fingerapos.

Karen Pugh, , of Taverham, Norfolk, suffers from the rare condition Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which has no treatment in the UK. Her friends and family are now trying to raise £, for potentially le-saving surgery to help treat her symptoms. Brave Karen, who lives with husband Andy, was diagnosed in  with EDS, which leaves her in constant danger of paralysis or sudden death. The condition means the ligaments in her neck are unable to support her head.    She has to wear a neck brace at all times because her skull slips back and forwards over the top of her spine when she tilts her head, compressing her brain stem. I could decapitate myself admitted brave Karen, who used to work for the Bernard Matthews turkey firm. But because EDS is so rare, for a lot of the time weaposre seen as hypochondriacs. The  diagnosis came two years after a fall which she did not seem able to recover from. But she says that looking back, she always had symptoms she now knows are associated with EDS, such as dislocating joints. EDS causes problems with collagen, which is what the body needs to hold skin, joints, blood vessels and other major organs in place. While healthy collagen behaves like an elastic band, snapping back into place, EDS sufferers have collagen aposlike blu tackapos which doesnapost spring back, she said. It was not until recently when she spoke to another victim whoaposd had a pioneering operation in Barcelona to stabilise her skull that Karen truly realised the risk. Itaposs something that I think you get used to but Iaposve been speaking to a lady who had the surgery - Iaposve been in contact with her. Dr Gilete, the surgeon, said he very rarely sees  year olds over there in Spain because theyaposve either had the surgery or they are dead. Thataposs when it hit me.    Devoted husband Andy joined a group of  supporters on a -mile sponsored walk, and friends Laura Youngman and Terina Robinson will be shaving their heads to help fund Karenaposs vital surgery. Andy said: Iaposve seen my darling we go from an athletic hard-working fun loving woman that was always busy doing something, to someone that now struggles to hold up her own head and is at daily risk of paralysis and sudden death. She has many dislocations in her hips, knees, shoulders, etc, even her ribs. It also causes issues with her muscles and digestive system, and she is in constant pain. She always has a smile for her family and friends, but I see the daily struggle she has with this chronic condition.Karen has constant headaches and struggles to hold her head up, as the ligaments in her neck are now too weak to hold up her head.We need to raise £, for the the surgery she so desperately needs to permanently stabilise her skull and neck to stop the risk of paralysis and sudden death and also to give her a better quality of le. When Karen is able, she loves to draw for her family and friends, she also enjoys crocheting toys and gts. Unfortunately due to the severe instability in her neck she suffers debilitating headaches that can last up to four days a week. Karen is finding it increasingly dficult to be able to do the things she loves, which I find heart-breaking as she has had to give up so much in le that she enjoyed doing already due to her EDS. Karen added on her fund-raising page: Hello all, Iaposm usually a very private person so doing this appeal has been very hard for me. I have never liked asking people for help, but unfortunately I need all the help I can get.  She wrote, Dr Gilete has said that he doesnapost see many yr olds in his surgery because quite frankly theyaposd either been treated much earlier or they were already dead - and that my friends is the cold hard truth...Iaposm on borrowed time. I would much rather tell you a joke, Iaposve always been a lot better at that, but I need to tell you the cold hard truth which is a lot harder.

Footage of the moment the steamy lovemaking clip begins playing captures parents hurriedly rushing their children away as the scene from R-rated  film Pirates: Blood Brothers rolls on a screen. The clip was shown at a fun house at the Alameda County Fair in Pleasanton, Calornia, where several young children were playing on Saturday. Panicking parents told their kids to shield their eyes and shouted come on to get them away, as some stopped to look at the footage. The blunder happened after the wrong disc was inserted into the DVD player at the pirate-themed attraction.    The screen was meant to show a harmless clip from the  Burt Lancaster movie The Crimson Pirate but somehow the two discs had been mixed up. The fair organisers apologized deeply for the mistake and said the video was removed immediately upon discovery. Video filmed by a concerned parent shows the racy footage playing in full view at the entrance to the fun house. It shows a man lying on top of a woman, having sex with her as children begin to emerge from the ride exit. A girl turns to see what is playing on the screen but is quickly told to come away by her mother.    Shocked, the woman filming asks: What are they showing  Are you serious  They’re actually showing a couple having sex on a kidsapos ride at the fair. Another mother urgently distracts her son by pointing him towards another ride. As the couple finish their romp, a young boy stops and stares before being told to come on by an anxious parent. Other parents can also be heard complaining in the footage. Mother Nechelle Lemons - who filmed the video - was visiting the fair with her seven-year-old daughter.    She told KTVU: I was very upset. I went from being completely shocked that something like this would take place, and then livid. Fair spokeswoman Angel Moore said: Unknowingly, a suggestive scene from this movie was displayed on one of the monitors in view of fair guests. We deeply apologise and thank the fair guest for bringing it to our attention so that we could take immediate action to ensure this doesnapost happen again.    This video footage is not in alignment with the values of the Alameda County Fair or Butler Amusements and was unacceptable. Moving forward, all video footage and other content in the carnival midway will be reviewed for audience appropriateness before being displayed. It was not explained how the discs had been mixed up.

Ashley Buchkoe, , was diagnosed with premature oian insufficiency - a condition that caused her oies to release eggs irregularly - meaning she was experiencing the early stages of menopause. Ashley, who is an insurance specialist, and her husband Michael, , were desperate to start a family but were told by medics their only hope was IVF and their chances of this working was just five per cent. After forking out £, on fertility treatment, the pair were devastated when both of their two rounds failed in . But nine months later, the couple were over the moon when they naturally conceived their son, Porter, now -months-old, followed by their daughter, Piper, now four-weeks-old.  Doting mum Ashley, from Wisconsin, US, said: I always knew I wanted to get married and have children, then when we were struggling for over a year, I knew something was wrong. After dozens of tests with a reproductive endocrinologist, I was told I had the devastating news that IVF was my only optionI wanted to start my own family. I was so shocked to hear my body was going through the early stages of menopause, I have always had irregular periods but didnapost think it was anything to worry about. My husband, who is an iron-worker, and I had use my savings to cover the £, cost and even though we were told my eggs only had a five per cent chance of working. It was recommended that I start IVF with donor eggs as my egg count was so low, but I wanted a biological family more than ever.    We took the risk, and it was unsuccessful, we were heartbroken. I never imagined having a baby would be so hard. We were desperate to have a baby, so we gave it one more go with my eggs and maximised the medication doses, but my body didnapost agree and only one embryo was successful inserted. After two weeks, I began to bleed at work and I just broke down, I thought I was having a miscarriage. Shortly after the clinic rang and my heart sank until I had the word aposCongratulationsapos I couldnapost believe it, we were finally having a baby! Ashley suffered with premature labour contractions that left her bed bound for nine weeks before giving birth to her son Porter in January .    The couple couldnapost afford IVF again so began to accept Porter will be an only child until she miraculously fell pregnant eight months after Porteraposs birth. She adds: It was the best feeling in the world getting to hold Porter for the first time, he was everything I had ever dreamed of. We prayed for more but there was no way we could afford to have IVF again, so we were just grateful for what we already had. I went to my GP about my irregular periods to ask for some medication to try and help regulate them.    The doctor made me do a pregnancy test to double check I wasnapost before she subscribed me anything and to both of our surprise, I was! We were both in total shock, Michael couldnapost believe it either. Our dreams had finally come true and now we have the most perfect daughter called Piper, who is four weeks old. Infertility is traumatic and there were times when I had doubts that it would be successful and feared the worst but now I am blessed with two beautul children and couldnapost be happier.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who left 4000 tip","story":"NewsWoman who left £, tip using boyfriends credit card charged with theftSerina Wolfe, , allegedly paid the extravagant tip after learning that her waitress at the Clear Sky Beachside Cafe in Florida had recently put her dog downShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video woman-charged-theft-after-leaving-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has been charged with theft after she allegedly left a ,tip for a waitress using her boyfriendaposs credit card.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed

collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The music was provided by Gordon Cosgrove and Katrina Barr.For some, it will have been the youth groups that gave a point of contact with the church. These have existed under ious names – CHAOS with Sam and Jon Philips, Youth Fellowship run by Sian Galbraith and, currently, SKY , led by John Ives and the present pastor, Steve Davies.These have given young people a place to meet together and explore the Christian faith.Steve Davies indicated that the event planned for Saturday evening will aim to blend together three elements: #a historical flavour, a strong musical focus and a thanksgiving celebration#, and he added that there will be a chance to reminisce over refreshments and enjoy a display of photographs showing activities and events of days gone by.A church outing in the s.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by .

raises money to support music therapy at the hospital.The sculpture was painted by artist Hannah Sanguinetti and features Oor Wullie pretending to be a sea clf, with seabirds sitting on him. Written on the back of his bucket are lists of the types of seabirds and marine le which can be spotted locally.The  Oor Wullie BIG Bucket Trail builds on the success of a similar trail in Dundee three years ago which raised nearly pound,.This time round, sculptures of the national treasure will be seen on the streets of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and surrounding communities.DC Thomson, which has published Oor Wullie cartoon strips and Christmas annuals featuring the character and his family since the late s, has teamed up with three childrenrsquos hospital charities to share funds raised by the latest trail: Edinburgh Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity, ARCHIE Foundation and Glasgow Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity.Primary schools have also been able to get involved, with a number receiving miniature sculptures of their own to decorate. The results are being put on display around Edinburgh at locations including the National Portrait Gallery, Museum of Childhood and Ocean Terminal.Charlotte Bray, fundraising manager at the Seabird Centre, said: ldquoAs a marine conservation charity the design was spot on and is a fun representation of the local wildle.ldquoThe Jess Mackie Memorial Fund have sponsored the sculpture, which gives it a special relevance for the local community.ldquoJess was a pupil at North Berwick High School and her family have done an incredible job of fundraising for ECHC in her memory.ldquoWe are very happy to be involved in such an exciting nationwide art trail.The trail has been organised in association with Wild in Art and supported by DC Thomson Media.The sculptures were officially unveiled on Monday and will remain until the end of August.A mobile app can be downloaded, with people encouraged to take on each or all of the trails recording each sculpture as they come across it. It also shows a map of each trail and where the sculptures can be found.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-affordable-homes-at-letham-mains-haddington-under-way","story":"In total,  new council houses and a further  housing association homes are being built at the Letham Mains site, off the B near Oaktree Junction.The site has a number of dferent developers currently at ious stages of construction as more than  new homes are planed alongside a new primary school on the land.East Lothian Council said that the work on the affordable housing, which was recently awarded to Hart Builders with a total cost of pound.million, was now under way.The homes are expected to be completed in phases between spring and autumn next year, with three more affordable developments expected to start on the Letham Mains site in future years.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, the councilrsquos cabinet spokesperson for housing, said: ldquoThis is great news for current and future residents of East Lothian.ldquoThere is a clear need for new affordable housing developments and these sites at Letham Mains will help contribute to meeting our local housing strategy outcomes by increasing the supply of affordable housing and improving access across dferent tenures and house types.The new Castle Rock Edin will take ownership of the  housing association homes being built on the site.Richard Jennings, the associationrsquos managing director, said: ldquoThere is strong demand for mid-market rent accommodation in East Lothian and we are delighted to deliver an affordable choice of high-quality, well-managed homes for people wishing to be part of the vibrant new community at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, have been playing a game of liars poker with public money. Boris began by promising to cut taxes on the well off and also lt lower earners out of tax. Hunt replied by lting the threshold for National Insurance to pound,, cutting corporation tax to .% and effectively scrapping business rates for the vast majority of shops.And they were just getting started.:Letters: English nationalism demeans our politicsBy this stage, the contenders had become like poor souls in Las Vegas, at am on the third day, trying to make up their losses by going all in. Both made uncosted pledges on social care. An addled Jeremy Hunt said he would cut student debt and write off tuition fees for young entrepreneurs.The Barnett Formula, you ask  Boris Johnson may have railed against the Scottish spending calculus as ldquounfair, and ldquoinequitable ndash a tax on being English. But both he and Jeremy Hunt now praise the much-maligned formula as the essential glue of the Union, and have promised never to touch it. Indeed both candidates threw in poundbn for post-Brexit agriculture and fisheries.By now, the adults in the Tory poker room were beginning to fret. Spoilsport Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that theyd spent his ldquopoundbn fiscal headroom many times over. The Institute for Fiscal Studies went further and accused them of ldquomisleading votes by making spending pledges that could never be met, while cutting taxes for just about everyone. The IFS Director, Paul Johnson, pointed out that the poundbn was available for one year only.And Brexit  Well, Jeremy Hunts response to the Chancellors strictures was to toss in another poundbn to compensate industries hit by Brexit tarfs The IFS believe the cost of Brexit will be vastly greater than that. Yesterday, Philip Hammond said that a No Deal Brexit would cost poundbn.

Dont politicians always over-promise, throw money at the voters, spend astheres no tomorrow  Well, no actually they donrsquot ndash especially not Conservatives. You dont have to go back to the fiscally dry-as-dust Thatcher era to hear the mantra: ldquoonly spend what we can afford. The former Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, worshipped a god called ldquoprudence in the s, believing that Labour had lost successive elections because it couldnt be trusted with the purse strings of government.In  the Tories formed a government with the Liberal Democrats, which pledged to restore the nations finances by the most radical cost-cutting. It was called ldquoausterity\". George Osbornes programme was compared to the ldquoGeddes Axe ndash the eye-watering spending cuts imposed by the coalition Chancellor, Sir Eric Geddes, in .:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyIts worth reminding Jo Swinson, as she bids to be the next LibDem leader, that the Liberal Democrats endorsed Osbornes austerity. Indeed, Vince Cable, still says that austerity was ldquonecessary\".No one  seems to be saying that. There has been a seismic sht in the politics of public finance as politicians have suddenly abandoned the old language of fiscal rectitude. And not just in Britain. President Macron of France has had to reverse his public finance reforms. Donald Trump, despite all his rhetoric, has just put forward a record . trillion budget.What seems to have happened is that politicians of left and right, but most strikingly of the right, have become influenced by the rise of the populists. Populism is often wrongly regarded as a traditional conservative ideology boosted by anti-immigration nativism. This is a mistake. Asand YouGovs six-month study of the phenomenon pointed out, populists are much more left than conventional right, and generally seek to reduce inequality.ldquoThis is not something we expected to see, said Kirk Hawkins of . ldquoPopulism, in the end, is attractive because it takes seriously the grievances of people who feel abandoned and unfairly treated. In the crucible of Brexit, the traditional party of the right has realised that it must do something to address these grievances, or cease to exist as a political force.Im not suggesting that populists are the New Left. Only a fool would believe the promises being made on public spending. Donald Trumps spending splurge has largely been on defence and building a border wall. But the change in the ideological agenda is too striking to ignore.Jeremy Corbyns  Labour Manesto emerges, in retrospect, as relatively modest in its spending proposals. The SNP under Nicola Sturgeon is also beginning to look a little, er, conservative in its approach to public finances.As the former SNP MP George Kerevan pointed out, the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission report, with its plans to hold spending to % below GDP, has many similarities with the austerity programme of George Osborne after . At the very least, the SGC represents a covenant with the Scottish electorate that an independent Scottish Government would only spend within its means and would not indulge in radical deficit financing.Tell that to the Tories! Theyve discovered the magic money tree. They seem to be adopting the left wing economics of Modern Monetary Theory, which says that public spending deficits dont matter because governments can always print money.Of course, this is all in the context of Brexit. We are in an age of febrile politics. There will be a reckoning. When its over, and the tide goes out, well soon see, as Warren Buffet likes to put it, whos been bathing without their costume on."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Why age isn   t a barrier to power in our youth-driven society","story":"You canrsquot help wonderingthe rumours about Mr Corbynrsquos declining memory, attention span, strength and general fitness come from real evidence of reduced capabilities, orthey are a fiendishly contagious conspiracy, cooked up to topple him before he has a chance to become the next Prime Minister. Scuttlebutt insists that the -year-old is nothing but a puppet, leaning on colleagues for support, mouthing their ideas, and too decrepit to do much more than clutch the lectern and issue an occasional rallying call to his troops.With most unfrail alacrity, Mr Corbyn has refuted all these suggestions ndash apparently made by senior civil servants ndash and is asking for an independent inquiry into whoever is spreading such lies. He is right to insist on this, but sadly the damage is already done. Now every blink and tremor, every hesitation and stumble, will be cause for analysis and concern.No-one beyond the Labour leaderrsquos closest family and associates can know how much,any, truth this gossip holds. Wersquove been told about eye problems, but are they an indication of more serious underlying health problems  Or is it simply that the burdens of office are exhausting him, making him appear older than his years  Impossible to tell. With a man whose demeanour has always been more energy-saving bulb than dynamo, it is dficult to detect any appreciable dimming of wattage.As questions were being asked about his ability to run the party, let alone turn the key in the door of Number , I found myself thinking of Mr Corbyn when watching democratic hopefuls for the next US presidential nomination. Bernie Saunders, who will be  in September, is impressively impassioned, but he cannot surely be anybodyrsquos idea of the perfect candidate, given the demands that would be made of him in arguably the most high-profile and pressured job in the world. Joe Biden, too, at  is scarcely a spring chicken. Like Mr Saunders, he was born while the Second World War was getting into gear. As for the American president, even his worst enemies have to concede that at  he still seems to be possessed of enough energy to make international deals and travel the globe, with never a sign of flagging.This might all sound unpleasantly ageist. Yet with a few notable exceptions, most mortals begin to slow down intellectually as well as physically as they reach their biblical span of three score years and . This is not to say that there are not many fruitful, useful and enjoyable years ahead, but it is to suggest that the gruelling schedules expected of modern politicians, be they first ministers or presidents, senators or MPs, is no longer an arena in which those past their prime will easily flourish. A century ago, there would have been little or no public outcry over an elderly or enfeebled prime minister or party leadercolleagues could keep the government on track. In this, Britain had the benefit of centuries of precedent with royalty. From before the Stuarts to George III, kings and queens, with a little help from friends at court, continued to pass edicts and legislation, sign death warrants and go to war, while, whether through ill health, insanity or senility, they were completely unfit for office.Read more: Labour demands probe into civil serviceWith the onward march of democracy, however, has come greater visibility, transparency and accountability. Technology might have transformed our domestic workload, but for those in the political front line, the digital revolution has turned night into day. Dedication and accessibility   is the least voters now expect. No wonder so many images of MPs shows them in running gear, pounding the pavements and turning strawberry pink. This is not just a metaphor but a practical necessitythey are to survive the punishing regime their role demands.Despite much talk about our fast-ageing population, there has never been a period that is so youth-driven, or when the old have been so easily and cruelly dismissed as irrelevant or past-it because they have one foot still in a pre-tech world. The gulf between those born while ration books were circulating, and those whorsquod mastered an iPhone before their milk teeth were cut, is eye-wateringly wide. What does someone of pensionable age understand of the Snapchat generation  Other than the most basic human needs, such as security, work, and dignity, which transcend any barriers of time and class, colour and creed, what can an elderly politician offer a youthful electorate Well, perhaps more than yoursquod think. Clearly, what wersquore witnessing with the ongoing popularity of those like Mr Saunders and Donald Trump, is the triumph of longevity and experience over vigour. Their retro appeal is in part thanks to a letimersquos accumulation of high-powered connections and skills. Why be surprised that some dream even now of Ken Clarke taking over the Tory Party to bring it to its senses, despite him being almost as ancient as the Fortingall yew  Or that others rejoice at the distant prospect of Ann Widdecombe resurrecting her political career and ing as a Brexit Party MP.Experience, and the informed perspective it allows, is by far the greatest advantage of seniority. Is this what the young see when they look at people like Mr Corbyn, who lavishes more care on his allotment than on clear-cut policy yet commands widespread respect and even affection or why the venerable-looking Mr Saunders made such an impression with his brand of democractic socialism that he threatened to make Hillary Clinton toast It would seem so. Evidence suggests, indeed, that despite living in a world designed for youth, where to be in any way incapacitated or slow is to be invisible and ignored, we are nevertheless hard-wired as humans to defer to age. Rightly or wrongly, our instincts tell us that with wrinkles or bald pate, dentures or dodgy knees, comes hard-won wisdom. You might even argue that, far from being a handicap to reaching power, advanced age is actually an asset."},{"url":null,"title":"time-to-get-your-act-together-auntie-or-get-your-coat","story":", eh  Following the publication of its annual report, does anyone seriously think it will take that long for patience with the BBC to run dry Every year it is the same.

Having worked for the BBC in the past, I continue to appear on it occasionally and should include myself in those ranks.Tough love needs to be dispensed because those at the top of the corporation are clearly not getting the message. It is time, dear Auntie, to get your act together or get your coat.The corporationrsquos defence can be split into three parts. First, it is not to blame for . million pensioners losing their free licences. Correct. A Labour government introduced the measure, a Conservative Chancellor, George Osborne, then dumped the bill in the BBCrsquos lap after barely any public consultation.Next defence: the BBC has to pay talent what it is worth otherwise the stars will go where. Nonsense. Certainly, the BBC has had some of its better known names quit for the private sector, among them Chris Evans, Eddie Mair, and Simon Mayo. But there are only so many Evans-size salaries out there, and only one Chris Evans. The idea that private enterprises are ready to splurge vast reserves of cash on an exodus of BBC talent is laughable. What would their shareholders say for a start : BBC says it is doing wellAs for the old Lrsquooreal defence ndash the stars are worth it ndash really  Gary Lineker is worth more than a Prime Minister, a First Minister, a surgeon, a teacher, almost any profession you care to mention  Steve Wright, for pressing buttons and singing over the music, merits a pound, pay packet As for Huw Edwards, almost half a million pounds for anchoring the news, a skill that can be summed up as ldquoreading aloud  It is not just on-screen iniduals either. More than  managers earn over pound,.Meanwhile, the poor bloody infantry, the ones who put in the night shts and the weekends, the ones who make the talent shine, are stuck on low pay and rolling contracts that offer little in the way of job security. Never mind, they can at least comfort themselves with the knowledge that the gender pay gap between well paid men at the corporation and well paid women is closing, with three women now in the top ten earners. As for everyone , good luck with the claims, now inching along like tipsy slugs.The last of the BBCrsquos defences is that it costs a lot of money to provide what it does, but it still provides great value. The answer to that is simple: stop doing so much. No one asked for BBC Sounds. No one asked the BBC to build a vast online news empire, paid for by the state, that took jobs, readers, and advertisers from newspapers.: Anger as Beechgrove is prunedThe new BBC Scotland channel is a case in point of the corporation trying and failing to deliver what it thinks viewers want.Take, for example, The Nine, the channelrsquos flagship news show. Just the blend of local, national and international news required, all of it from a Scottish perspective. You see reports on here you never would on the Six or the Ten, which fulfils the remit exactly. It is the kind and quality of show thatit had been on at six orsquoclock would be hauling in the viewers. But it is on at nine orsquoclock, right up against the mainstream channelsrsquo big hitter dramas and documentaries, so its viewing figures are ridiculously low.The Nine languishes where it is because the BBC in London was terried of a Scottish Six, fearing it would be a sop to nationalism. To disguise that lack of courage a whole new channel was constructed at greater cost. While some of the new channelrsquos offerings have been well worth watching, Yes No: Inside the Indyref chief among them, they could have easily found a home on the existing BBC  Scotland. As for the rest, the stale soup of repeats and shows that should never have been made in the first place ndash who needed another quiz show  ndash are dragging the channel down. When it comes time to make cuts, as it inevitably will, which programme will go: the relatively expensive The Nine or the cheap as chips fare The corporation might tell itself it is catering for a new, younger viewer who watches television in a dferent way, but there it goes again, looking in the wrong place for answers. Instead of trying to please a generation that wonrsquot pay for anythingit can get away with it, the BBC should be satisfying its existing customers more.The BBC will never have pockets deep enough to match Netflix or Amazon. What it does have is the ability to do certain things very well, such as drama. More Bodyguard and Killing Eve and less dross would be just the thing for the discerning viewer. People do not want an endless choice. Just scrolling through the Netflix menu is becoming exhausting.By cutting back the big wages, and building on the success of Studios, the corporationrsquos profitable production and distribution ision, the BBC can start to get serious about reducing its dependence on a licence fee that is not going to be around forever.In Years and Years there was a happy ending, normal civilised society was restored and the BBC came back.

He concluded with a plea to the council to visit the site and ldquoremove the said eliphant.He wrote: ldquoAdam Kerr baxter, burgess of Edinburgh humbly complaine upon Abraham Seyboura Dutchman owner of the eliphant that where I having ane shop and oven at the head of the fishmercat close with a back vault to the south thereofhellipwho keeps his eliphant therin and exposes the same his Dung and water thereof comes so doun upon my said vault that it has spoylt the samehellip and comes doun in great quantities upon the vault and spoyle and abuses the concerned goodsrsquo.According to city archivist Vikki Kerr, further research revealed the owner of the elephant had also raised a petition with the Town Council, asking for permission to parade his animal for the pleasure of the cityrsquos residents.ldquoItrsquos the first time wersquove found that kind of petition in the Town Council minute and shows that people at that time were getting the chance to see something quite dferent and exciting as an elephant walking down the High Street, she said.The elephant is said to have been kept within a building near Fleshmarket Close, named after a nearby meat market. A stonersquos throw from the Royal Mile, the Old Town area around the close is now popular for short-term holiday lets and Airbnb properties.Ms Kerr added: ldquoItrsquos hard to imagine an elephant going up a narrow set of stairs, so we can only think that the bakersrsquo shop and oven were on a lower level and the elephant might have entered at street level.ldquoMost of the letter is quite legal and pompous, and we havenrsquot been able to find out what happened next, although I suspect the Dean of Guild would have wanted to visit to see it for themselves.Indeed, the female Indian elephant had already endured an unhappy le before reaching Edinburgh, having apparently been shuffled around ious European cities after first being shown at a trade fair in Leipzig in  when she was already around  years old.Over the course of the next  years, she was displayed across Europe, travelling between Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Switzerland and France accompanied at times by an ldquoAfrican Jungle-Donkey ndash thought to be a mandrill or an aardk ndash and a bizarre three-legged animal.She eventually arrived in London in  and was touring England when her owner, Bartel Verhagen died. His will stipulated that his prized elephant should be passed into the care of assistant Jan Janszoon, however, she ended up being rented out to Mr Sever.From the time of her original ownerrsquos death to her own demise, the elephant is said to have earned  guilders, compared to an ordinary Dutch labourerrsquos earnings of around  guilders a year.Despite the financial benefits of keeping her alive, Mr Severrsquos lack of experience in elephant handling ndash and a decision to trek her north to Aberdeen in late winter ndash left her starving, exhausted and frail.But while her death in a ditch just outside Dundee may have been sad, it also led to the first dissection of an elephant in Britain, carried out by surgeon, botanist and anatomist, Dr Patrick Blair.Historian and author Andy Drummond, who researched the lsquoDundee elephantrsquo in his book Elephantina, said the discovery of the letter is another fascinating insight into the elephantrsquos unfortunate le.ldquoShe gave a demonstration to the Duchess of Hamilton in  and then trampled off to Aberdeen in March and towards Dundee, he said. ldquoThe elephant keeled over in Broughty Ferry because of the weather and lack of food.ldquoItrsquos a little sad, but at the same time people benefitted greatly, such as Dr Blair.His pioneering scientic study of the animals internal organs and skeleton brought him fame and recognition at the highest level.ldquoHe couldnrsquot believe his luck, added Mr Drummond. ldquoHe basically took it apart bit by bit, while someone documented all the things he pulled out of the elephant in drawings.ldquoHe then had a very long scientic paper published in the journal of The Royal Society in London.\"According to Dr Blair, the elephant stood just over  feet high and  feet from nose to tail.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers.

Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has issued a public reminder about the correct and incorrect disposal of asbestos.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

It also leads to contamination of some our recyclates meaning they can’t be sold on or  used where – thereby reducing valuable income and adding additional cost burdens to the Council.#If you witness misuse at any of the Recycling Centres please do not hesitate to contact the Council to advise and help us to minimise any disruption to our services to the public.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But when we think of summer, in the most idyllic sense, our heads fill with colour and warmth. Hazy, dfused circles of heat creeping over snapshots of times past moments of action frozen in time. I don’t want mundane days I want everything in summer to be as full and vibrant as ripe fruit, evenit’s just the extravagant laziness of doing nothing at all to the fullest possible extent.The quintessential summer, in my own mind’s eye, takes the form of one specic picture: sitting on my grandparent’s front steps, eating an ice pole, while the neighbour downstairs gardened and I picked paint off the railing to look at layers of colour underneath. A warm day with the flowers blooming, blue skies and distant lawnmowers, the sweetness in the air of my nana’s roses, suspended in time forever. When my mind wanders, thinking of summer, that moment is always there. I cycle through other scenes: the intention,not necessarily weather-permitting reality, of beer gardens. My papa packing a flask of tea before a day out in the car. Touching the chilly North Sea as a wave comes in. Lying on my back reading, while there’s a breeze blowing in and nothing to do: in a caravan, with the door open and gas stove hiss of tea being made, or rain pattering on the roof. Sometimes I think about being suspended on a plane, with nothing to do but waste away time with a book before stepping out into unfamiliar humidity.: The indignity of modern train travel – Laura Waddell: Fleabag: Priest’s sexual advance has got people talking – Laura WaddellNostalgia is the ultimate Instagram filter, but hope is close behind. When we daydream of the summer we want, we’re not thinking of nothing at all, but of a clearly defined atmosphere, one we want to plunge entirely into, dferent from our everyday lives rather than merely undoing them. Temporarily, we enter alternate reality, whether through memories or hope for how our summer might look. The city itself looks dferent in the sunshine. We rediscover gardens and parks. New ways of being are possible. I walk around looser in my skin, later into the day. We don’t want to drop out of reality entirely – other than a break from everyday chores, tedium, or anxiety – so much as we want to e headfirst into glorious feeling. Sights and sounds, cut crass, chilled wine, and sunshine langour. Summer is intense, in the way that the orange of Aperol spritzes is intense, the smell of lavender is intense, and heat on our brow is intense. Deeper sleeps, longer lies.It’s rarely so idyllic, all of the time. But the best stories, of course, also temporarily take us out of reality and set us down where. And so they are, I feel, the ideal summer reads – like for like. There are some practical considerations. Physically, you’ll probably want a paperback that can be chucked in beach bags or shoved down into a backpack alongside bug spray, water bottles, sandwiches and sunscreen. Books are made for using even an object fetishist like me, who spends a lot of time looking at book cover design, still batters their corners.If I’m travelling I might seek out something set in the destination ahead to double up on discovery. This year, ahead of a pinching-myself lucky work invitation to Vienna to celebrate Bloomsday – books have enabled me to travel to new places, literally as well as figuratively – I dipped back into Austrian author Stefan Zweig’s shorter stories, full of emotion, which often depict longing in settings such as hotel rooms and train stations, reflective of his status as a Jewish intellectual dispersed during the Second World War. His experiences have never felt irrelevant, and his storytelling skills are classic. As I work in the book industry, for summer reading I often choose books I don’t have to review, write about, or recommend in any way. No publication dates looming. A dissolution of everyday demands. It’s a rare, weightless chance to browse shelves without looking for anything in particular, although inevitably, I’ll weigh myself down from trips to bookshops wherever I go.Recently I did an author reading in Shakespeare and Co, the revered, ramshackle, cat-installed English language bookshop in Paris, celebrating the launch of an anthology called We’ll Never Have Paris which invited a sprawling number of writers to depict it as they see fit a theme that emerges is reconciling the Paris of romanticised imagination with the everyday reality. While I was there, I pluckedLauren Groff’s Fates and Furies from a high and tightly packed shelf, a bestseller from a couple of years ago that I’d been meaning to read for ages. It’s a dense and lyrical book exploring one marriage’s successes, sacrices, and hidden rages. While keeping cool from the record-breaking heatwave sweeping Europe, I also read Heartburn by Nora Ephron, a short, sharp satire of eighties New York and Washington society full of wit, humour, and recipes, and Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miriwhich shows the city from a rare perspective, that of a homeless labourer asking himself whether years of gruelling work building Olympic stadiums had been worthwhile, capturing the everyday atmosphere of transient camps.In the summer, with more time to wander and get lost, I gravitate towards books that will immerse me in their world some of the very best hazy-dayed reading memories I have include plunging into Donna Tartt’s addictive New England intrigues, Elena Ferrante’s two fists full Napoleon epic that took me through all seasons, and Samanta Schweblin’s eerie Argentinian bio-horror Fever Dream.Each to their own, of course. Wholeheartedly, I believe anyone should read whatever they want, should they choose. But for me, summertime reading will always be something I can travel through, as much as with, taking me to places I don’t yet know or deepening my imagining of those I do, but crucially, upending reality just like a strike of sunlight washing over my face is able to.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"labour slip to fourth place in latest opinion poll","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour has slumped to fourth place in a new opinion poll.The party is backed by just % of voters, two points down on a week ago, according to a YouGov survey for The Times.The Tories have climbed two points to stand at % while the Brexit Party is up one point to % and the Liberal Democrats also up one to %.: Jeremy Corbyn says Scottish seats are key to Labour win With Labour leader Jeremy Corbyns Brexit strategy under intense scrutiny, the survey found that only % of Remain backers intend to support Labour.This compares with % of Remainers who said they would vote for the party at the beginning of the year, and % who gave it their backing at the end of April.Just % of Leave supporters say they will vote Labour, compared with % in January, according to the poll.Labours shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told ITVs Peston: \"I dont believe that would be the result at a general election.\"If that was a result at a general election it would be devastating for the Labour Party.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership hopefuls promise to defend the union as polls show a 50 50 divide","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is now on an #inexorable journey# towards independence as a result of Theresa May#s time in office, as the Prime Minister makes a final visit north of the Border today before standing down.Mrs May will urge her successor to make safeguarding the union their “greatest duty” and also defend her own record on strengthening the UK during her three years in Downing Street.Leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will address a hustings event in Perth tomorrow night, days before postal ballots are sent to Tory party members who will elect Mrs May’s successor.The Tory leader will set out plans for a review of the UK government’s approach to devolution as she addresses an audience in Scotland this afternoon, but it has been dismissed as “too little, too late” by the SNP leader.The First Minister also warned that Mrs May’s successor will never “undo the damage” she has done to the Union.The SNP government at Holyrood is seeking to stage a second referendum on leaving the UK next year, in response to Brexit uncertainty.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

What we are trying to avoid here is a no-deal Brexit which I think would be a very considerable burden for businesses in Northern Ireland and across the two islands.“That’s what we are trying to avoid and that is what the report does in trying to set up a dferent way of solving the problem and issue of the Irish border.”Panel chairman Shanker Singham highlighted that one of the proposals was the establishment of a Government fund to help financially support businesses who had to increase their administrative capabilities.He said the arrangements could also be implemented with the use of existing technology.“Media often says it’s all about technology – it’s not all about technology,” said Mr Singham.“Technology is not the driver for the solution, but it’s equally absurd to say technology plays no role at all.“Technology has a component – it supports the technical and administrative processes we are talking about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"government looks to further delay requirement to call stormont poll","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the same time it is my responsibility to plan for all scenarios and to ensure there are effective contingency measures in place.“This Bill is necessary to ensure good governance and the continuation of public services in the event that the parties cannot come to an agreement before  August. We should all encourage the parties to ensure it is not needed by restoring the Executive in the coming weeks.”It is understood a group of cross-party MPs are considering proposing an amendment to Mrs Bradley’s Northern IrelandAct  that would compel the UK government to legislate for same sex marriage in the region.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A new mural of Lyra McKee in Belfast city centre That move could be frustrated howeverthe Government attempts to fast-track the bill through the Commons without amendments.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led powersharing coalition imploded in January  when the late Martin McGuinness quit as Sinn Fein deputy first minister amid a row about a botched green energy scheme.The fallout over the renewable heat incentivewas soon overtaken by disputes over the Irish language, same-sex marriage and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.On Wednesday, Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy claimed the pace of talks has gone into “go-slow” mode ahead of the annual July  parades across Northern Ireland celebrated by unionists and loyalists.But DUP MP Gavin Robinson hit back, accusing Sinn Fein of “making excuses” and of a “lack of engagement” in the talks.On Thursday, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said he has been “working intensively” with Ms Bradley to support the political parties in finding an agreement that will get all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement up and running again.“We have today seen the introduction by the British Government of an amendment to UK legislation to extend the period for calling an Assembly election,” he said.“This step underlines the seriousness of the absence of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, and the urgent requirement for an agreement between the political parties on operating the institutions again.The governments will have to make an assessment before long on whether it is possible to move quickly in this period to final agreementSimon Coveney“The two largest parties have a particular responsibility to reach an accommodation to secure the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.“The two governments have called on the parties to continue to participate in this dialogue with each other towards a sustainable accommodation for all, and we will continue to engage with all the parties in discussions on the outstanding issues.“The governments will have to make an assessment before long on whether it is possible to move quickly in this period to final agreement.“The government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38279370.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/security_alert_.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts security alert ends at nutts corner road","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_fbab-e--afa-ebfbfe_EmailThe EU’s trade deal with South America countries is “disappointing” and “not satisfactory” for Ireland, Employment Affairs Minister Regina Doherty has told the Dail..pushMs Doherty said Ireland was not the only EU country that would feel the “negative connotations” of the Mercosur deal but she said the text of the agreement was not yet complete and the details would take some time to iron out.The proposed agreement between the EU and a group of countries including Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, was reached last week after  years of talks.It has been heavily criticised by environmental groups and by beef farmers who believe it will lead to poorer quality beef flooding the EU market at the expense of Irish farmers.Questioned by Fianna Fail’s Dara Calleary about whether the government should be endorsing the deal and pressed on whether she was standing on Agriculture Minister Michael Creed’s team or whether she was standing with beef and poultry farmers, Ms Doherty said she was “on Team Ireland” and wanted to limit any potential negative impact of the deal.The agreement, which includes a signicant tarf rate quota thatll allow beef imports from Mercosur countries, obviously is a disappointment to every one of usRegina DohertyThe Meath TD made the comments as she stood in for Tanaiste Simon Coveney during Leaders’ Questions on Thursday.“The agreement, which includes a signicant tarf rate quota that’ll allow beef imports from Mercosur countries, obviously is a disappointment to every one of us,” Ms Doherty said.“That’s why we’ve been working for the last number of years to bring it from where it was to where it is now but I think as you can agree there’s a long way to go.”She added: “It is disappointing.” But she said the Irish government would continue to work hard with colleagues in Europe “to try to mitigate the impacts” of the agreement as it currently stands.“What is agreed today is not satisfactory from our perspective but also equally is not satisfactory from other people’s perspectives across Europe,” she added.“The Taoiseach was fairly clear yesterday and the day before that we’ll work over the next couple of years with the influence we have collegiately with other countries and with our Commissioner… to make sure we reduce the impact on our beef and poultry sectors.”She warned it could take “at least two years”not longer to agree and align with others to ensure a level playing field across governance, across carbon production and across quality was reached.In response Fianna Fail’s deputy leader said “everybody’s on Team Ireland”  but that the government was “abandoning our core agricultural industry”.“MinisterCreed is on Team Ireland but he fell asleep when he was on the pitch,” Mr Calleary claimed.“Is CommissionerHogan on Team Ireland “Commissioner Hogan is the cheerleader of this deal but I’ve noticed there’s more Fine Gael tanks being placed on Commissioner Hogan’s lawn that we’ll see in Washington later today because he’s going to become your scapegoat for this.“Our beef farmers, our poultry farmers and our pig farmers are on Team Ireland but they’re not really feeling the team spirit at this stage because they’ve been thrown to the wolves.”He continued: “So many people in this country are on Team Ireland in terms of our climate and what do they see “They see our government acquiescing to a deal that rewards climate change deniers, that rewards the destruction of rain forest, that rewards low standards.”"},{"url":null,"title":"twelfth fortnight shutdown thing of the past with firms taking more flexible stance","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

And for construction firms,  will be the second year in a row in which an industry body has recommended stoppages for just two days - Friday, July  and Monday, July .However, Mr Webb said that people were still in the habit of booking their holidays over the first two weeks of July, regardless of company policy on stoppages. And with many offices giving their staff both the public holidays of July  and July  off, he said it was a wise move as staff only need to take eight days of annual leave to get a full two weeks off.A spokesman for Harland and Wolff confirmed it will close on Friday, July , with no weekend shts, but reopens on July . However, aerospace company Bombardier said it will close from tomorrow and reopen on July .

Meanwhile, dairy co-operative Dale Farm said its production facilities were open all year round.Newry company MJM Marine said it closed on July  and  but that due to work commitments, some of its staff would still be coming in.Mr Webb said that even though companies were staying open during July, a quietness had descended on Belfast. \"The economy does slow down during this period, even a lunchtime walk through Belfast city centre reveals a noticeably quieter place,\" he said.  \"While tourists appear plentul, office workers appear in shorter supply. \"So, while the Twelfth brings a slowdown in activity here, the traditional shutdown is a thing of the past and tourists coming in are offsetting some of the local exodus.\"Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said: \"July remains a signicant holiday period for Northern Ireland with many locals going on holiday both within NI and abroad.\"However with the growth of tourism we are also beginning to see an increase in out of state visitors during the same period. \"With the majority of our hospitality businesses opening as usual, trading does see geographical shts to our key local holiday destinations and around major events.\"The Construction Employers Federationindustry body announced in  that it was ending the -year tradition of observing the Twelfth fortnight as an annual holiday.And Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the concept of the Twelfth fortnight had died out in the manufacturing sector around three decades ago. \"Theres been a big sht over recent years where very few places actually close down completely over the Twelfth,\" he said.\"But it was never really unorm all across NI.

He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For this project they teamed up with Ballyoran Seniors who are based at Ashgrove Community Centre on the Garvaghy Road.They went on conducted tours of the Boyne Visitors Centre and Drogheda and also to the East Belfast mission to learn of the Celtic origins of the area and also hear Linda Ervine outline her work in Turas, the Irish and Scotch Gaelic school, operating from the Mission’s headquarters at Skainos House on the Newtownards Road.Also a visit to the Oireachtas in Leinster House in Dublin where they had an opportunity to see the Dail and Irish Senate in operation. They were hosted at this event by Senator Ian Marshall, a self-confessed Unionist from Markethill who gave an enlightened viewpoint in his role in the Senate. Joe Garvey, Chairman of the Association said: “Many of us were taught little about Irish History or how our cultures came to be developed. Often people only learn a narrow aspect of history. The objective of this project, like previous ones, was to give a broader perspective on our backgrounds and how all the communities on this Island can live in harmony and respect each other’s traditions. It was also an opportunity for our two groups to work together for the benefit of our communities and we look forward to sustain the good relations that have been developed.” The Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Margaret Tinsley, congratulated Richmount Rural Community Association and Ballyoran Seniors for coming together to develop better community relations.She said: “Embarking on such projects can be challenging and Richmount Rural Community Association must be commended for its efforts in promoting peace and respect in our communities. I am aware that the Association has been leading the way in this field and it is also one of the few locations in the Borough to have a magnicent Peace monument.“It is also noteworthy that the Association has taken its message of peace to work with other communities such as Glenravel in Co Antrim and across the border with Corduff Raferagh in Co Monaghan.“I know the work in peace and reconciliation still has some way to go and I am pleased that Richmount and Ballyoran are currently engaged in Peace IV project on reimaging and shared spaces as it has the desire for the Richmount Centre to be seen as a shared space and welcome to all in the community. I would just encourage you to keep up the good work.”Frances Hayes, Chair of Ballyoran Seniors also commended the Association for taking the initiative.She said: “At the outset we were not sure what we were letting ourselves in for but what we found was a warm welcoming group of people. We are now working together for the mutual benefits of both groups and we have enjoyed embracing the concept of learning about other cultures and the need for mutual respect”.Stunning new £.m youth

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme.
