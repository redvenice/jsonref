Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A question from a sample paper of the higher level Leaving Cert Mandarin Chinese exam. Niamh McNally is a Mandarin Chinese teacher:  “The Leaving Cert course is designed so that when you enter fifth year, if you have no language background, you are well capable of taking the course in two years and achieving a good grade.” Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Sanda Sanduta and Carla Quinlan with teacher Niamh McNally: “I’m very glad I’ve chosen to study it for the Leaving,” says Sanduta. “I’m excited to be one of the first students to sit the new exam,” adds Quinlan. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw When asked what motivated them to study Chinese for the Leaving Cert, students at Our Lady’s Grove Secondary School in Dublin’s Clonskeagh give varied answers.“It’s just so different,” says sixth year Carla Quinlan. “I wouldn’t consider myself the best at languages, but I’m loving Chinese. I love the foundation of the characters, when you see one matches up with the other . . . ”For Sanda Sanduta, also a sixth-year student, it has been about getting a window into Chinese culture.“I was watching Chinese TV shows and dramas, even before I started to learn Chinese,” she says. “I just had never had the opportunity until I came to school it’s one of the reasons I chose to come here.”As for principal Colm Dooley, the decision to offer the subject made sense for many reasons.“There are great opportunities for the girls. China is a huge training partner. And it’s going to be for their generation we’re educating for tomorrow, not for today,” he says. “We’re a State school surrounded by private schools and affluence here is something which we feel is niche and will give them another feather in their cap.”Students at Our Lady’s Grove are among an estimated 100 nationally due to sit the first ever Mandarin Chinese exam on the Leaving Cert curriculum this summer.Like traditional foreign languages on the curriculum such as French and German, there will be oral and aural elements, along with a written exam at higher and ordinary level.Unlike other languages, however, it is aimed at students with no prior knowledge of Chinese. Yet, on the face of it, the sample paper – which requires candidates to read and write using Chinese script – looks fiendishly difficult.Prior knowledgeStudents point out that the language has relatively simple grammar. For example, there is no verb conjugation (so, no need to memorise verb tenses) or gender and number distinctions. In theory, a student taking up the subject in fifth year should be able to complete the exam and get a good grade.The availability of Chinese on the Leaving Cert is part of a wider strategy launched several years ago under then minister for education Richard Bruton to expand the choice of foreign languages in schools at a time when trade links are growing in emerging countries.While Chinese is the most eye-catching new addition to the Leaving Cert, students this year will also be sitting the first exams in Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese as curricular languages – three languages that, due to immigration, are now widely spoken in Ireland (indeed, Polish is more widely spoken in Ireland than Irish).It is estimated that about 1,500 students will sit exams in these new language exams this summer.But is it a fad or the future?After all, there is a small pool of teachers able to teach Chinese and other minority languages.Some also wonder whether the rise of Chinese language learning is too closely linked to its economic success – with the risk that it could fade if growth in China were to flag.Karen Ruddock, director of Post Primary Languages Ireland, says there is potential to grow the numbers studying foreign languages for the Leaving Cert.Her organisation is helping to make teachers available to schools – in person or remotely – and facilitating access to weekend classes if languages are not available locally.More generally, she says the global dominance of English has given rise to the mistaken belief that “English is enough”.This, she said, can result in complacency and a lack of motivation to learn other languages.Teacher shortage“Learning a foreign language will create more work opportunities, more chances to make friends and have great life experiences,” she said.A major obstacle, however, is teacher supply. Even among the most common foreign languages such as French and German, there is a shortage of qualified teachers.The Chinese government in recent years has stepped up the activities of the Confucius Institutes – a network of cultural diplomacy bodies tasked with increasing China’s “soft power” around the globe – to help boost teacher supply.The government funds visiting teachers in about 10 schools in Ireland and has subsidised cultural trips to China.While Confucius Institutes are often likened to the Alliance Française, critics say they are aggressive in pushing Beijing’s world view and shutting down discussion of any topics regarded as politically sensitive such as China’s human rights record.Indeed, links with the Chinese government in the rollout of the new Leaving Cert course have been at the centre of controversy.Last year, it emerged that an adviser paid by the Chinese government is to have an “oversight” role in the subject as part of an agreement between the Department of Education and its counterpart in Beijing.Ruddock, however, says the adviser will have “zero oversight” in the design of the curriculum their role will be limited to supporting teachers with continuous professional development or initial teacher education.“This is happening very much under our direction we have oversight and have our own Chinese language adviser . . . it is literally a supporting role. If we’re offered additional expertise at no cost, we’ll say yes – but it’s very much under our direction . . . The idea that somehow the Chinese government will come and do whatever they like is nonsense.”The department’s decision to use only a simplified script in the new Leaving Cert exam in Mandarin Chinese has also sparked anger among some campaigners.Traditional or heritage Chinese script is used by most people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other mostly non-mainland-China locations.Ruddock says this approach was agreed following an extensive consultation process with the education sector.Our Lady’s Grove has had visiting Chinese teachers in the past, but it recently hired Irish teacher Niamh McNally – a “brilliant addition”, says principal Colm Dooley.There can sometimes be cultural barriers in teaching methods with visiting teachers, he says, with a bigger emphasis in China on teachers being a “sage on the stage” compared to the more student-focused approach in Irish schools. McNally completed Chinese and business studies as part of an arts degree at Maynooth University, before living and working in China for three years.She says while many students are intimidated by the Chinese script, it is eminently possible to learn the language.“It is a beautiful language and the grammar is nothing in comparison to what we’re used to with our European languages. There are no conjugations at all. It’s wonderful,” she says.“The Leaving Cert course is designed so that when you enter fifth year, if you have no language background, you are well capable of taking the course in two years and achieving a good grade . . .”As for her students, they’re hopeful they will flourish in their new subject.“I think any language is useful and I’m very glad I’ve chosen to study it for the Leaving it should be a bonus wherever I go,” says Sanduta. “I’m excited to be one of the first students to sit the new exam,” adds Quinlan. “I’m not sure what I want to do, but I know I’d love to take a trip over there one day.”Going global: new Leaving Cert languages for 2022* Senior cycle students can study the curriculum with no prior knowledge of Mandarin Chinese* First exam in 2022 with the option of ordinary and higher level* Saturday classes available in Dublin and Cork for students who do not have access to a teacher.* Expected standard similar to current Leaving Cert languages of French, German, Spanish and Italian* Aimed at – but not limited to – learners from heritage language backgrounds* First exam in 2022 ( higher or ordinary level) and includes oral and listening skills.* Standard similar to current Leaving Cert languages of French, German, Spanish and Italian* Specification designed to be inclusive of all varieties of Portuguese* First exam in 2022 ( higher or ordinary level) and includes oral and listening skills.* Standard similar to current Leaving Cert languages of French, German, Spanish and Italian* First exam in 2022 ( higher or ordinary level) and includes oral and listening skills."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"but i just had covid why omicron is driving up reinfection rate","story":"Andrew Byrne contracted Covid in November and December 2021Andrew Byrne (25) contracted Covid-19 for the first time in November but had very mild symptoms and thought he had “cheated Covid”. A month and a half later, he tested positive for the virus again.The rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant throughout the State has had an impact on not just daily case counts, but also the number of re-infections.In Byrne’s case, his first experience with the virus largely felt like a bad head cold. However, the second time “it was a much worse dose”.“I woke up with really bad pain, chills, I couldn’t get out of the bed. Bright lights gave me a migraine. Fatigue was setting in – I was finding it hard to stay awake when watching TV and there was a general feeling of tiredness in my muscles and my body,” he said.After several days, Byrne said the symptoms eased and returned to what he described as head cold-type symptoms.Byrne, who had the one-shot Janssen vaccine, said he was “really surprised” when he contracted Covid again, as it was only six weeks after his initial dose.“I thought I’d be okay for at least three months,” he added.Dr Gerald Barry, a virologist at UCD, said Covid reinfection has always been possible, but the likelihood of it has increased with the latest variant of concern.A study from Imperial College London found the risk of reinfection with Omicron was 5.4 times that of Delta.Case volumesIn Ireland, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) said it could not provide figures for the number of Covid reinfections in the State, as a result of the current Covid-19 case volumes.Barry said: “The idea that if you’ve had an infection previously that you’re immune or protected from a new infection, that’s just not the reality with this virus.”The body creates memories of previous infections, which then trigger a quick antibody response if exposed to the same virus again, he explained.However, as a virus mutates, the body becomes unable to recognise it as quickly as it previously would have, allowing the person to become infected.“If you’ve had an infection previously, you could be exposed to the same virus a lot, and if the antibodies are still high in your body within weeks or months post that initial infection, then, although you’ll be exposed to it, it’s very unlikely the virus will take hold,” he said.“But if you have a new variant that your body hasn’t seen before, then the virus has a much higher chance of taking hold, particularly in your upper respiratory tract, and you might see symptoms of infection.”Reinfection is not just a risk with the Omicron variant, either, according to Dr Barry, who said he had heard of people contracting Delta more than once.Dominant variantLinda Coogan Byrne contracted Covid-19 in January 2021 and again in the summer of that year, a time during which Alpha was the most dominant variant in circulation.“I was absolutely floored,” Coogan Byrne said. “My chest was really sore. My taste and smell went away and it took about six weeks to come back. And there was brain fog too.”However, the second time, the most severe symptom experienced was night sweats, a difference Coogan Byrne attributed to the previous infection, as well as having been fully vaccinated by that time.“You do build up a tolerance, I think. It wasn’t that bad at all the second time. Waiting it out was the biggest inconvenience.”Milder symptoms in subsequent infections is common, according to Dr Barry, particularly if the second infection is with the Omicron variant.This is both a result of the antibodies from the previous infection, and the early indications that Omicron causes less severe infection, he said.Considerably milderThat was the case for Helen Whelan, whose symptoms were considerably milder when she contracted the virus the second time in early January, despite not yet being vaccinated on either occasion.When Whelan first contracted it in September 2020, she had a headache, sore sinuses and a cold, spending the 10 days “pretty much in bed with no energy and sleeping all the time”.The second time has been much more manageable. “I’d describe it as a bad head cold more than anything but I haven’t missed a day of work.”Craig Dwyer, who contracted Covid-19 twice in just over seven weeks, had a similar experience.The first time he had it, in November, he had extreme fatigue, and the symptoms of a head cold and sinus infection. The second time, last week, it was only a scratchy throat.“I’m not feeling too bad at all this time,” he said. “I was hoping that because I had it already, I would have some sort of immunity, but I guess I didn’t.”Dwyer (32) had the one-shot Janssen vaccine, and now must wait three months before he is eligible for a booster for additional protection.“I’m probably a little bit more nervous now than I was after contracting it the first time, because I thought I had a bit of immunity then.“I don’t necessarily feel as safe or protected. I’m really hoping I can just go the three months so I can get a booster.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet may meet as early as friday to approve easing covid restrictions","story":"If Nphet gives favourable advice following its meeting this week, Cabinet could meet as early as Friday.

Recent days have seen daily case numbers collapse and the situation in hospitals remains manageable, though busy. Both Mr Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar have made optimistic noises about reopening in recent days.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said he hopes for the quickest return to normal life possible, and that he thinks some measures will be lifted before the end of the monthEmergency powersSpeaking to RTÉ’s News at One programme, Mr Donnelly also said it is his hope that emergency powers relating to Covid-19 will not be renewed when the legislation enabling them lapses at the end of March.“My view is we introduced emergency powers to deal with this, we introduced very difficult measures to deal with this, and they were necessary and are necessary where the public health rationale to keep people safe is there.“What I want to see and what we all want to see is the quickest possible return to normal life and the lifting of all the restrictions where possible, but critically in a safe and balanced way so we don’t squander the very hard fought gains the country now has.”While Mr Donnelly wouldn’t be drawn on what specific measures may lapse first, and said that steps would be taken informed by public health advice, he nonetheless believed restrictions could be relaxed before the end of the month.“What people need is certainty and that’s what we’ll have in the coming days,” and that it was a question of what was the “best and safest way” to do so.Mr Donnelly said the intention was to invest and plan for the future of the pandemic, even as restrictions are loosened.“At the same time, what we’re doing is the medium term work to make sure we have the national defences in place to make sure that if another variant of concern arrives we can respond quickly.”Digital Covid CertElsewhere, Minister of State Ossian Smyth has said his hope is that the obligation to produce a Covid-19 cert domestically will expire at the end of March.

They’re part of the restrictions that are due to expire on 31 March,” he said.“I don’t want them to go beyond that.”Expressing the view that there were non-financial costs to public health restrictions, borne of keeping people apart and regulating social contact, Mr Smyth said: “Putting in restrictions and keeping restrictions is not just something we can keep doing, it’s building up and I think there’s a limit to how much people can take.There were 979 Covid-19 patients in hospital on Tuesday morning, down from 1,006 the previous day.However, ICU numbers had increased on Monday to 97, the highest level since December 23rd last.The positivity rate dropped to 45.2 per cent on Monday, down from highs of more than 50 per cent a week ago, although changes to testing rules in the interim make direct comparisons difficult.On Monday, an additional 9,970 booster vaccines against Covid-19 were administered, giving a total of 2,472,236 booster doses.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the booster vaccination programme had given a “window of opportunity” against the Omicron variant of the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ashling murphy remembered as woman who lived her short years to the full and made a difference","story":"Ashling Murphy was remembered as a kind, talented, loved and admired young woman at her funeral Mass in Mountbolus, Co Offaly.Ashling Murphy’s first-class pupils from Durrow National School hold a photo of their teacher outside the Church of St Brigid, Mountbolus, Co Offaly. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosBishop Tom Deenihan of Meath, who spoke at the funeral of Offaly school teacher Ashling Murphy, said that her death had been a depraved act of violence which deprived a kind, talented, loved and admired young woman of her life, but that it had since united the country in grief and support.Her murder also asked questions of society as a group and as iniduals. “It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality. Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen, but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture. Pope Francis in his homily for New Year’s Day just two weeks ago said that violence against women was an insult to God.”Bishop Deenihan offered his sympathy and support, on behalf of the people and priests of the Diocese of Meath, to Ashling’s family and friends.“The past few days have been a nightmare. A walk on a mild and sunny afternoon in January should be a happy event, promising the brighter and warmer days of spring and summer. That, as we know, was not the case.“We all know that no inidual should die like Ashling and no family should suffer like Ashling’s. Respect is an old-fashioned word, but it is an important one. Respect was missing last Wednesday but it has re-emerged here all the stronger. Let us respect each other.“We bury a woman who lived the short years given to her to the full, who developed her talents, who reached out to others, who made a difference, who brought happiness and who was loved.”The funeral Mass featured numerous family members in the readings and prayers of the faithful along with the musical responses. Among those participating were Ashling’s cousins Emma Murphy and Lorraine Dunne while her godparents, Ger Leonard and Regina Murphy, brought to the altar the items representing her life – a Killoughey-Kilcormac GAA jersey, a family photo and a school book.The prayers of the faithful were read by Ashling’s cousins Siobhain Maher and Alisha Leonard, Ciara Leonard and Aoife Leonard, Rachel O’Shea and Caoimhe Dooley who prayed for Ashling’s friends, colleagues and students in Ballyboy Comhaltas, Killoughey-Kilcormac Camogie club and Scoil Naomh Colmcille, Durrow, their neighbours and friends, for the emergency services, all the staff at Tullamore hospital and An Garda Síochana.Local parish priest Fr Michael Meade gave the homily in which he said the grief of the community was the heavy price of love. “Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt – this is the heavy price we pay for love.We gather as a family of faith, to be with, to support by our prayer and our presence, those whose darkness is deep, whose pain is raw and fierce. Kathleen and Ray, Cathal, Amy and her boyfriend, Ryan – you have been robbed of your most precious gift, a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family.“Many centuries ago, four very important words were delivered by angels, first to Mary who said yes, then to lowly shepherds who came to see. We all need to hear those same words again: ‘Do not be afraid.’ These words are for all of us who have walked with, who have gathered in vigils, who gather today in wherever space we are – let us not be afraid to pray for one another, let us not be afraid to make change a reality in all our lives, change for what only is good.“The issues raised in many ways and by many voices since this horrible act of violence invaded all our lives will, we pray, continue to evolve and bring the change we need so much, to simply give and show respect.“That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up – it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher. Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy, today we share our love, our grief, our faith and our comfort with the Murphy and Leonard families.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"champagne event bubbling over to make coveney look accident prone","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: Nobody organised a party or danced the night away. Coveney’s involvement seems to have been limited to a brief speech. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill There is a mixture of bemusement and fear in the Government about the controversy over the champagne quaffing at the Department of Foreign Affairs shortly after Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020.Bemusement that the issue has reignited a year and a half after it was first apologised for and fear that controversy is escalating – Downing Street-style – into a major political mess.The story seems certain to run for some time yet. The Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss on Tuesday whether to request (another) attendance by Simon Coveney to answer questions about the conduct of his department and his own decisions.One doesn’t need a long memory to recall Coveney’s appearances at the committee a few months ago to discuss his abandoned appointment of Katherine Zappone. A repeat is unlikely to be a prospect that the Minister for Foreign Affairs greets with any relish. After an ill-judged first appearance, he returned for a more conspicuously contrite second stint at the committee a week later. It was a deeply damaging episode for him.Damage causedThe memory of that controversy and the damage it inflicted on the wider Government at the time is still fresh and is causing colleagues and others to wonder if Coveney hasn’t become rather too accident-prone. With a reshuffle of Fine Gael Ministers already advertised for the end of the year, there is no shortage of rivals and frenemies willing to discuss this issue. Whatever about that, Coveney’s refusal to answer any questions about the department drinks over a period of weeks now seems to many people to have been a mistake.The department itself is by turns mortified at the blunder – and irritated that so much is now being made of what most officials honestly believe to be a venial sin. Of course, there are others who are annoyed that the department was effectively dobbed in by its former secretary general, Niall Burgess, whose posting of a photo of the event (hastily deleted a few hours later) now looks like a classic social media gaffe. Burgess has since been posted as Ambassador to Paris, not exactly a hardship post. His successor, Joe Hackett, is compiling a report for Coveney.Downing Street comparisonIn such febrile political times, these controversies can take unpredictable trajectories. But it would be hard to seriously place them in the same category as the Downing Street high jinks. Colleagues who were working closely together shared a few bottles of champagne (or worse, prosecco, according to one person). Nobody organised a party nobody danced the night away. Coveney’s involvement seems to have been limited to a brief speech.It seems fair to conclude that the re-emergence of the controversy owes more to the comparisons with Downing Street than it does to its inherent seriousness."},{"url":null,"title":"coveney to be asked to appear before committee over champagne party","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will be asked to appear before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about the impromptu champagne celebration held by staff in June 2020. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will be asked to appear before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about the impromptu champagne celebration held by 20 members of department staff in June 2020.The Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs met on Tuesday afternoon to make a decision on how the committee plans to examine the gathering.Sources say it was agreed that Mr Coveney will be asked to appear while members also want to see the terms of reference of an internal investigation ordered by Mr Coveney.It emerged on Sunday night that Mr Coveney last week asked the general secretary of the department, Joe Hackett, to examine the circumstances. A tweet of a photo posted by then secretary general Neil Burgess – now the Irish Ambassador to France – shortly after Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council showed people celebrating with champagne in Iveagh House.It is likely that Mr Coveney will appear after the internal investigation is complete.It is understood concerns were expressed during Tuesday’s meeting about Mr Hackett carrying out the investigation and that committee members believe the investigation should be independent of the department.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has said Simon Coveney should come before the Foreign Affairs committee over the champagne party in Iveagh House, and raised the possibility that senior civil servants may also be invited to account for the event.Significant issuesSpeaking before a meeting of the committee today, Sinn Féin’s spokeswoman on defence, Sorca Clarke TD, told reporters that there were significant issues to be addressed over the gathering, which occurred after Ireland won a seat on the UN security council in June 2020.“The Minister absolutely has questions to answer about this gathering and this event, the lead up to it, the night in question, and what transpired afterwards,” Ms Clarke said.“It is clear from the quotes that he has put out, and the statements he has put into the press, that he was aware of this event from very early on.“There are also questions in the run-up to this that needs to be answered, and ultimately the minister is responsible for the actions of his department and the committee is responsible and it’s part of our remit to scrutinise the minister.“At this stage we’re looking for a clear explanation of what happened, in leading up to that night, the night itself, and then afterwards,” she said, adding: “Who else was aware that this event had taken place, why hasn’t it come to the fore before now, while other events did and had gained so much traction”.Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, who is also on the committee, said that there is “nothing to say we won’t explore this further”, when asked about whether senior civil servants may be asked to the committee – although in the first instance, the focus is on Mr Coveney.Asked about members of staff at Iveagh House who were at the event and who have since moved on to ambassadorial roles, hence with diplomatic immunity, Ms Clarke said: “That’s a question for themselves, the committee door is always open to them”.Mr Ó Donnghaile argued that the move to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs in was not political. “It’s a very legitimate ask that the Minister would come in front of us, particularly in the context of Covid and the restrictions and what so many people were asked to undertake,” he said.“The Minister is the line manager. He’s in charge, it’s his Department.“I don’t think it’s particularly political that a scrutiny committee would ask a Minister to answer questions when something like this has happened.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"anxiety voted childrens word year","story":"Anxiety has been voted the children\u0027s word of the year, highlighting impact of lockdown and school closures, say the Oxford University Press.More than 8,000 pupils were asked to choose the top words they would use when talking about health and wellbeing and their experiences of lockdown.Researchers say the findings highlight the impact that lockdown and school closures had on children.For more than a decade, lexicographers, experts and academic researchers in the Children\u0027s Language department at the OUP have analysed the changes in children\u0027s vocabulary and self-expression.The department will be updating their dictionaries and resources for schools to reflect the current usage of the words - such as bubble and lockdown - in relation to the pandemic.New phrases such as self-isolation will be included.Helen Freeman, director of early childhood and home education at OUP, said: The research highlights the vital role language plays for children when it comes to self-expression, learning and wellbeing.It\u0027s important now, more than ever, that we invest in supporting children\u0027s language development at home and in school.The findings demonstrate the role we all play in making sure children have the words they need to be able to express themselves and that, as adults, we are aware the language we use around children can significantly influence their learning and wellbeing.The views of more than 8,000 children across the UK, from Year Three to Year Nine, were represented by teachers taking the survey.Wellbeing was selected as the focus of the vocabulary research for 2021.This was prompted by the impact Covid-19 has had on children\u0027s education and the growing awareness of children\u0027s mental health as a key concern.Joe Jenkins, executive director, social impact from The Children\u0027s Society, said: It\u0027s concerning that \u0027anxiety\u0027 is the number one word but it isn\u0027t surprising when you consider all the restrictions and changes children had to endure.The charity\u0027s Good Childhood Report, which was published in August last year, found that more than 300,000 UK children were estimated to be unhappy with their lives in 2018-19.Mr Jenkins added: Having conversations and using the right language is incredibly important when supporting children if they are feeling anxious, isolated or going through tough challenges, and it\u0027s also crucial children are able to express how they are feeling.Teachers from the 85 schools involved in the survey were also asked for the word they use most often when talking to their pupils about health and wellbeing in the context of the past year.Last year\u0027s Children\u0027s Word of the Year was coronavirus, and in 2019 it was Brexit.More from NewsCovid latest news: Scotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirmsProfessor accused of treating PhD students like slaves wins £15k payoutKiller of children’s author Helen Bailey on trial for murder of first wifeWatch: Why Prince Andrew\u0026#39s Royal career is now officially overClimate change and congestion forces Indonesia to build brand new capital 1200 miles awayMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has acting like fox news left","story":"One may feel slightly cynical about Nadine Dorries’s timing of her announcement about the future of the BBC licence fee. The freeze for two years was already known. Her talk of a new funding model by 2028 is vaguer than her rhetoric implies. She is choosing this moment because of the BBC’s coverage of the revelations about Downing Street parties during Covid. This is more politics than policy.The problem is that the BBC has made it easy for her. I actually do believe that Tim Davie, the director-general, is serious about impartiality, but the corporation’s implementation of his Action Plan is slow in that special way that only great bureaucracies can manage.The story about Boris and parties is a classic case where the national broadcaster needs to show super-impartiality but the coverage has showed no recognition whatever of what Mr Davie seeks.On the contrary, from the news that starts the day to Newsnight, with presenters like Lewis Goodall, which ends it, the BBC has tried to prove that this is the worst scandal in living memory and will be fatal to Boris Johnson’s premiership. It has dragged out the sort of disgruntled Tory backbenchers it normally despises and given them endless airtime to attack the Prime Minister. It is not far off being a Fox News of the Left, taking a line and incessantly promoting it.Newspapers, too, have made a great meal of the scandal, and a good read it has often been. But this is exactly the sort of occasion where a compulsorily funded broadcaster should not try to ape Fleet Street. If you had relied solely on BBC coverage last week, you would have concluded that Boris was about to be kicked out. There was almost no presentation of the contrary view – which precedent suggests is likelier to be right – that he probably wasn’t.As a result, the BBC under-served its audiences, who crave news that is calm, balanced and correctly prioritised. The biggest story in the world last week (and this) is the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine. The BBC virtually forgot this.The news that a Chinese agent had donated nearly half a million pounds to the office of the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was also strong – a much more significant example of apparent political corruption than the standard “Tory sleaze” tales which the BBC relishes, yet it was downplayed.Some BBC presenters, including Dan Walker, tweeted against Ms Dorries’s plans. Every time they behave like this, they help her, and hinder Mr Davie.When the phrase “fuel poverty” first entered public debate a few years ago, I criticised it as a cant concept invented by subsidy pressure groups. Why single out fuel? If you are poor, you find it hard to pay for all essentials. The poor needed help in the round, I argued, not through price controls and special government interventions.Nowadays, however, the phrase “fuel poverty” is wholly justified. The stupefying energy price rises coming our way are caused only in part by the surge in global energy demand after Covid. These intense market pressures will right themselves over time. The grave added problem is the decisions by governments of both parties to rig the energy market for other ends.Because these governments have decided there is a climate “emergency” and that net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 is the remedy, they have deliberately forced up household energy bills by adding green levies to them. For the same reason, they have taken measures to reduce British production of the fossil fuels – particularly gas – which our country can plentifully supply and will need for years to cover for the “intermittency” of wind and solar energy.Theresa May’s energy price cap was a clumsy statist measure to mitigate this self-created problem. It does nothing to solve it, and it has already driven many small energy suppliers out of business.So yes, we are indeed fuel-poor, and getting poorer. And therefore, many are cold, and will get colder.A similar approach increasingly governs this Government’s attitude to food production. How long before we find ourselves facing policy-induced “food poverty”? I have just invented the phrase, but there is already a word for the consequence – hunger.Here is this column’s final word about the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s connection with Surrey. Having served there as a curate, benefitting from the kindness of the Lambert family in Bletchingly (see this Notebook two weeks ago), he returned many years later in archiepiscopal splendour to marry Uvedale Lambert’s grand-daughter, the jeweller Cassandra Goad, in the family chapel.“The Archbishop then proclaimed, to cheers and laughter, ‘I think we can safely assume that the Good Lord has decided to bless this particular union today’ before handing it back to the groom for a second go.” Many years later, the couple are still married, so he would appear to have been right.More from NewsAshling Murphy funeral: Man arrested on suspicion of murder as thousands gather to mourn teacherCovid latest news: Scotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirmsProfessor accused of treating PhD students like slaves wins £15k payoutKiller of children’s author Helen Bailey on trial for murder of first wifeWatch: Why Prince Andrew\u0026#39s Royal career is now officially overMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"curse covid can leader survive pandemic","story":"If Boris Johnson wanted to console himself, he might say he’s far from the only politician having deep post-Covid political problems. No one, not even Keir Starmer, is immune from scrutiny of their behaviour in lockdown – and almost no leader, anywhere in the world, can claim their pandemic strategy was a success. Everyone gambled – and to a greater or lesser extent, everyone lost. Now, the political reckoning begins.From Australia to Israel, most of those who were in power at the start of the pandemic have either lost power – or look as if they soon will. Lockdowns brought agony but not the benefits that their advocates promised. Imperial’s Neil Ferguson predicted the lockdown he recommended could reduce deaths to about 20,000 – up to two-thirds of whom, he said, might have died within a year anyway. The death toll now stands at seven times this figure and after Britain has suffered some of the strictest, longest lockdowns in the world.In Sweden, at the other extreme, the Prime Minister who fended off lockdowns lost power after a coalition power struggle. Stefan Löfven’s restraint meant Sweden ended up with no diktats and the least economic damage in Europe in 2020. But there was no political idend for him. The deaths that did happen – half of which were in woefully-unprotected care homes – were not forgiven. Löfven’s prize for keeping Covid out of the headlines was to be scuppered by mundane issues like rent control.The world over, it’s hard to find any leader who can genuinely claim their Covid policy was a success. It’s all too easy to find leaders who have panicked and abandoned their previously-vaunted principles. “We’re not a country that makes vaccination mandatory,” said Justin Trudeau. But his government is now exploring it, a logical segue for a Canada which imposed draconian no-jab, no-job policies for public transport staff. Québec is even proposing a tax for the unjabbed. The approval rate for how Trudeau handled the pandemic was 59 per cent this time last year it’s now 41 per cent.Australia is now abandoning its ‘zero Covid’ policy but Scott Morrison, its Prime Minister, is struggling to take his country with him. His decision to close off from the rest of the world came at huge social cost and some of the longest lockdowns in the world. Australia’s death toll was the lowest in the G20 and it’s now reopening, to a far-milder omicron variant. Going from ‘zero Covid’ to what he used to disparage as ‘let it rip’ seems to be a change that’s too dizzying for many Australians to cope with. His coalition government is now eight points behind in the opinion polls, with an election due in May at the latest.The original promise of Antipodean zero Covid strategies was to sit tight, wait for vaccines to arrive and then reopen to the world. Once, this looked crazy. Then, it seemed vindicated when Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna managed to come up with jabs that tested between 76 and 95 per cent effective. They’d get jabbing, then reopen: Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, said last year would be “the year of the vaccine”. She was as good as her word: in both New Zealand and Australia, 92 cent of those eligible have now been double-jabbed.But we now know that vaccine protection wanes quite quickly, hence the need for boosters. Omicron now dodges AstraZeneca’s jab, and two jabs of Pfizer are not much better: UK tests show they are just 20 per cent effective against infection from omicron after 15 weeks. So the Australians and New Zealanders who made such progress with the double jab find themselves vulnerable to a variant that needs boosters (taken by 18 per cent of Australians and 14 per cent of New Zealanders). Even booster protection wanes: to about 40-50 per cent after 10 weeks, according to British studies.This is why endemic Covid, not zero-Covid, is looking like the only sensible option. But the journey to this conclusion is a political Via Dolorosa for those leaders who spent two years espousing zero Covid strategies. Ardern was lucky to have had her re-election during the pandemic, in a New Zealand where 80 per cent of voters backed her strategy. That fell to 60 per cent last October and stands at 46 per cent now. She is still two years away from a general election – so has time to recover.Joe Biden is unlikely to stand again. He was elected president on a promise to “shut down the virus” which always was a stretch. He failed, and ended up with threatening no-jab, no-job policies – which have been isive and ineffective. Americans are losing their fear of the virus: now, for the first time, the number of those disapproving of Biden’s Covid policy exceeded those who back it. His approval ratings have now fallen faster than any leader in modern American history.He is in trouble for all kinds of reasons: the Afghan debacle, inflation and more – but Covid is proving the crowning issue. His Covid policy is now backed by only a minority of Americans. Micah Roberts, a Republican pollster, summed it up: “As goes Covid, so goes the Biden presidency, and that’s really proving to be quite true.” Biden’s staggering borrow-and-spend package was billed as a response to the pandemic but there was always a risk of pouring the fuel of borrowed money on the fire of a rebounding American economy. Inflation is now higher in America than at any time in the last 39 years.In Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s lockdowns have not really paid idends. The curfews, the curbs on weddings are all still in place – in a country where the omicron variant is still spreading fast, but posing nothing like the threat of the original strains. Sinn Féin, the official opposition, is now 10 points ahead in the polls. Martin needn’t fight an election for three years, so he has time to recover. But a Covid effect can quite clearly be seen.Those who fought elections during the height of the panic benefited from the phenomenon of rallying behind the flag and the leader in time of crisis. Mark Rutte’s record on Covid persuaded Dutch voters to overlook his other shortcomings and re-elect him last year – but that was in March, where the sense of emergency had not abated. Talks to put togther his coalition took 271 days.The Hong Kong flu of 1968 inflicted a horrific death toll, but it was not compounded by the economic, social and public health damage from lockdowns. The difference now is that we have the technology to track new pathogens in real time. New daily data flow combines with social media to create a contagion of fear. This leads to demands that Government locks down – even if ministers think it won’t do much long-term good (as was the original UK position).It seemed plausible, back in March 2020, that lockdowns might have somehow suffocated Covid – as seemed to happen in China. Now, even China is struggling to make zero Covid work. How long is Beijing prepared to remain cut off from the rest of the world? How long can it keep plunging its megacities into lockdown after just a few cases?Johnson writhes in his own particular type of Covid agony. Other leaders broke the rules: in Sweden, lockdown advocates were caught going to nightclubs (the 34-year-old Ebba Busch) or indulging in the Christmas sales (Löfven). But there has been nothing on the scale of the No. 10 nightclub: with eight separate parties in the Prime Minister’s home under investigation. When Buckingham Palace was bombed in 1940, the Queen Mother famously said that now she could “look the East End in the face.” The Prime Minister now has precisely the opposite problem. On May 20, when he attended his drinks party in No. 10, a Bletchley Park codebreaker was buried – with hardly anyone at the funeral, as per Johnson’s orders. Could he look that family in the face?The madness continues. The decision to order children to wear face masks in school, I understand, was made when an incorrect figure was flying about inside Government, claiming they cut transmission by a third. An official study this month found a difference in Covid absences of just 0.6 percentage points between schools where pupils wore masks and those where they did not. Only last week, Sage modellers admitted that they got omicron models badly wrong. How many other restrictions were ordered on similar mistakes?This will be remembered long after Covid. It is now (rightly) harder to use intelligence to justify military action in future, it will be harder to use modelling to justify restrictions on people’s lives. Just as Iraq eclipsed everything else Tony Blair did over his 10 years, the lockdowns – and the Prime Minister’s behaviour during them – may eclipse everything else he did, even the Brexit deal. “It might be a Churchill moment,” says one backbench Tory. “We’d thank him for his effort in Brexit and the pandemic, but it’s time to turn the page and the nation wants a new leader.”There are lots of reasons that leaders fall, especially after a protected crisis. The crash of 2008 claimed many political scalps, as did Iraq. A failed consensus has many political victims, because those who presided over the mistake enter denial. They cannot recognise what they did was wrong – so, unable to adapt, they need to be removed. The political future may well belong to those who can restore the liberties that lockdown measures tore away. And the new leaders will be those who can talk plainly about the collateral damage, something that those who ordered lockdown struggle to acknowledge.In the first lockdown, allies of the Prime Minister said he wanted to be both Churchill and Attlee – to win the Covid war and then oversee the rebuilding effort. He will soon announce the end of Plan B restrictions and say it’s time to move on. But he may find that there are too many of his past mistakes – Partygate and much more – to allow for that.More from NewsCovid latest news: Scotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirmsProfessor accused of treating PhD students like slaves wins £15k payoutKiller of children’s author Helen Bailey on trial for murder of first wifeWatch: Why Prince Andrew\u0026#39s Royal career is now officially overClimate change and congestion forces Indonesia to build brand new capital 1200 miles awayMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons scotland becoming everything swore against","story":"According to her boss, Lorna Slater is “an incredibly hard worker”. Let’s just pause a moment to consider this endorsement.Slater is one of two Scottish ministers drawn from the ranks of the Green Party. Her boss is the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who appointed her in the first place and therefore has a vested interest in Slater’s success in the role.But the minister has been criticised for supposedly telling her civil servants that even during the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, she wanted no more than two ministerial appointments a day in her diary, that she didn’t want to start work too early, had plenty of time to eat and an adequate number of days off.This is, to say the least, would be a list of unusual demands, particularly since COP26 represented everything that brought every Green Party member into politics in the first place. If a Green minister prioritises her down time even as world leaders meet to negotiate an end to climate change, you have to wonder what circumstances might persuade her to forgo a long lie. After preferred gender pronouns, the environment is the Greens’ top priority, but what kind of priority allows a Green minister to get to the pub on the first night of the summit by 17:30?All of Slater’s alleged demands seem perfectly sensible for your average worker on average wages — a description which does not, unfortunately, include Slater or any of her ministerial colleagues.I never worked harder than I did during my relatively short ministerial career: early mornings, back-to-back meetings and speeches, briefing sessions — all day, every day. And it was wonderful. It was a privilege. It was the best job I ever had and I was incredibly lucky to have it.Perhaps, even as co-leader of her party, Slater was unaware of the pressures of a life in politics, particularly the unusual and extraordinary pressures that being a minister entails. She was a Green, after all — what reason had she to speculate about the workload of a minister?Let’s return to the first minister’s inevitable defence of Slater’s performance. Just to be mischievous, let us take her at her word and assume that Slater is, as Sturgeon said, “an incredibly hard worker”. 1. impossible to believe. an almost incredible tale of triumph and tragedy2. difficult to believe extraordinary. the noise from the crowd was incredibleSo, that’s a useful context, and accurate if “impossible or difficult to believe” is what the first minister intended. Perhaps she meant that compared with other colleagues and their workloads, Slater’s own ministerial tartan box is heavier and more substantial, taking up even more time than anyone else’s.This also has the ring of truth to it. After all, the civil service can only generate so much work for 27 ministers. In pre-devolution days, the old Scottish Office managed to get by with one Secretary of State and four ministers under him, dealing with health, education, transport, the economy and justice, plus anything else that came their way. An increase was obviously necessary after devolution. But 27? Really?Of course, Slater’s supporters — which includes a smattering of Scottish Labour MSPs from the Corbynite wing of the party — will cite the need for ministers’ roles to be modernised, for their leisure time to be respected, for their family life and mental health not to be compromised by the demands of helping to run a government department.In fact the Scottish Parliament itself was set up specifically to reform and reject anything that smacked of the “old politics”— i.e. anything that Westminster did.So no more late night votes, no more early starts, no more working in parliament on Mondays or Fridays (these would be designated “constituency days”). Procedures too were changed, not necessarily for the better, but to make them different from Westminster, which at Holyrood amounted to the same thing. So MSPs could refer to each other by name instead of constituency, the Speaker was referred to as “presiding officer” and instead of having a confrontational “us and them” style chamber separated by two sword lengths, the parliament was made semi-circular in shape, all the easier for its denizens, when the mood took them, to clasp hands and hum Kumbaya my Lord together.Slater and her new job are part of that 21st century makeover. Working all the hours that God sends for the good of your country is just so…well, Westminster. Ministerial work now must fit into a minister’s social life. Now that really is incredible.More from NewsAshling Murphy funeral: Man arrested on suspicion of murder as thousands gather to mourn

treating phd students like slaves wins 15k","story":"A professor accused of treating a pair of PhD students like slaves by asking them to do her gardening, redecorate her home and go underwear shopping has won a £15,000 payout after a tribunal ruled she was wrongly sacked.Prof Shuang Cang from Northumbria University was investigated by police for modern day slavery offences after two postgraduate students alleged they were “just servants to her”.The Phd students from China claimed Prof Cang forced them to cut down trees in her garden, move heavy furniture, dispose of her rubbish and pay for meals, an employment tribunal heard.Chinese-born Prof Cang, who has worked in the UK for 30 years, was also accused of demanding the pair be available to her for 12 hours a day to run errands.The students, both in their 30s, said they feared they would not be awarded their doctorates if they did not comply with the demands from the 59-year-old academic.One of the students had said it is Chinese culture to “do what teachers say”.During the lengthy police investigation, Prof Cang denied the allegations or insisted they were exaggerated in what she claimed was a “collaborated attack” against her.Although detectives dropped their slavery investigation into her, the “excellent” and “impressive” professor was sacked by the university for gross misconduct.Now, the tribunal has ruled Prof Cang was wrongfully dismissed with a judge saying the panel couldn’t be sure the accusations were true.The tribunal in Newcastle heard that Prof Cang joined the university’s faculty of business and law, on a salary of £63,000, from Bournemouth University in February 2018.Her Chinese PhD students both claim they were “coerced ” to relocate from Bournemouth, with the threat of them failing their PhD.One student, named only as “ZW”, was a 34-year-old male from Shanghai, while the other, “DC”, was a married woman in her 30s.Allegations listed in a tribunal report included: “Oppression and exploitation of students by forcing them to carry our physical work in her house such as furniture moving, garbage disposal, garden clearance, cleaning and painting rooms.”But Prof Cang, who was “visibly shocked” when she was arrested, said the allegations were unfounded and that she enjoyed good relationships with the pair and considered them “like her own children”.She said the only chores she could remember them doing was the washing up and half an hour’s worth of ironing.The tribunal also heard there are “serious concerns” ZW committed plagiarism and cannot now be found, and DC may have had a “motive to lie or exaggerate” to obtain an extension of time granted to study in the UK.Employment Judge Tudor Garnon said he can’t be sure the allegations were true and criticised university academics Prof John Wilson for his investigation and Prof John Woodward for the disciplinary hearing he chaired.Judge Garnon said: “There are huge gaps in the questioning of the students and areas of their evidence which needed to be investigated further to look for real corroboration or the lack of it.“Based on what we know now and with the obvious gaps in the questioning of ZW and DC, we are not satisfied the university has shown the serious allegations of Prof Cang taking advantage of them to be more likely than not to have happened”, he added.Prof Cang won £14,884 for wrongful dismissal, £2,234 for untaken annual leave, and £30.34 for unpaid expenses.She lost claims of discrimination and harassment based on race and must pay a £1,000 deposit to the university.More

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

Plan B restrictions aimed at tackling Covid- are due to expire this month on January , subject to a review, while the self-isolation period has now been cut to five days.An announcement on Plan B is expected at some point this week, while new self-isolation rules came into place on January . The rule tweaks are signicant for parents, teachers and children, as the change aims to tackle staff shortages of people in key roles, such as teachers and those working in the NHS.The proposal has drawn criticism from those fearing it may be too soon for people toto work after being infected. The UK Health Security Agencyhas previously described the plans as counterproductive. How long do children need to self-isolate for   The rule changes mean that all people, including children, must isolate for five full days before ing to school. Previously, people in England who were fully vaccinated could end their isolation period after seven days, providing they tested negative via a lateral flow teston days six and seven. The government explained the guidance: All people – including pupils parents and teachers - have to isolate for a minimum of five full days after the day of a positive test before then going back to schoolthey have tested negative twice.  The day a person tests positive is considered aposday zeroapos. The first full day, aposday oneapos, is the day after their first positive test. Any child hoping toto school on the sixth day must test negative on the fth full day and the day after. If a child is still testing positive on these days, they must continue to self-isolate until they test negative for two days in a row. Whatmy child is not fully vaccinated  In an overhaul of the rules, the government now says people living in England may leave self-isolation after five full days, whether they are vaccinated or not.Children are not legally required to self-isolatethey are in the same household as someone who is positive. If a person in the same household tests positive, a child can continue going to school providing they take a daily test.  The government guidance says: If you are fully vaccinated or aged under  years, and you live in the same household as someone with Covid-, you are not legally required to self-isolate. Those ages over five are strongly advised to take an LFT every day for seven days. This should be taken before a person leaves their home that day.Full guidance from the government can be viewed here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SchoolsCoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After losing the leadership contest in , Mr Hunt was offered a role on the front bench, but turned it down becoming a backbencher and leading the HCSC.Mr Hunt has been extremely loyal to the PM since - and that loyalty will be needed as seven Tory MPs are calling for Mr Johnson to quit.The PM is battling to save his premiership amid public anger from the public and his own MPs over partygate. Speaking on a trip to a North London hospital, Mr Johnson said nobody told me a boozy bash in lockdown would have broken Covid rules. Sir Roger Gale, a veteran backbencher described the PM as a dead man walking.  The former Childrenaposs minister Tim Loughton said Mr Johnsonaposs position had become untenable. Many more Tory MPs have expressed their fury anonymously but are keeping quiet until Whitehall enforce Sue Gray concludes her report on Downing Street parties. The Sunday Times reports around  Tory MPs have submitted letters of no confidence, perilously close to the threshold. And another, Anne Marie Morris, told the Mirror she submitted a letter of no confidence before Christmas… but it no longer counts, because she’s lost the whip over an unrelated issue.If a leadership election does arise, Mr Hunt would be up against Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak, Sajid Javid and even Nadhim Zahawi.Foreign Secretary Ms Truss is said to be a favourite with Tory party members.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

The Chancellor said of course I do when askedhe accepted Mr Johnsonaposs explanation to MPs about his attendance at a boozy bash in the Downing Street garden in the first lockdown. But he warned that the ministerial code is clear on the rules for anyone who misleads Parliament - and then swtly departed a pool interview. An ally of the Chancellor said the interview had not been brief and he had answered more questions than the agreed three. Mr Sunak broke cover on Tuesday after keeping a low profile while rows raged over allegations of boozy bashes in Downing Street.  Mr Johnson admitted in Parliament last week that he briefly attended a BYOB gathering in the No  garden on May   - but tried to claim he thought it was a work event.Ex-aide Dominic Cummings claimed the Prime Minister had ‘lied to Parliament’ and multiple witnesses aposwould swear under oathapos that he did. In an explosive blogpost, Mr Cummings said the PM was warned that the event was against the rules but he waved it aside. Askedhe believed Johnsonaposs account to parliament, Mr Sunak told reporters: Of course I do - the Prime Minister set out his understanding of this matter in Parliament last week. But he refused to give Mr Johnson his full backing, with a warning that the ministerial code was clear on what should happenanyone lied to Parliament. Askedthe PM would have to resignit was proven he had lied to parliament, Mr Sunak said: Iaposm not going to get into hypotheticals. The ministerial code is clear on these matters. But as you know, Sue Grey is conducting an inquiry into the situation. I think itaposs right that we allow her to conclude that job.  He then abruptly left the interview, with an aide standing in front of the camera. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Rishi Sunak is running scared once again. Instead of setting out a plan to tackle the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis - he dodges scrutiny and defends the bungling Prime Minister. “When the Vanishing Chancellor reappears, he has a choice. He can continue his inaction and clobber our communities with tax rises and surging energy bills. It comes as Mr Johnson was battling to save his premiership in a move supposedly dubbed Operation Save Big Dog by his allies. But his authority has been badly damaged by the slew of revelations about rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, with No  forced to apologise to the Queen last week for the news of two dos on the eve of Prince Phillipaposs funeral.Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said that ministers would be expected to resignthey intentionally misled Parliament but dismissed the idea the PM had done so.Mr Raab told Times Radio: The suggestion that he lied is nonsense. Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons that questions on this... that he thought it was a work event. Pressed on what would be expectedMr Johnson had lied to the Commons, he told Today: If itaposs lying, deliberate in the way you describe,itaposs not corrected immediately, it would normally under the ministerial code and the governance around Parliament be a resigning matter. Mr Raab also described the event in question as a party before rowing back on the remark.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

Bev Rimes and Hayley Russell, both , first became pals when they worked together at the same nursery and bonded over their shared love of Take That. As they became closer, Hayley confided in mum-of-three Bev about her fertility struggles after the heartbreak of losing two babies.After finding out she was pregnant with hubby Jasonaposs baby in , Hayley tragically miscarried four weeks into her pregnancy.The following year she fell pregnant again, but lost the baby at  weeks.

It made us a lot closer and I wanted to support her as much as I could. Then, one afternoon in June  while having afternoon tea with her bestie, Hayley mentioned she felt too unwell to have a glass of champagne.Bev joked she could be pregnant - leading Hayley to pop out and buy a pregnancy test. Coincidentally, Bev started to feel a bit under the weather too.Each of the women took a test on the same day - and both had a positive result.  Over the moon at her wonderful news, Hayley caught her girlfriends up on the same group chat that Bev was in. When I saw her announcement, I was over the moon. I cried more seeing her pregnancy test than I did seeing my own. I was just amazed for her. I just couldnapost stop crying, it was so emotional. And when the pair discovered they both had a due date of  February, they were even more excited. After experiencing each stage of their pregnancy together, their tandem journey towards motherhood stepped up a gear when the pair both went into labour on the same night - a month before their due date. At am on  January , Bev and Hayley found themselves in adjoining hospital cubicles after each of their waters broke. Bev said: I remember hearing Hayleyaposs voice in the next cubicle at the hospital and I just couldnapost believe it. We had the same due date, then our waters broke four weeks early at the same time. Even the midwives said theyaposd not seen anything like this happen before! But the deliveries werenapost all smooth sailing and Hayley had a tense moment when her babyaposs heartbeat began to drop.  For Bev, the turmoil of knowing something was wrong with her best friend in the next cubicle was too much to bear. My best friend was next to me, I could hear the heartbeat and I couldnapost do anything to help her - it was horric, she recalled. Luckily, the moment passed and, after several years of heartbreak Hayleyaposs healthy baby boy Henry was born via c-section later that day weighing lbs oz. When I saw Hayley with this healthy baby, I was so grateful to have my baby, but to see her was just incredible, Bev said. It was one of the best moments in my le. It was a once in a million moment. You can never imagine anything like that happening. Bevaposs daughter Lilly arrived shortly before Henry, weighing lbs oz and the best friends were over the moon their little ones shared a birthday.The pairaposs friendship was strengthened even further when little Lilly battled sepsis at just three months old and Hayley supported Bev throughout.Since Lilly and Henry were born, the women have raised the pair like twins - with Lilly showing sassy and confident qualities like her mum, while Henry is the quieter of the two.

Sayu Sinha, , and his we Sharon have transformed their home in Ealing, London in a aposback-to-brickapos renovation. The stunning conversion saw the house updated from s décor but ensured they reinstated the key period features. The pair moved from Notting Hill to accommodate their growing needs as a family, according to Sayu who is a commercial property investor. He said they wanted to find a detached house with a large garden and just a  minute commute.That was the equivalent of buying a £ million house in Cha, in St. Johnaposs Wood, in Little Venice, he told My London.  But in Ealing, it cost me probably about a third of that but it gives me the same commuting time. They bought the , square foot property in September  and started work in January  once planning permission had been obtained. The first lockdown presented challenges for the couple to tackle but after seven months, they moved in. Stripping the house back to its bricks gave them an opportunity to craft their perfect family home. Sayu said: It gave us a real blank canvas to make our own mark - we loved it. The idea was that when you walk in, you get all the beautul kind of classic period features that the Edwardian houses kind of afford you around here and as you progress through the house towards the rearwe kept that relatively modern and contemporary by introducing the cripple doors. Designed by Tom Harley, the classic kitchen is what Sayu calls the marriage point of the two styles and is his favourite part of the whole renovation. He said preservation of the character of the house was key. Covid forced the project into turmoil when the supply chain came to a grinding halt. Sayu and Sharon both tried to do some work on the site without the help of workers which he called: an absolute disaster. The pair decided that the situation would fix itself within months and so remained positive, We kind of took an optimistic lens out of a box and said that this problem will sort itself out in three, six, or nine months, whatever that timeframe might be, he said. But it gives us a great opportunity to kind of just plan for the tail end of the project: the floors, the lighting, the kind of electrical, the furniture. And so they turned to Pinterest, scrawling through design inspiration while they waited for deliveries which they were told could take three times longer than usual and battled with the fact that material costs had increased by  per cent. Once the workforce were allowed back on site, the challenge became adapting working environments to suit the restrictions which meant only two workers were allowed in the same room. Now, Sayu looks upon that period with a fresh perspective. He said: The good thing was, once you kind of go through that process, youaposre kind of unfazed by some of the smallest things which which may not go to your liking.  Sayu would encourage anyone that is able to attempt a renovation of this scale in the future and he has given his top tips which have now carried him through two back-to-brick renovations. He credits thorough planning, prioritising and having experienced people around you as some of the key things that helped the build. Definitely plan well ahead. Itaposs never an enjoyable process when youaposre put under pressure, he said. Experience always helps. And having a good project manager or build team is equally important. Things that donapost need to be done in the near futurewhile weaposve got the supply side issues, maybe wait until you have some kind ofof normality.Sayu and Sharon have set up an Instagram account to document their renovation journey called @that_ealing_feeling.The page has brought more benefits than just simply as a way to monitor their progress though. Sayu said they have found a community of like-minded people who he can turn to. He explained: What really helped us through, especially through the COVID time when nobody really knew what was going on, was this community and everybody encouraging each other, that we would get through this and be half sane at the end of this process. That kept us going. It was an incredible way to kind of capture ideas, create new friends, and then kind of leverage that community for anything, you know, be it mental health ideas, or kind of optimism.

Mum Alicia McHale told how her son Donnan wanted to make money for the presents and she suggested he earn cash by doing errands around the family house in Gorton, reported the Manchester Evening News.But apparently not excited by the prospect of washing dishes or vacuuming the stairs, nine-year-old Donnan had another plan.He started to buy air fresheners from a pound shop then sell them outside a Tesco petrol station around the corner from his house.A packet of four cost one pound and entrepreneurial Donnan sold each for the same price.  The youngster proved to be a natural salesman and in only four weeks heaposd earned enough to buy a coat, phone, bike and tracksuit for presents. But unfortunately Donnanaposs business also brought police to the door. Mum Alicia said two officers arrived last Wednesday and asked to speak to Donnan following a aposcomplaintapos from his primary school Sacred Heart. I asked them what the problem was, said Alicia.  They just said aposweaposve had a phone call from the school, itaposs from Sacred Heart, could we come in a minute.apos They wanted to speak to Donnan and ask whataposs going on [with the air fresheners]. Alicia believes a member of staff at Sacred Heart spotted Donnan while visiting the petrol station and raised it with colleagues. She says another teacher then pulled Donnan out of class last week to quiz him. Iaposve no idea why, says Alicia. It should have been the headteacher, it should have been a discussion between us [his parents] and the headteacher. Alicia says she saw the member of staff the next day at the school gates and believed the matter was closed. [The teacher] didnapost tell me what had gone on, he didnapost tell me that he had rung police, she added.  Alicia said two police officers spoke briefly to Donnan and didnapost seem to have any concerns. Donnan explained... the officers were absolutely fine with it, she said. They said they would have to pass it on to the care team but they thought he was doing a great job.In a statement, Greater Manchester Police confirmed their officers were responding to a concern for the welfare of a child.However, Alicia also received a call from childrenaposs services about the incident. Manchester Council would not comment on the specics of the case but said childrenaposs services would always seek to ensure a child or young personaposs safety and welfare at all times. Alicia says sheaposs been left upset and embarrassed at how the incident was handled and does not think it needed to be referred to the authorities.

He was only doing it for an hour after school each night before he came home to get his tea, she said. Itaposs just round the corner. In a statement, Tesco confirmed staff at the store were aware of what Donnan was doing and made sure he was safe. A Tesco spokesperson said: “When our colleagues heard that Donnan wanted to raise some money to buy his little sister a Christmas present they were very touched and they made sure he was safe at our store. Suzanne Walker, Headteacher Sacred Heart Primary School, told the Manchester Evening News: We take the health and wellbeing of our pupils both in school and out very seriously and it is our duty to seek further advice and guidanceconcerns are raised with us about the welfare and safety of any of our pupils.

However, a recent study of a fossilised elasmosaurus - which is a type of plesiosaur - has revealed that these prehistoric creatures didnapost hold their heads that way. Instead, the elasmosaurus held its head below or level with its body, Dr Paul Scofield, a curator at Canterbury Museum in New Zealand has said.Does the Loch Ness Monster exist  Have your say in the comment section He said: The labyrinth of the ear works best when the tiny bones within are able to hang unaffected by gravity. For this reason, the position of the inner ear within the skull of an animal reveals a lot about how an animal habitually holds its head. We have examined the inner ear of elasmosaurs and determined that their resting position was with the head horizontal to the body or even well below the body.  This implies that they probably did not frequently hold their heads up high. The theory that Nessie is a living elasmosaurus was promoted by Denys Tucker, once a prominent zoologist at Londonaposs Natural History Museum. He was allegedly fired in  over his beliefs and later died in France in . However, new research is shedding light on the dference between the popular image of Nessie and what a real elasmosaurus looks like.  Dr Scofield said: The apostraditionalapos posture shown in many a popular article on Nessie - like a sock puppet - is not something elasmosaurs were in the habit of adopting. The idea of it lting its head up like a sock puppet is extremely unlikely. The scientist and his colleagues made their findings conducting a CT scan on the elasmosaurus remains and it is thought the prehistoric creature held its head down this way to feed from the seabed.  Dr Scofield said: They have these enormous teeth arranged in rows like a grappling iron. It has been hypothesised that they floated on the surface and dredged the seafloor blowing the dirt out through their teeth and leaving just the clams. Thus their feeding method dictates the neck- itaposs just like the giraffe but in reverse. This theory may explain to believers why Nessie is rarely seen with its head above water.  However, Dr Scofield is sceptical that Nessie exists and says itaposs further proof that the monster is a myth. He said: I totally reject the idea that Nessie exists and that it is an elasmosaurus. Loch Ness monster records are a mixture of fakes and mistakes. Dr Scofield and his colleagues published their study into the lasmosaurus in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.  The  surgeonaposs photograph is now widely believed to be a hoax that was created with a toy submarine and wood putty. Dr Scofield also highlighted that the scientic name for Nessie proposed by conservationist Sir Peter Scott, Nessiteras rhombopteryx, is an anagram of Monster hoax by Sir Peter S.

Prince Harry has applied for a judicial review of a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection for himself and his family when they are in the UK, a legal representative has said.Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex have written a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office. It reveals that they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided by the UK, when he and his family visit. What the Sussexes are looking for is full  hour protection from the police when they visit the UK - which is normally only given to royals or government officials.  Royal biographer Phil Dampier feels that this is a “very good excuse” for Meghan not toto the UK.Mr Dampier told The Sun : I donapost think Meghan will ever come back to this country and I think this is a very good excuse for not coming back - I donapost think realisticallyexpects to win this case.After stepping away from the Royal Family, Harry is now in effect a private citizen and it is claimed thathe was to receive protection then any high profile figure could also claim it.  But Mr Dampier continued: Getting his protection reinstated would set a precedent and so it gives them the perfect opportunity to say we can’t come to platinum jubilee celebrations. Harry might come over but it gives Meghan a good excuse not to come and also not to bring the children. This would also mean that the Queen would never get the chance to meet great granddaughter Lilibet and she only met Archie on a couple of occasions.  A legal representative for the Duke of Sussex said: Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.

Roman, now two years old, also suffers from brain damage, epilepsy and is fed through a tube, Chronicle Live reports.His heartbroken mum said a do not resuscitateorder was put in place during his most recent hospital stay. Lucy said: I feel like I live on eggshells every day because I just donapost know whataposs going to happen to Roman each day. Our lives just arenapost the same anymore and it never will be the same because heaposs never going to get better. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe mum-of-three, from Gateshead, said: Sepsis has changed all of our lives, not just Romanaposs, but the whole familyaposs. Roman was diagnosed with sepsis on October , , which was also his eldest brotheraposs th birthday. Lucy and dad Richard had taken Roman to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Gateshead, with what she believed was colic. But doctors rushed Roman to intensive care after diagnosing the youngster with sepsis and he remained on le support for three weeks. Lucy said: When we got to the hospital they took one look at him and rushed him to resus. He was fragile and floppy and the sepsis had impacted his brain. Within minutes my le was turned upside down.  Roman was able to spend Christmas  at home with his family after being discharged from Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary on December .But on Boxing Day the family received a shock when Roman tested positive for Covid, which he thankfully managed to fight.Lucy said: I donapost know where Roman gets the strength from, heaposs just so bubbly. He tries to babble on and heaposs such a happy baby. But when heaposs poorly he gets sick very quickly. I look at him and I canapost even explain how he makes me feel. I just try to cherish every day with him and try to give him the best that we can and spend as much happy time as I can with him. Lucy said she knew nothing about sepsis before her sonaposs diagnosis and hopes her story can raise awareness of the infection, which can be dficult to detect in people. Sepsis is a le-threatening reaction to an infection that happens when the immune system overreacts to an infection and starts to damage the bodyaposs tissues and organs.Symptoms can be dficult to spot as there are lots of possible symptoms which can be vague.More information about sepsis can be found on the NHS website or the Sepsis Trust charity website.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Babies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Courtney McAulfe was on a trip to the town of Skegness, in Lincolnshire, with her family when she stopped by a tattoo shop at the markets. Liking the idea of a bit of ink, she decided to get a tattoo of her son’s name. But posting on social media about her experience at the shop, she said “you get what you pay for”. The mum went on to reveal her tattoo, which is inked in calligraphy underneath her arm and displays the name Rueben.According to Daily Star reports, she further explained that the tattoo artist carried out her request, but in rather wobbly writing.I like the font I wanted it to – handwritten – but heaposs not done it very well, she said.  It could have been so much neater but what can you expect from Skegness. “My partner got the exact same tattoo by the same person and his one is so much better than mine. I donapost regret it but Iaposd never do it again. Honestly, I think my one-year-old could do better. Some viewers cracked up when they noticed Courtney had her tattoo done in Skegness. One joked: Are you even Britishyou donapost have a s*** Skeg tattoo. I have four, two of which got covered up. I got some dodgy tattoos in Skegness... must just be Skeggy, a second wrote. A viewer, who claims to be from Skegness, responded: Thataposs my home town. I have many a bad tattoo from when I was underage. I learned my lesson.

Vet practices in the region shared warnings on Facebook, urging owners to avoid beaches in Scarborough and Saltburn.But it would appear the bug is now moving inland as Brits in towns and cities, including Hebden Bridge, York, and Sheffield, reported similar symptoms. One person posted on a group in Hebden Bridge saying: The dog sickness bug is spreading here like wildfire. My dog came down it on Thursday and I had only taken her to school and back!  The vet said every other dog he has seen has this bug. She said that her dog was fine now but that her motheraposs dog had now come down with the same illness. She said: Just be careful as they donapost know what the cause is or how itaposs spreading. Another person from Sheffield posted saying that there was a nasty bug doing the rounds that will knock your dog off its feet. They added that the virus is spreading like wildfire and is in most areas and had caused her dog to vomit and have diarrhoea, which were similar symptoms to the virus reported from the coast. Emily Storey, from York, warned others about the illness - which she said was taking longer than normal to recover from - after her six-month old cockapoo Loki became ill last week.  She said that she had taken him on walks around Copmanthorpe and discovered that other dogs in the area had fallen ill with a similar illness. She said that he was also vomiting and had diarrhoea and that he was not eating properly. She also said that when she took him to the vets she was told that it seems to be worse than usual. In Leeds, a woman was walking her dog at Hunslet canal before it also caught the mystery illness. She said she thinks the virus came from the coast but is now being spread from dog to dog in the city. But one of the vets at the Minster Veterinary Practice played down the idea that a new illness was affecting canines though, saying that she didnapost think there was a new illness in York. She said: We often unfortunately get waves of unwell pets with vomiting and diarrhoea around this time of year, just as in the summer we often get cases of kennel cough. I did mention to a client at Willow Grove that I had seen a few cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, but this can be a normal occurrence this time of year. Any cases that have had to be hospitalised due to vomiting and diarrhoea have responded to supportive care. My main advice to any pet owners would be thatyour pet is unwell then seek veterinary attention,we have a mild stomach upset then a bland diet is little and often is a good idea. Please be reassured thatwe felt that there was something pet owners should avoid or minimise to stop their pet becoming generally unwell then we would advise of this.

The identity of the photo takeraposs thumb has never been revealed and remains unidentied.It comes as Andrew was said to have been left in tears when his mum stripped him of his honorary military titles after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Ms Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenuously denies any wrongdoing. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.He was said to be utterly devastated by Her Majestyaposs bombshell decision.It came just a fortnight after the Sunday People exclusively revealed the Queen would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign.A senior defence source said: “The Prince was tearful when told the news even though he had expected it. He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.” Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed.  “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He is also expected to cover his own legal costs for the civil case. He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London.  Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the Dukeaposs associate Jeffrey Epstein, a conviced paedophile and billionaire.The Duke of York has always denied the allegations and tried to explain his links with Epstein by doing an interview with BBC Newsnight where he claimed he has no recollection of ever meeting Ms Gufre. She alleges that the photo was taken at Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia, central London after a night out at Tramp nightclub in Mayfair. She claims that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions. In a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview in , the Duke denied those claims. He insisted that an alleged encounter in  did not happen because he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey. A source close to Ms Giuffre’s legal team has now claimed she is determined to “ruin him” because of his “arrogant” behaviour. “No one can believe how badly Andrew and his legal team have messed up. His arrogance is what has destroyed him,” they said. “It is Virginiaaposs firm belief that Andrew should go to jail for what heaposs done but in the end leaving him broke and destroyed may be enough. He is already destroyed.  “Now itaposs a matter of how much money he offers [in a settlement] and how broke we leave him.” Andrew has not been arrested or charged in respect of any criminal offence and has always strenuously denied the claims.

The Duke of York, , would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted at Buckingham Palace, ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile.A handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed.  The instructions were laminated and titled “DOY bed: Points for turn down  making the bed”, with Andrew keeping the accompanying sketch close to his bed while staying at the Palace. Staff wrote: “When the DOY is staying overnight, place one small teddy  cushion in the turn down. “When making the bed, place the teddy  cushion next to the teddy on the left- hand side with the necklaces on.”  Underneath in capital letters, it stressed: “Do not loosethe teddy  cushion!!” The sketch showed a teddy holding a heart had to be put on the left of the headboard and a grey hippo on the right, while the panther was halfway down. A second hippo was to be put on a green throw at the end of the bed. A source told The Sun: “It’s hilarious a Prince of England would want his teddies on his bed. You can imagine him crying, ‘Mummy, they haven’t put the hippos on my bed!’ to the Queenanyone got it wrong.Maybe they were presents from his daughters or Fergie, but it’s still strange.” Page worked in Royalty and Specialist Protection Command between  and  and had access to the princeaposs private quarters.In this apartment, the Duke had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims.He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile - is being aired on ITV on Tuesday at pm. ITV says host Ranvir Singh will unravel the story of how Maxwell sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And will also explore how Andrew became embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him. A representative for the Duke declined to comment on the remarks about soft toys.

The Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June.What do you make of our exclusive story  Have your say in the comment section Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months.

One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime there has been a series of good natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much looks forward to.” In the calls Charles, , has made it clear to his son of his wish to spend quality time with two-year-old Archie and seven-month-old baby Lilibet. Harry’s relationship with his family is understood to have been fractured following his exit from The Firm in , and subsequent decision last year to appear with Meghan, , in a tell-all interview with US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey. The couple beamoned their treatment by the family, with Harry accusing his father of cutting him off financially and further claiming a senior member of the family made racist remarks about the colour of his unborn children’s skin. Sources close to Charles have told The Mirror that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship.  One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Harry and Meghan, now live in an £million mansion in the millionaires’ playground of Montecito, Calornia, have not spent any time out of the United States since their move in . Harry is however also expected to attend the Invictus Games, which he founded, in The Hague, the Netherlands, in April.Since their exit from the family they have signed deals worth an estimated £million with streaming giants Netflix and Spoty, with the capability to earn hundreds of millions of dollars having become “financially independent”.Clarence House did not comment.

The heart-stopping moment came after the princeaposs protection officer Ken Wharfe allowed Harry to play with his radio as he was fascinated by police equipment.  Ken said he then invented a game of giving Harry little missions by telling him to go to specic locations around Kensington Palace, where he lived, and checking in on the radio.The former protection officer told the Daily Mail : He was thrilled, especially when I directed him to go out of the palace entrance to the stable block to visit his aunt, Lady Jane [Dianaaposs sister]. The block was monitored by CCTV, so this seemed safe.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. He explained that Harry called when he reached his auntaposs place so Ken summoned the boy back. But minutes later, the young royal then radioed to say he left palace confines altogether and was at a shop on Kensington High Street.And Ken added: What shoppers must have thought to see the Queenaposs grandson walking down the busy street clutching a police radio, I have no idea. I ordered him to come back, and ran to meet him, but I knew weaposd been on the verge of a security disaster. The Met would have taken a very dim view, but thataposs nothing compared to what the Princess [Diana] would have said. Luckily, she never found out.Earlier this week, Harry released a statement saying he is unable to bring we Meghan Markle and their two children Archie and Lilibet to the UK due to a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK.He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland, but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years.

He initially was suffering just from a headache, but just days later he was rushed to hospital by his we, Lia, after he was left unable to breathe. Dad-of-two Scot, who was unvaccinated, was told there was a four-hour wait in AE, to which he replied: Iaposll be dead in three hours. Scot spent eight weeks in hospital, where his we was delivered the devastating news that he wouldnapost survive. But Scot has now made a miraculous recovery, despite losing five stone as he battled the virus. Speaking toBlackCountryLive , Scot said he is “not an anti-vaxxer by any stretch of the imagination” but rather bought into some conspiracies he read online.My choice at the time was to wait to have it,” he continued. “A lot of my friends have now had the jab on the back of me being ill and Iaposve had my first jab now. I was never ill, so when people saw how poorly I was I think it hit home. If anything good has come out of all of this, then itaposs that. The Wolverhampton dad said his illness started with a general feeling of being run down, as well as a headache. I did a lateral flow test which came back as positive. I spent the next week at home and had to call an ambulance out twice. I was sweating and just felt awful - but it got worse and worse,” he said. After seeing that her husband was struggling to breathe, Scotaposs -year-old we raced him to New Cross Hospital. A nurse checked my saturation levels twice and looked puzzled. She was amazed that I was still conscious,” he said. Scot, who owns Grfiths and Daughters UPVC and Glazing Specialists, was taken to resus. He spent three days in the respiratory ward where he was treated with antibiotics and oxygen. When his condition did not improve, Scot was moved to intensive care where he stayed for five weeks. After just over a week, he was on a ventilator, in an attempt to let his body rest. I nearly died three times,” Scot said. “One time in particular it was very touch-and-go. The consultant phoned my we and said that I wouldnapost survive and she needed to come to hospital immediately. After a change of antibiotics, Scotaposs condition thankfully began to improve. However, he still had to be put into an induced coma for three weeks and required a tracheotomy before he was taken off the ventilator completely.  When he woke from the coma, he had lost five stone and couldn’t write or talk, an experience he compared to being “locked in” his own body. Scot went back on to the ward and was then transferred to a physio centre for six days as he had a large amount of muscle wastage He said: I couldnapost walk after being in bed for ten weeks. I wasted away to nothing, Iaposm a football coach so am used to being busy but physically it was really hard. Scot has attributed parts of his recovery to massages from EC Therapy in Wolverhampton, which he says have aided his muscles as he regains his strength. He added: I have gone from strength to strength and feel like Iaposm about  per cent well. Iaposm one of the lucky ones and have come out relatively unscathed physically. I had Covid pneumonia and had an infection too, but I have no scarring on my lungs. I am a strong person, which carried me through. I saw people die in ICU and heard the defibrillator go off multiple times a night. Once the battle is over with health, then you start to have a think about what youaposve been through. Me and my we talk for hours about it but I struggle with survivors guilt. Anyone who has been through it and says they came out unscathed is lying. Scotaposs young daughters Francesca, , and Izabella, six, were unable to see him during his time in hospital, apart from a couple of video calls when he was well enough. “Iaposve been out of hospital now for about  weeks and theyaposre only just now starting to believe that I wonapost get unwell and leave again,” Scot said. Scot has been left with aposbrain fogapos after his Covid battle, but says that he is grateful to be on the mend. He has now had his first vaccine dose and is encouraging others to do the same. You get a new perspective on le - there will be a lot more holidays for my family this year! he said Scot continued: A massive thank you goes out to all the staff - from cleaners, cooks, nurses and consultants at New Cross because they have been amazing. They are doing a very dficult job and are run so thinly. They donapost get paid enough for what they do. At least one person was at my bedside hrs a day keeping me alive - without that, I wouldnapost be here. They are only human and are all doing a fantastic job - I will be eternally grateful.

Em J, now , was  stone at her heaviest and says she was dependent on sugary drinks and late-night takeaways.It wasnapost until her mum confronted her about her health that Em decided to make a change, LiverpoolECHO reports. The waitress said: When I look at pictures of me at  stone it really is frightening. I was suffering severe depression, anxiety and I was so dependent on full-fat, sugary drinks. I was ordering takeaways at  or  o’clock in the morning and that’s when I really started to gain weight. I was only , but physically I felt like I was in my s. I was suffering severe dizzy spells, to the point in time where I didn’t leave my house for six months due to the repercussions of the dizziness, and I was having palpitations, shortness of breath and chronic fatigue. I also struggle with dyspraxia and agoraphobia on top of that, which made le feel unbearable at times.” Em has lost eight stone just  months after cutting out fizzy drinks by finding sugar-free alternatives to curb her cravings. She even appeared on Channel  ’s ‘Lose Weight Like Me’ to inspire the nation as a ‘Weight Loss Hero’.The content created said: “What saved my le was transitioning to a low-sugar lestyle. With the help of The Skinny Food Co’s products, I discovered alternatives that were low in calories and sugar but still felt like a treat as they tasted just as good.  I’m also so happy I’ve been able to find alternatives to the sugary drinks I used to be addicted to. I’m a big cocktail lover and working as a barmaid, I know how dficult it is to find low-sugar, low-calorie alcoholic drinks that are delicious too. Sharing a few unique tricks and mindset shts towards food that made the healthy diet stick, Em J said: Once I started eating healthier, I realised that my addiction was mostly in my head.  Simple tricks such as pretending The Skinny Food Co’s Skinny Malts were the real deal or putting a Skinny Food Fakeaway into the takeaway boxes I used to order still made the food feel like a treat.” Em has also started walking at least two miles every day to get herself outside. She said: The combination of eating healthier and moving my body really helped regenerate my health.  It was about changing habits slowly and in a way that wasn’t too overwhelming. The Skinny Food Co was a big motivation by allowing me to enjoy the pleasure of treats, but in a healthy way. It felt like a win, win! My advice is to understand that you’re human. We all have setbacks and there is no quick fix to overcoming them. It’s about discovering what works for you and making small adaptations at first, then the progress will follow.

Tell me, what is the monkey doing , the operator asks as Travisaposs harrowing, almost gleeful, wails and screeches echo down the line. He ripped her apart! Hurry up! Hurry up! Please!” Herold breathlessly replies. “He—he ripped her face off! Heaposs eating her face! “Gun! They got to shoot him! Please! Please! Hurry! Hurry! Please! I can’t. I can’t … He’s eating her! He’s eating her! Please! God! Please! Where are they  Where are they ” Officers did come and Travis was killed. Astonishingly, his victim, Charla Nash, survived, but you could argue that in many ways, her le too came to an abrupt end that day.  Charla, a friend of Travisapos aposmomapos Sandra, had been asked to pop over to help put the pampered ape in his enclosure - but, uncharacteristically, he snapped, attacking her and gnawing off her face and hands. In a show of terrying primal strength, Travis ripped off her eyelids and tore off her nose. He scalped her, gouged out and ate her eyes, chewed off one of her hands entirely and almost tore one of her arms off. Her jaw was entirely dislocated from her skull and she was left with brain damage. It is still not known why Travis - a local celebrity who would eat lobster in restaurants, had a pet cat, and loved driving around on a lawnmower - flipped out the way that he did that day.  Sandra later admitted giving him a dose of strong anti-anxiety medicine Xanax in his daily cup of tea earlier that day when she noticed that he was aposagitatedapos. She also claimed that he behaved viciously because Charla was wearing her hair dferently. But it could also have been that at the age of , the lbapeaposs instincts had simply become too strong - or that he was simply sick of his unnatural lestlye of cooking his own microwave meals, drinking wine at dinner, and using the toilet like a human. Sandra had owned Travis since he was just three days old, paying a breeder , for the infant chimp.  His mum was shot with a tranquiliser dart so that he could be stolen away - and from that moment on, he was no longer a chimpanzee, but Sandraaposs apossonapos. To outsiders they had an unbreakable bond, and even shared a bed after Sandraaposs husband died. After the attack on February , , the then -year-old told reporters: He couldnapost be more my son thanI gave birth to him. But everything has a breaking point, and for Sandra, that came when she saw her beloved aposlittle boyapos mauling her best friend.  Due to Charlaaposs horric injuries, Sandra was the only person able to explain exactly what had prompted the attack. She claimed Travis approached Charla aggressively before getting onto his hind legs and launching the savage attack, throwing her against the side of her car before gorging on her face and hands. Desperate, Sandra stabbed him in the back with a carving kne and battered him over the head with a shovel in a bid to make him stop, which it did for a moment. She recalled how he turned around and looked at her, before she ran for her le and locked herself in her car.  Sandra said: “I grabbed the shovel and hit him with the shovel to stop it. It wasnapost working, so I went and I had to get a kne — and I stabbed him. I had to. He looked at me like, ‘Mom, what did you do ’” When police arrived, Travis was in a frenzy of bloodlust. He opened one of their patrol caraposs doors and lunged at an officer. Despite being shot four times at point blank range Travis didnapost die. He ran back in to the house, and collapsed dead on his special bed, leaving a trail of blood behind him.  The gunshots are heard in the background of Sandraaposs breathless  call. When paramedics arrived on the scene they were unable to decipher the victimaposs gender due to the severity of the wounds. Like something from a horror film, strips of flesh and scalp had been flung around the yard of Sandraaposs Stamford, Connecticut, home. They assumed that Charla, who was a mass of bloodied flesh with no recognisable facial features slumped in a pool of her own blood, was dead - until she moved. They sprung into action, and managed to save her le.  The brutal attack had caused her to lose half of her blood and she would later undergo a face transplant. Sadly, a pioneering hand transplant was rejected by her body. After the incident, NBC reporter Jeff Rossen asked Sandra: “After what youaposve been through with this — your friend is in the hospital fighting for her le — do you still think chimps should be pets  She replied: “Would I have done it again  Yes! Theyaposre the closest thing to humans — to us. “We can give them a blood transfusion, and they can give us one. How many people go crazy and kill other people  This is one incident that I donapost know what happened. “It was a horrible thing. But Iaposm not a horrible person. And he wasnapost a horrible chimp. It was a freak thing.”  Fteen months later Sandy died from an aneurysm. She was buried with two urns beside her. One was her daughteraposs, the other belonged to Travis. The only survivor of that hideous day is Charla Nash, who now lives in darkness, wearing someone aposs face and entirely dependent on the staff at the care home where she will spend the rest of her days. Ahead of the face transplant she spoke to Oprah Winfrey, and rued the loss of the le she loved. She said: Iaposve never been a quitter. Unfortunately, thereaposs not a whole lot I can do. “I’ve lost so much independence. I could change my own truck tyre, and now I can’t even feed myself. Itaposs very hard to live. Not even live - half-live. “Sometimes you want to cry, you want out, you want some kind of home. I donapost know what my future is, thataposs the scary part.

Kacey Wheeler recently had a washing machine delivered from the electrical retailer and claims the delivery man couldnapost stop staring at her when doing the drop off in Bradford last week. The -year-old even called her fiance Ryan Sager shortly afterwards to joke the man, known only as Jordan, was in love with her, but they were both gobsmacked when he texted her  minutes later. What Jordan didnapost know, however, was that the mobile number on the order sheet actually belonged to Ryan - as the washing machine had been a gt from his parents. As soon as I opened the door I saw one of the guys just didnapost take his eyes off me. I didnapost take it in a weird way at first and I thought it was funny. He was just staring at me, Kacey said. The other guy just came in, dropped the washer and then left, but the other guy didnapost want to leave. He was lingering around telling me where to put it and opening draws. It was really creepy but at the time I just thought it was strange. I was winding Ryan up telling him the driver was in love with me, then I thought he was joking when he said heaposd got texts from him. I canapost believe he just took the number off the sheet and he knows where we live. Evenheaposd have come into my house and asked for my number it wouldnapost have been as weird.Not happy at the driveraposs advances, Ryan decided to embarrass Jordan by engaging in a flirty six-hour text exchange, which he later shared to Facebook.Posing as his six-months-pregnant fiancee, Ryan began chatting with Jordan who bragged about being a former prison bad boy and cheekily suggested they should meet up to get this washer sorted. In the six-hour chat Ryan, , even asked Jordan, who claimed to be chilling at Currys self-employed, to be his sugar daddy after he bragged about earning £, per year. Electrician Ryan believes he aposintimidatedapos the delivery worker with his late-night request of a threesome and description of naughty bedroom kinks - including a request he dress up as a Marvel superhero. When the Currys driver tried to continue the chat the next day, Ryan abruptly cut him off saying, f*** off now, Iaposm bored, before revealing Jordan had actually been talking to Kaceyaposs fiance for hours. Despite the light-hearted prank to waste Jordanaposs time, Ryan has been angered by the delivery manaposs cheek and Kacey now says sheaposs afraid to accept deliveries without her fiance in the house. Ryan said: Thereaposs my shoes in the house, Kaceyaposs six months pregnant and sheaposs got an engagement ring on. Itaposs just utter disrespect. When I got the phone call and the text came through I was annoyed, but then I thought Iaposd make a laugh out of it. I thought aposIaposm going to [pull] your legapos. My favourite bit was asking him to dress up in a Marvel costume and him replying that heaposs a prison boy. He was trying to big himself up. Itaposs embarrassing. He deserves to have the mick taken out of him. From the texts you can tell heaposs a very strange guy. I thought Iaposd scared him off on the night, talking about a threesome, but then when he messaged back the next day and I wasnapost having a good day at work so I just told him to f*** off. Iaposm happy heaposs wasted all that time. Every time I put something provocative, heaposd have been sitting there on his couch sweating, thinking aposwhat do I do with his girlapos. He thought heaposd pulled. If it was me Iaposd have felt tiny. I hope he feels like an idiot. If he came back to the house heaposd get it, but itaposs a shame for Kacey. You shouldnapost be made uncomfortable by delivery drivers like that. Currys said they were treating the matter aposvery seriouslyapos and confirmed they are currently investigating it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

They nicknamed their finding, which weighs twice as much as the average newborn, ‘Doug’. However, now, the New Zealand found spud will have to undergo DNA analysis to prove it’s a spud before it can claim its spot in the record books. This has left the couple dejected and feeling betrayed. Colin confirmed that they were requiring that a sample of Doug be sent to Scotland despite the experts, agronomists and field scientists the couple have had to very the find.  He said: “Do they think I genetically modied it  It’s been a rollercoaster of emotion. “While it’s extremely deflating, I want to prove them wrong. We will do everything they ask of us.” A bit of Doug will end up at Researchers at Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculturewho provide agricultural advice to the Scottish government.  They will genotype Doug to confirm he is a potato and possibly what iety he is too. The Guinness World Records confirmed they were in touch with the biology department but Sasa has not yet received the bit of Doug. The couple described the potato as their “happy little mistake of nature” they came across when the hoe struck something large. Speaking to Stuff, Colin said: “It’s a hideous looking creature. “It’s the sort of thing that only a mother could love.” The couple think the potato is self-sown and could have been growing for a couple of years or more.  Whilst they await confirmation to seeDoug will take his place in the annals of history, they have built a small cart to tow the potato around town and show it off. However, Colin is concerned about how long the potato will last for as it has already started to lose weight as it dries out and turns mouldy. To ensure some preservation he has stored it in a freezer. The current heaviest potato was found in Britain in  and weight only just under kg, far less than Doug.

A huge cloud of black ash that has settled on Tonga is hampering rescue efforts as have downed communications with outlying islands. The region has suffered major damage from the volcanic eruption and tsunami, said the United Nations. Tonga police have said the death toll stands at two but with communications in the South Pacic island nation cut, it is dficult to have a clear figure. Tongaaposs main airport, Fuaaposamotu International Airport, was not damaged in Saturdayaposs eruption and tsunami but heavy ashfall is preventing full operations, hampering international relief efforts. The priority now will to be get supplies to Tonga, and the biggest constraint on that at the moment ... is the airport. There is still a signicant amount of ash, Australiaaposs Minister for the Pacic Zed Seselja said.  Tongan officials were planning to evacuate people from outer islands where conditions were very tough, we understand, with many houses being destroyed in the tsunami, Seselja said. The UN said a distress signal was detected in an isolated, low-lying Haaposapai islands group, adding it had particular concerns about Fonoi and Mango islands. According to the Tonga government,  people live on Mango and  on Fonoi.  The Tongan navy reported major damage in the Haaposapai islands which were hit by waves estimated to be - metres high, said the UN. Surveillance images taken by the New Zealand defence force and circulated on social media in Tonga showed catastrophic damage to the outlying island of Atata. The islands of Fonoua, Niniva, Nomuka and Mango all had damage ranging from extensive to catastrophic, with an entire village destroyed on Mango.  Tonga is a kingdom of  islands, of which  are inhabited, with a population of , people.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haaposapai volcano, which sits on the seismically active Pacic Ring of Fire, is about  miles north of Tongaaposs capital. The eruption sent tsunami waves across the Pacic Ocean and was heard , miles away in New Zealand.  The South Pacic archipelago had its main undersea communications cable cut by the impact of the eruption hampering rescue efforts as a thick layer of ash blankets the islands, the New Zealand High Commission said. It added it was working to establish communications with smaller islands as a matter of priority. One victim was Brit Angela Glover, , who was killed in the tsunami as she tried to rescue dogs she looked after at a rescue shelter, her brother said, the first known death in the disaster.  We donapost have any further information that would suggest ... signicant casualties, Seselja told the Australian broadcaster Nineaposs Today show. The airport was likely to be open by Wednesday, he said. Tongaaposs deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tuaposihalangingie, said Tonga was worried that aid deliveries could spread Covid to the virus free nation.We donapost want to bring in another wave - a tsunami of Covid-, Tuaposihalangingie said, urging the public to wait for a disaster relief fund to donate.Any aid sent to Tonga would need to be quarantined, and it was likely no foreign personnel would be allowed to disembark aircraft, he said.The Red Cross said it was mobilising its network to respond to what it called the worst volcanic eruption the Pacic hasexperienced in decades.Alexander Matheou, the Red Crossapos Asia Pacic director, said water purication to remove ash contamination, providingshelter and reuniting families were the priorities.Further volcanic activity cannot be ruled out, said the UNaposs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The impact of the huge eruption was felt as far away as the United States. Two people drowned off a beach in Peru due to high waves caused by the tsunami, while officials in Japan reported several evacuations. The island of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai all but disappeared following the blast, according to satellite images taken about  hours later, making it dficult for volcanologists to monitor activity. Experts said the volcano, which last erupted in , had been puffing away for about a month before Saturdayaposs eruption.

Sadly for the teacher, donating an organ to his mother-in-law wasnapost enough to rescue his relationship, which ended less than a month after the operation. To add insult to injury, Uzielaposs ex has since married another man.

He said: Actually I’m fine, I’m fine emotionally, I think so is she. I have nothing against her, we are on good terms. We are not friends, but neither do we hate each other. I only did it to make a TikTok. I didn’t think this was going to get out of control. One viewer urged Uziel not to repeat the mistake, but the TikToker joked that he has no spare kidneys left to donate. We just have two kidneys andI already gave one, I only have another one for me, so … I can’t feel it, he said. Uziel posted his original TikTok in response to a trend in which men recounted their worst experiences with exes.

Regrettably, the principle of development is not considered acceptable in this location.”.removeIt adds: “The planning authority understands the applicant’s circumstances and need to find alternative, fit for purpose family accommodation that meets their very specic needs.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances. In pure planning terms I’ve heard what has been said and normally you wouldn’t take certain things into consideration.“I don’t often disagree with the planning officers [but] I would quite happily approve this in principle because it’s the right thing to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kelso-shoplifting-offence-man-33-sentence-deferred","story":"A -year-old man has admitted a charge of theft by shoplting at Selkirk Sherf Court.Daniel Hamilton gave an address in Kelso.Sentence was deferred until the outcome of his trial on June  for a charge of possession of a bladed article in a public place."},{"url":null,"title":"scott-praises-efforts-departing-boss-hastings","story":"MARTIN ‘Jimmy’ Scott says he is \"honoured and excited\" to take over as manager of Gala Fairydean Rovers.The former Ross County and Hibs player joined Rovers last summer as assistant to Neil Hastings, who has left the club for a full-time position.Scott has appointed former Aberdeen player Steven Craig as his number two and he will join the club this week.Speaking following his appointment the new gaffer said: “I’m honoured and excited to be appointed manager of the club and I am really looking forward to getting started this week.“It will be a smooth transition for me, and this is credit to the players, staff and everyone who’s involved in the operation of the club.“I’ve worked very closely with Neil over the last six months and ultimately the philosophy will remain the same in how we want to approach the game although I will always keep putting the demands on the players to improve on the good work already done.“I have added Steven Craig to assist with first team operations and to attract someone of Stevie’s pedigree shows what a fantastic club we have here and he’s very excited to start working with myself, staff and the squad.“On a personal note, I’m absolutely delighted for Neil moving to a full-time position in football.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"horrendous-ugly-fencing-gets-go-ahead-school","story":"Haddington’s community council had reacted angrily to proposals for metal fencing, measuring . metres in

This town beach has plenty of cafes at which to get a warming coffee afterwards too, and also the Green Van, which often has snaking queues of swimmers trailing up to it.

It’s also where we met the incredible Jacky Morrison-Hart,  now sadly lost to Covid, who had only  percent vision and was enabled to swim there by her we, Jane, and friends. Local swimmer Barry McGowan advises, “Post swim cakes at the Cabin Cafe, which also has toilet facilities, close to the water’s edge at the middle paying carpark.” Aberdeen BeachAberdeen has an incredible beach nearly two miles long, but it’s the Footdeebeach, which backs onto the old fishing village, which really draws a swimming community. Local Kieran Moroney writes, “The little cottages and outbuildings look like something out of a fairytale. If you get up early enough the sunrises coming up over the horizon can be magical and you are often greeted with dolphins”. Highly recommended for post-swim refreshments is the Roots vegan food truck on the beach. Loch Morlich, The CairngormsWhere the Cairngorm Wild Swimmers meet every Sunday, this loch even has its own sandy beach and plenty of parking. Even in the deaths of winter, with snow swirling around, we have found hardcore groups of swimmers down there. Local swimmer Alison Freshwater writes, “Loch Morlich lies in the shadow of the majestic Cairngorms, with the ski resort rising directly up from the beautul Glenmore forest which surrounds it.,, Entry to the beach is over clean, soft sand. You could be forgiven for thinking you are in a seaside resort and not freshwater.”Subscribe now for the latest arts TV nostalgia features environmental news and opinion letters from just £ by clicking here The Art of Wild Swimming Scotland by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan is published by Black and White "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/ 13381943.jpg?type=article-full","title":"many-men-joining-wild-swimming-craze","story":"But then this is no ordinary swim group. This is the Edinburgh Blue Balls, a men’s mental health swim group.Among those taking part in that pre-swim “check-in” is actor Johnny Panchaud who recalls his very first such circle, vividly, ashe were still there.“We’re all standing on the sand, all these men of dferent shapes, sizes, ages. We’re all nervous about swimming. And Marc, the founder of the group, just says, ‘We’re going to do a check-in today.’ Everyone was like, what the hell’s a check-in  Normally getting in the water is the scary part.“So we’re standing in a circle, and even that’s scary, men getting in a circle, and we start telling each other how we’re feeling and what we’re struggling with. And these words like anxiety, depression, fear, that people always experience but, especially, men never share, start coming out.”Edinburgh Blue Balls swimmer Johnny Panchaud,Marc MillarAlso in attendance at some of those early swim check-ins was keen rugby player John McMillan.“As we went round,” he says, “everyone was sharing their fears and anxieties and you could see that, as it progressed, people’s chests were getting bigger, almost getting strength from the group itself.“McMillan had found the group at a time of need, spotting it on Facebook in the run up to the fth anniversary of the day he tried to take his le.“Because I knew the anniversary was approaching,” he says, “things were building up. I knew either I was going to have a total breakdown or I needed to do something. Coming across this group was a huge weight off my shoulders. I was able to not bottle it up as much.”John McMillan,Marc MillarThe Instagram strapline for the Edinburgh Blue Balls is “weekly swim group to give men the chance to improve mental and physical health”.As the group has got bigger and the weather colder, they now no longer do a physical check-in before swimming and have replaced it with an online chat group. Issues discussed there include alcoholism, abusive relationships, attempted suicides, bereavement, depression, anxiety.Of course, long before men discovered group wild swimming and got the t-shirt , women were there.With my collaborator Anna Deacon, I’ve been writing books about wild swimming for some years now . At book events, people would sometimes ask us, why it was wild swimmers were mainly women  Why was it all blue tits and no blue balls But the pandemic has expanded the demographic coming to the water. With lockdowns and restrictions leaving many of us cooped up and isolated, more have been drawn to the great escape of getting into a cold sea.: The ice breakers. How Scotlands ice swimmers taught me to love the cold.The past couple of years have taken a toll on our collective mental health. Deaths from alcohol, in , were up almost  percent on the previous year and twice as many men as women died as a result of alcohol.Depression levels have doubled during the pandemic. It’s against this backdrop that an outdoor swimming for mental health trend has emerged.Particularly powerful has been the UK-wide Mental Health Swims movement founded by Rachel Ashe.Meanwhile, this new wave of men’s groups, swimming explicitly for mental health, has arrived with names like Edinburgh Blue Balls, the Sunrise Club, Blue Balls Cornwall, Ice Guys North East and Fe Dippers Mental Health Men’s Dip.It’s December  when I meet Marc Millar for a chat at Bross Bagels, which he runs with his partner in Portobello. The -year-old sports the same broad beard that lunges out of the logo created by a friend for the group’s social media. That graphic is also emblazoned across ious bits of entertaining group merchandise, including a hoodie, and their Edinburgh Blue Balls budgie smugglers. A set of blue balls, naturally, also feature in the entertainingly tongue-in-cheek image. Millar is himself a professional photographer, who has taken images accompanying this article.Edinburgh Blue Balls swimming at Wardie Bay,Anna DeaconHe describes how he had been following the Instagram account of Ice Guys North East, who swim from Roker Beach, Sunderland.When he askedthey might start a group in Edinburgh, their reply was to encourage him to set it up himself. “So I had a couple of bottles of wine one night and did it. Before I knew it ten people were coming the next day.”The group snowballed. “It’s a bunch of guys,” Marc says, “with absolutely nothing in common, all dferent ages, walks of le. Before a swim, everyone’s polite. But then you dip your balls in the water and you’ve got everything in common, everything. You feel so much empathy.”One of the main issues, he observes, for a lot of the members is anxiety. “Also abusive relationships. And a lot of the guys are open about how they’ve tried to commit suicide as well. ”What’s clear, from speaking to many other swimmers, is that Millar’s willingness to express his anxieties is part of its success. He’s not only leading them into the water, but into a particular way of talking about themselves.As Johnny Panchaud puts it, “He got everyone’s trust so quickly and I think that came through him being extremely transparent. For the first month he was saying, saying, ‘Guys I’m s***ing myself, I’m still terried before every single group.’ The leader of the group showing vulnerability has encouraged us to show vulnerability.”Edinburgh Blue Balls at Portobello beach,Marc MillarPanchaud shows his own vulnerability as he relates the journey that led him to being now -months sober.Back in October , he had hit a low, and whilst visiting his parent’s house when they were were away, he found himself alone with his own dark thoughts.“I’m not going to say that I was thinking about committing suicide, because I don’t think I would ever have had the bottle to see that through. But the thought had entered my mind for the first time: ‘How do I get out of this ”He called an old friend in London who flew up “at the drop of a hat” and after much soul-searching, he made a pledge to himself: he would stop drinking and taking recreational drugs. Five days later, he took up an offer from friends to go for a “wild water swim” at Portobello. In the run up he found himself genuinely losing sleep over the imminent dip.“But we did it. I must have been in and out in two minutes. But after that, I went religiously, every single day for one month.”In that early stage, he says, he was not “ready to look back at the trail of destruction I’d caused with my drinking and drugs”, or forward.“I felt I’ve got to find a way of staying sober today. And with wild swimming, you physically can’t think about anything other than now.”Amongst the group, he is not alone in his openness about dark times. David Nimmons, for instance, describes how prior to this he was driven to seek help from his doctor by his suicidal thoughts, and the attempted suicide of his brother.“My marriage had ended. I was trying to make sense of everything, including my brother’s attempted suicide. I had started speaking to a talking therapist through the NHS which helped massively but I needed something . I needed something to help me control it on my own terms.”A reason swimming appealed was, he says, because his brother had attempted suicide by jumping off rocks into a river.“For my brother, the idea was that this cold water was going to take him away. But for me the water gives me strength. No matter what day I’ve had, once I’m in the water with the guys it’s like le is beautul.”The circle,Anna DeaconIt’s hugely moving to hear these men’s stories, told with hearts on sleeves.Stuart Kennedy, for instance, describes the rollercoaster last few years of his le, in which his best friend died in a car accident, he split up with his we and began a long stint of living with parents and friends, during the pandemic and then, just as he had started to feel that le was getting back to normal, his ex-we was diagnosed with cervical cancer.That cancer, sadly, would take her le, and leave Kennedy supporting his two young sons through the loss of their mother.Then there’s Ryan Malone, who recalls,“Lockdown hit me pretty badly. But this has always been underlying. I’m . I’ve been speaking to a few people about why men in that age bracket are in such a bad state of mental health. For me, it was just a build up of anxiety and depression.“It built up to one Sunday in August, when my we was in London and I was on my own. I couldn’t breathe. I’d had anxiety and minor panic attacks before but with this I realised I needed to seek help. I went to the GP that Monday.”Ryan Malone,Marc MillarMalone mentions the mid-le crisis, which also something also broached by Mental Health Swims coach Salim Ahmed. The founder of SwimLab, Ahmed teaches swimming as an art, rather than competitive skill.Men are, he observes, becoming more aware that there are several stages to the ‘midle crisis’.“There’s the accelerated way in which your body starts to fail having to let go of your personal best and learning that you need to accept certain things are happening with your physiology.“Men are becoming aware of that. They’re starting to discover that just having a swim every couple of days is making them feel so much better. And then they find that they’re getting their mojo back. But they have to embrace the fact that they have to approach swimming in a dferent way. Not to win, but to live.”But is it even about swimming  It seems to me the male mental health swim trend is part of a wider men’s mental health movement that’s expressed in multiple ways.Marc Millar observes: “It’s not actually about swimming or dipping. It’s just a mutual thing where everyone is doing the same thing at the same time.”Edinburgh Blue Balls,Marc MillarIt’s January , . A large, woolly-hatted flock of around  men mill around the groyne that leads down to the water at Portobello beach and are are joined by visiting swimmers Jonathan Cowie, editor of Outdoor Swimmer magazine and, of all things, a woman, Gilly McArthur, sporting a fake beard.As the crowd moves towards the water, wading in what looks like some kind of communal baptism, there’s a flurry of grunts and out-breaths.But there are no signs of competition here – just what looks like pure, joyful swimming to live.Cowie and McArthur are here as part of a month of swims with men, their intention being “to expand out the message that cold water can be helpful and powerful for men as well as women.”:  Scottish wild swim spots with amazing communitiesEmerging from the water, McArthur, comments on how she felt a touch of intimidation going in with so many men. It’s the mirror to something Millar expresses.A resident of Portobello, he had watched groups of mainly women getting into the water there, and felt uncomfortable as a man with joining.“I never would see any guys. And it was weird because I’d see so many groups of women and so many solo guys swimming. Still to this day when you go down onto the beach there are women together and the guys are swimming alone.”That really seems to be the point. Men not swimming alone. But together.The Art Of Wild Swimming Scotland and Taking The Plunge, both by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan, are published by Black and White"},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-tories-arent-true-party-union---labour","story":"It was a throwaway comment, of course, but nonetheless wickedly accurate.Imagine, for a second, you are one of those in the -or-so per cent of the population who might be persuaded either way in the event of a second independence referendum.You are already statistically unlikely to think much of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The perception that his government’s behaviour during Covid has been the very definition of ‘one rule for them and another for the rest of us’ has reduced further your regard for him, and made you question whether the problem is wider than Mr Johnson. The Tories in general. Westminster in general. The call, by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, for Mr Johnson to resign validates your concern.Then enter Jacob Rees-Mogg. In dismissing Mr Ross as a ‘lightweight’ – the ultimate insult in politics – he was personally offensive. But the insult was laced with meaning. It was, accidentally or otherwise, a deep reveal about the DNA of the Conservative party right across the country. It is a party which is instinctively opposed to the decentralisation of power, whether that be within its own party structures, or within the Union it claims to hold so dear.Mr Rees-Mogg doesn’t regard Mr Ross as a lightweight because he knows him and has assessed his political abilities he regards him as a lightweight because he is a leader in a devolved Parliament. In Mr Rees Mogg’s world, remoteness from Westminster is inversely proportional to relevance. The Scottish Tories are irrelevant. The Scottish Parliament is irrelevant. Scotland is irrelevant.Mr Rees-Mogg is not a lone wolf. They were his words, but they echoed the instincts of the Tory heartlands throughout the south of England.All this from the party which has spent the last five elections, at Scottish and UK level, running the same single-issue campaign claiming to be the true defenders of the Union by opposing a second independence referendum under any circumstances. They have made a decent success of it, too, by working with the SNP to create a polarising narrative which benefits both parties. You either believe in independence, or you believe in the status quo. There is no space between.But there is a space between. It’s the space occupied not only by that  per cent, who will ultimately decide on whether the UK remains together or breaks apart, but by the bulk of the -or-so per cent who are unwavering No voters.They do not share Tory DNA. They don’t accept devolution through gritted teeth – they embrace it because they want decisions to be made as closely to them as possible. They don’t instinctively look to Westminster for guidance, or for authority, or for leadership – they instinctively look to Holyrood. They may not think much of the Scottish Government or Scottish Parliament’s performance, but they still want Edinburgh, not London, to call most of the shots.They may not know exactly what devolved structure they want. But they know what they don’t want. They don’t want independence from the UK. But they also don’t want London to retain as much control as it does today.Reader,you are one of those people, you will soon be voting for the Labour Party.The Labour party’s recovery from the odious reign of Jeremy Corbyn may still have some way to run people will forgive, but they will take their time to forget. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether Sir Keir Starmer will be another Neil Kinnock, making the party acceptable again and preparing it for government, or another Tony Blair, taking it into government.However, on the future of the UK, Sir Keir and his Scottish counterpart, Anas Sarwar, have already made a giant leap forward. However ill-defined it may be, however much work they have to do to make the case for it, the ‘something in the middle’ option is highly likely to form the future of the UK settlement.Sir Keir and Mr Sarwar, not for the first time amongst Labour leaders, are placing themselves ahead of public opinion rather than reacting to it. They are leading, in contrast to the Tories, who for decades have been forced to follow, kicking and screaming.At some point, Labour will put flesh on the bones of its proposal for home rule .Having former Prime Minister Gordon Brown lead this report has some pitfalls, but nonetheless we can expect a vision of the UK looking more like countries such as Canada or Australia, with more financial devolution both to devolved parliaments and to local authorities, and in England to mayoralties, a reform of the House of Lords and perhaps also the Commons, and some sort of codication of the new arrangements.The publication of Labour’s plan, in itself, is far from enough. As long as indyref is in the future rather than the past, the debate will still tend towards the poles.Labour in Scotland would need a game-changer, probably in the form of Sir Keir becoming Prime Minister, which would force home rule onto the agenda, either because it was a manesto commitment which would then simply be enacted, or because it would be included in a three-option referendum .In the absence of that,the Tories remain in government at UK level, Labour and home rule will have to sit tight, frustrated for sure, but knowing their time will come.The Tories, of course, could read the market more astutely and move in this direction themselves. However, with past performance being the best indicator of future performance, we know the chance of that is vanishingly small. It’s all in the DNA.If we define Unionism as supporting the ideas which will bind the Union together, it is obvious which is the true party of the Union.It’s Labour, stupid.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"nc500-gairloch-glen-affric-among-projects-set-2-6m-funding-boost","story":"Now projects designed to reduce the impact of the sheer number of people on rural communities and create a more sustainable approach to enable tourism to thrive are to benefit from a share in a £. million cash injection.Eleven projects across the country will get a slice of the the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fundto improve facilities as part of Scotland’s drive for sustainable tourism.Round four of the funding sees successful funding applications for initiatives such as the Grandtully Visitor Management Project, which will receive £, to tackle visitor management pressures on the River Tay.

It is perhaps the only area in which the Global Britain boast actually holds true, and yet the right-wing of the Tory Party would destroy it to secure their dream of a Singapore on Thames.There is not much to be proud of in the UK as far as I am concerned, but the BBC is certainly one, and I can put up with any amount of celebrity-come-cake-cooking while singing and dancing on ice, as long as I can have David Attenborough, Professor Brian Cox and Jim Al-Khalili from time to time.John Jamieson, Ayr.* AS a supporter of self-government for Scotland, I regard the BBC with many reservations. The BBC has never allocated to Scotland its proper quota of funding, and it is obviously not neutral on the question of independence. Nevertheless I am in favour of a Scottish public service broadcaster, separated from government and regulated by proper standards of ethical journalism.I have some sympathy for the employees of Pacic Quay, who appear to have little or no autonomy. That the Tories dislike the BBC is obvious, and a “Fox News”-type clone would be more to their liking. The Labour Party also had a very close relationship with Rupert Murdoch, so the future of public service broadcasting,left to these two parties, looks bleak.GR Weir, Ochiltree.TORIES DESERVE BORIS JOHNSONI WAS struck by the letter from T J Dowdsstating that it is “unfair” to condemn so-called “decent Tories” who voted to make Boris Johnson Prime Minister. There is a famous saying which notes “fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me”.Those Tory supporters who backed the Conservatives at the last General Election were well aware of his character as being a liar and a philanderer, well before “partygate”. However, they were still more than happy to support him at the ballot box. Leopards don’t change their spots so, like Donald Trump, one wonders what these iniduals somehow expected to happen when he was in Downing Street Mr Johnson has been sacked from a newspaper for lying in an article he wrote and as a Conservative shadow minister for lying about an affair. This is only the tip of the iceberg, and his public and private le is littered with a litany of lies he has told, all very well documented. Yet, despite this, he was elected as leader of the Conservative Party and ultimately as Prime Minister with a not-inconsiderable majority.It is oft quoted that “the government you elect is the government you deserve”. Those complicit in elevating Mr Johnson to the role as Prime Minister of the UK, well aware of his character, may want to take some time to pause and reflect on whether this is truly the outcome they wanted. For those in Scotland the simple question I pose is: “is this really the best we can do ”Alex Orr, Edinburgh.PM NEEDS TO SHOW SHAMEWHEN it comes to the record of an inidual as slippery as Boris Johnson, I am afraid that “sorry” doesn’t mend it.Mr Johnson needs to demonstrate unequivocally that he is ashamed. Ashamed of telling lies to the British peopleashamed at evading the truth whenever this is uncomfortable for him and ashamed at the damage he has done to this country, not least over cynically entering into an international agreement on the Irish Protocol, and which he knew from the start was unworkable – simply to “get Brexit done”. A classic case, like everything , of contemptuously cutting the Gordian knot.Only by properly acknowledging guilt and by making amends,this is now even possible, can he be forgiven and escape being deservedly renowned as the worst prime minister in living, and possibly national, memory.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.TIME FOR A NEW LEADERI WAS not keen on Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister. I voted not to leave Europe. I am a lelong unionist and, in , voted for Scotland to remain in the Union. I have also continued, like many of us in Scotland, to stand up for Mr Johnson over the past couple of years as our elected leader, despite his obvious faults.Douglas Ross decided last week to call him out. He did so because it is patently obvious to most of us up here that having Mr Johnson in charge will make winning another referendum in the near future almost impossible, especially with people like Jacob Rees-Mogg making derisory comments about Mr Ross.I feel that Mr Ross made the wrong call in going public on his wish to see Mr Johnson go, but the response from Mr Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House, demonstrates extremely poor judgment at such a critical time for the Union. Although it will not affect how I vote in another referendum, there are tens of thousands of fellow Scots who have had enough of the shenanigans of Mr Johnson and his entourage and will veer towards voting to leave. The time is right now for a new leader.WM Allan, Stonehaven.BLAME SUNAK FOR COUNCIL WOESWHAT a nerve Miles Briggs and other Tories have on council funding , as it is Rishi Sunak’s UK Budget that is cutting the Scottish Government’s funding by . per cent compared to -, as confirmed by the Scottish Fiscal Commission, yet local authorities are receiving a cash increase of £ million although this is largely negated by escalating inflation caused by the UK Government’s failures on Brexit, soaring energy prices and its disastrous handling of Covid.Even with higher bills, Scottish council tax payers will remain much better off than in England or under Labour-run Wales. In Scotland the average Band D council tax bill is currently £ lower than in England and £ lower than Wales. Also, the average water bill is £ lower in Scotland and the income tax bill for median-waged employees is £ lower in Scotland under our more progressive system.Those who think that Mr Sunak will revive the fortunes of the Union are sadly deluded he broke the Tory promise on the triple lock for state pensions that will deprive our elderly citizens of £ in  while hiking National Insurance contributions for employers and employees, plus increasing our income tax bills through stealth by not increasing allowances in line with inflation.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.FRANCE SHOWS THE WAY ON ENERGYFRENCH President Emmaneul Macron just ordered EDF, the state energy company, to cap electricity prices to shield consumers. He can do this because the state owns  per cent of the shares in the company that supplies the majority of power to French consumers.Contrast that with the UK, where since the s the Government has sold off our energy resourcesto private companies. EDF is one of the foreign companies that bought a chunk and now owns more than % of UK electricity production. Another % is owned by German, Spanish and Dutch companies. Privatisation of our national assets has been a colossal failure for consumers and the environment, but a huge boon to private shareholders and company CEOs.As a result, UK consumers are looking at increases of % once the price cap is lted in April. Ofgem, the energy regulator, must by law pass on rising costs to consumers.This will be especially painful for Scottish consumers. We already pay the highest transmission charges in the UK while England and Wales get a subsidy. Plus, Scottish gas production is % of total UK production. And we’re just eight per cent of the population. What would this gas be worthScotland had control over its own energy resources  At least £. billion, the sales value of Scottish oil and gas production in .And London tells us we’re too wee and poor to go it alone.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.Read more: Lets lance the Indy boil with a fully informed vote"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-djokovic-not-hard-done-blame-kicked-australia","story":"It seems very clear that Djokovic had already committed two signicant and serious offences: first, he appeared in public and mixed freely with many people, including children, in the days following his positive Covid test.

Of all head of state options available, including some kind of political presidency, I thought a constitutional monarchy the best choice available. Then, when I took early retirement from working offshore some years ago and became involved in dealing with overseas tourists, I began to see the huge economic benefits.Most of the many foreign tourists with whom I spoke were fascinated by the royal family and in fact knew more about them and their way of le and where they lived than I did and visits to royal sites were top of the agenda. It was a kind of Hollywood stardom. It opened my eyes to their value to this country. Perhaps the institution itself is outdated, but there are many pluses.I find it most sad, therefore, to see Prince Andrew and his nephew, Prince Harry, bringing the whole institution into disrepute. It is time I believe for both to disappear from public le permanently before any more damage is done.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.BIBLE LESSON FOR THE DUKEIAN Thomsonwonders what The Queen makes of the Duke of Yorks behaviour and its consequences.I well remember, at school, during a particularly rumbustious period our teacher calling us to order and told us to read Proverbs chapter  verse , when we got home.It is a pity that Andrew, spoilt child of The Queen, was never apparently made aware of the passage concerned: \"A wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.\"Perhaps he wouldnt have cared anyway.David Hay, Minard.KIRK SHOULD LET GO OF PRIVILEGEIN response to plummeting congregation numbers and growing financial debt, the Church of Scotland is considering mergers, staff cuts and the handing over of St Giles’ Cathedral to Historic Environment Scotland, the state-funded heritage .There is no schadenfreude for the Edinburgh Secular Society in this development: these historical buildings are important to all Scots, including the small group who use them for religious worship.However, with even religious architecture coming into state ownership we must surely now let go of any vestigial notion that the Kirk speaks for all with its privileged position in education, law and government.Neil Barber, Edinburgh Secular Society.VOTE AGAINST THE PARKING LEVYTHE Scottish Government is ramping up its war on motorists. Councils will be given the power to introduce a workplace parking levy from March , . Nottingham is the only city in the UK imposing this levy and charges an annual £ per space. Many businesses have passed this cost on to the employees who use the spaces.Scottish Transport Minister Graeme Dey, who is behind this draconian decision, has said: \"Scotland needs to take world-leading bold action to tackle the climate emergency.\" This is laughable since Scotland is responsible for only . per cent of global emissions. Scotland has . million cars but there are . billion in the world. Other than car-hating Edinburgh I suspect few councils will implement this policy especially as Scottish local elections are due to take place on May .Motorists must vote out the SNP and Greens before it is too late.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM COVIDEARLIER todayI did one of my regular seven-mile walks at Chatelherault country park. I usually see between  and  others on that walk. Today I met around  people enjoying the beautul weather, with pram-pushing families, groups of ,  and more, including teens, cyclists, many dog walkers, people on horses and even a donkey. As a nation clearly Covid has persuaded thousands of us that walking in the fresh air and the woods is good for our physical and of course our mental health.Long may that trend last with our obese and stressed-out friends. Covid does have at least one positive public health bonus.Max Cruickshank, Glasgow.MUST OUR LEADERS BE SQUIRTS IVE tried to escape the news by reading about the sea squirts I once saw in the water off Kyle of Lochalsh. This marine invertebrate is born with a rudimentary brain and wanders about the sea until it finds a rock it likes. At that point, it takes root, digests its own brain, and settles down for le. The squirts progress is often cited as an metaphor for academic le, but something is far wrong when politicians and other public servants take it as their lodestar.Gilbert MacKay, Newton Mearns."},{"url":null,"title":"omicron-restrictions-end-monday-amid-optimism-scotland-exiting-virus-wave","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said there was \"renewed optimism\" with Covid cases and hospital admissions now in decline, as she confirmed that the Scottish Government will not expand the need for vaccine passports to hospitality businesses.From Monday, all restrictions implemented in response to the Omicron surge will end, meaning table service will no longer be mandatory in pubs and restaurants canto full capacity without physical distancing.Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues can reopen from January  with requirements for Covid passes still in place, while attendance at indoor events - currently capped at between  and  - canto normal.Guidance advising Scots to limit socialising to a maximum of three households at a time will also come to an end from Monday, although the public is advised to be cautious and avoid unnecessary social interactions until the end of January.Working from home, where possible, should also continue although Ms Sturgeon said she anticipated moving to a \"more hybrid model\" from February.The First Minister said the latest data on infections and hospitalisations \"gives us confidence that we have turned the corner on the Omicron wave\". Ms Sturgeon said it would \"not be proportionate\" to introduce Covid certication requiring customers entering bars and restaurants to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test \"given that cases are now falling quite rapidly\". However, she did not rule out adopting the measure in future, adding: \"If cases were to start to rise very sharply again, extension of certication may well be a more proportionate alternative to other, more restrictive measures.\"The changes in place from Monday put Scotland back to the Beyond Zero phase of restrictions first introduced in August. The Scottish Tories have called for vaccine passports and facemasks in schools to be scrapped by February, with a phasedto workplaces and a gradual end to self-isolation rules from then on. Scottish Conservative Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said Ms Sturgeon should accept that that the vaccine passport scheme “is a dud and scrap it altogether\". He added: “The First Ministers statement did begin a sea change in the government’s policy, starting to sht from a rules-based approach more towards trusting the Scottish public, as we were pushing for.\"Downing Street is also reportedly considering plans to replace mandatory self-isolation for infected iniduals - enforceable through fines - with guidance to stay-at-home instead from March, with requirements for travellers arriving in the UK from abroad to take a Covid test reportedly set to be axed.

This is also likley to be reviewed. \"The situation we face today is much less severe than it might have been without the sacrices everyone has made over these past few weeks,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\"Despite what you might be hearing, though, we have not yet moved from the epidemic to the endemic phase of COVID, although I hope that transition is underway.\"However, we are - I hope - once again entering a calmer phase of the epidemic.\"\"That then allows us to consider the adaptations we might need to make to build our resilience and manage the virus in a less restrictive way in future as we do move into an endemic phase.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com     \u003cpicture","title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The cost of the bid was £million.Simon Hodge, chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said: #Today’s results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland’s ability to transform our energy sector. Just a couple of months after hosting COP, we’ve now taken a major step towards powering our future economy with renewable electricity.“In addition to the environmental benefits, this also represents a major investment in the Scottish economy, with around £m being delivered straight into the public finances and billions of pounds worth of supply chain commitments.#The iety and scale of the projects that will progress onto the next stages shows both the remarkable progress of the offshore wind sector, and a clear sign that Scotland is set to be a major hub for the further development of this technology in the years to come.#More on this story in this week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But this is entirely in the gt of employers who simply need to revoke their devastating pension cuts and take long-overdue action over deteriorating pay and working conditions.”The UCU claims that cuts to the Universities Superannuation Schemepensions scheme would reduce the guaranteed retirement income of a typical member by %.It has also suggested that pay for university staff has fallen by around a fth after  years of below inflation pay offers, while thousands of academic staff are employed on “insecure” contracts.The union is demanding that cuts to the pensions scheme are revoked and members are offered a £, pay increase, as well as action to tackle “unmanageable workloads” and “insecure contracts”.But the UCEA, which represents employers in the pay dispute, says there will be “dismay” at universities where strike action will now be considered.UCEA chief executive Raj Jethwa said: “There was surprise and disappointment at UCU’s decision to re-ballot hand-picked HE institutions over last year’s pay outcome. Just over a quarterof the branches reached the legal % turnout threshold required for industrial action over pay.“While the results will be disappointing for UCU’s campaign leaders, there will be further widespread dismay at all at those HE institutions where strike action will now be considered.“It is now nearly six monthssince employees covered by the national pay negotiations saw pay increases of at least .%. The great majority of HE staff understand the financial realities for their institutions and have moved on from last year’s balanced outcome.“We trust that the UCU will now engage constructively in this year’smulti-employer negotiating round which is planned to begin at the end of March.”Universities UK , which represents employers in the pensions dispute, said: “Students will be dismayed that the union is considering more strike action yet still not proposing any solution to this dispute.“We will be considering the responses to the recent scheme member consultation fully with employers, UCU and USS in the coming weeks.“The USS Trustee has stated, however, that any further changes need to be agreed quickly – by the end of February – to avoid the start of the punishing and unaffordable cost escalator in April which would see the already high member and employer contribution rates almost double over the next three years.“No employer has indicated any willingness to pay such exorbitant costs – and we know thatthese higher rates go ahead they would have devastating consequences for many employers and price more members out of the scheme.“We remain prepared to consult employers on any reasonable, affordable and implementable proposal from UCU, including on the level of covenant support they could afford to offer it.“Meanwhile, we continue to progress work on possible alternative scheme design, a lower-cost option and shaping an independent review of scheme governance.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She loves her mum Kathleen, her father Ray, her big sister Amy and big brother Cathal and all of her family and friends so much.“She was always there, always willing to help anybody, anywhere, at any time, and always put herself last.“She had so many talents which combined made her an incredibly loving and beautul person. We were all so lucky to know and love and spend as much time with her as possible.“She is the greatest love of my le. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire le.

A walk on a mild and sunny afternoon in January should be a happy event, promising the brighter and warmer days of spring and summer.“We all know that no inidual should die like Ashling and no family should suffer like Ashling’s.“Respect is an old-fashioned word but it is an important one. Respect was missing last Wednesday but it has re-emerged here all the stronger.“Let us respect each other.”He added that a light during last week’s darkness was the outpouring of support and sympathy.Parish priest Michael Meade told mourners that Ashling’s family has been “robbed of your most precious gt”.“A gt that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many, many beyond yourselves and bounds of your own home,” Fr Meade added.“Let us not be afraid to make change a reality in all our lives, change for what only is good.“Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt – this is the heavy price we pay for love – we gather as a family of faith, to be with, to support by our prayer and our presence, those whose darkness is deep, whose pain is raw and fierce.“The issues raised in many ways and by many voices since this horrible act of violence invaded all our lives will, we pray, continue to evolve and bring the change we need so much.“Not to talk about it but to simply give and show respect.”He said that Ms Murphy’s love was “freely given and shared” through music, sport and her vocation as a teacher. vw,vw,px, px\"Family members place their hands on the coffin as it is carried out of St Brigid’s Church, Mountbolus, Co Offaly “Today we share our love, our grief, our faith and our comfort with the Murphy and Leonard families.”Children outside the church held photographs of Ms Murphy and roses.

A number of children also held fiddles and tin whistles.A family friend also spoke on behalf of Ms Murphy’s family following the funeral.“Ashling was born into a tight-knit family, where love was freely given and in turn Ashling learned to express freely that love,” he told mourners.“Her parents, Ray and Kathleen, watched with pride their youngest grow into the beautul, confident and vibrant young woman who lived and loved le to the full.“As often happens in rural communities, her tutors and mentors she had as a child became her colleagues at Durrow National School where she began teaching first class.“Teaching came naturally to Ashling as she had been teaching both tin whistle and fiddle.“Her family home was filled with traditional music every weekend as children learned to love what Ashling loved.“Ashling, at  years, was within her large family the baby to her older cousins, but yet a role model to her younger cousins.“She loved socialising. She never confined herself to any particular norm, but was a friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing her.“Her partner of five years Ryan was the love of her le and they had a clear vision of their future.“She was everything you could hope for in a young woman and she will never be out of our hearts.“We will cherish her memory and keep alive her legacy and achievements in her short le.”Vigils have been held across Ireland and the world to remember Ms Murphy and to call for a change in tackling gender-based violence.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The club made a statement to show our disappointment.Club statement.— Tottenham HotspurJanuary , “I think thatthe Premier League decides to postpone games for injury it means that maybe they have to try to make a best schedule and to reduce many to play games, andthey don’t want injuries andthey don’t want the risk to postpone for injuries.“Sometimes it’s very strange to listen about the welfare of the players, becauseyou think that someone has to look to the welfare of the players, surely you have to play less games and especially not to play games within two days.“Otherwise why do you speak about the welfare of players  It’s only honest views, only to tell something that is stupid in my opinion because you protect the players to give them rest, to play and rest butwe want only to play and then sure you can speak about the welfare of the players. It’s very strange.“My feeling is that when there is a situation to play we have to play. Not to postpone games for injuries, for international duty.“I think we have a big problem to solve and it’s Covid, but only about this situation can you decide to postpone, not for other situations.“Honestly, it’s my first time in my le – and I’ve had a bit of experience in football – to see postpone games because of injuries.”Spurs are back in action when they visit Leicester on Wednesday for a rearranged game that was originally postponed in December.The north London club wanted the game called off so they could play their outstanding UEFA Conference League group game against Rennes, which had been postponed the previous week due to a coronavirus outbreak in the Spurs squad.The Premier League declined the request – resulting in Conte’s side effectively being disqualied from the competition – only to postpone the game anyway due to a shortage of players in the Leicester camp.Tomorrow: Leicesterpic tOHhiSZxk— Tottenham HotspurJanuary , Spurs are still deciding whether to appeal against UEFA’s decision to award the game to Rennes, but Conte blames the situation on the Premier League.Conte said: “Until now there is a decision that theydropped us. I repeat it was because the Premier League didn’t want to move the game against Leicester, this is the only reason.“Leicester then asked to move the game and they did. I think it was a big damage to Tottenham from the Premier League. You have to try to protect your team in Europe.“Instead they penalised us in a bad way. We are working, we have passion for football and we like to do this but they need to show us respect for our job.”The PA news agency contacted the Premier League for a response and were pointed towards the written criteria for postponing games.With the January transfer window halfway through Conte is keen for additions to his squad, evenit is not the ideal signing. vw,vw,px, px\"Antonio Conte is still looking for January additions to his Spurs squad “I know that the transfer window in January is always very dficult and it is more simple when you start the season to buy important players,” he added.“In January it is not easy, but at the same time we know very well thatthere is the opportunity and alsoit’s not the best opportunity, but we need to do something.“AlsoI repeat that this could not be the best opportunity but I think that we are in a situation where we have to try to implement the squad because the squad is not so big.”Son Heung-min, Eric Dier and Cristian Romero are all expected to be out for the game at the King Power Stadium.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.“This is the future we want for our children. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.“We need to have big aspirations to build a better Northern Ireland. We must end segregation in our society.”But the CCMS said the choice of language urging the “need to end educational apartheid,” had been “extremely concerning”.“Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape,” said Mr Campbell.“CCMS categorically rejects the very idea that Catholic schools are isive or that they stand in opposition to an inclusive and erse education system. Catholic Schools promote the dignity and worth of every human person the purpose and value of education the relationship between education, family, and the local community and the purpose and meaning of le itself.“The terminology used by Mr Beattie is not helpful and is representative of the misconception that schools that do not have an integrated status are not welcoming and inclusive, particularly given the longstanding work that has gone on in not only Catholic schools but rather all schools to promote shared education.The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated v integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘Integrated’. There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.”Mr Campbell has now offered to meet with the UUP leader“I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities,” he added.“Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.“Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind. Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender. Catholic Schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.“The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – Maintained, Controlled, Integrated, Irish medium and Grammar. However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.”Related topicsDoug BeattieMore On Doug Beattie PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionThere’s no longer any justication for segregating pupilsVigil held on steps of Stormont for murder victim Ashling Murphy PremiumDon’t tamper with the law on double-jobbing, warns RitchieThe Weekly Political Spin: From work events and Jurassic Park, to ‘educational apartheid’ and George UselessUUP leader slams Jim Allister after Covid query asking what precautions in place to prevent ROI citizens availing of free testing kits from NIMost ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days First Minister Paul Givan has not joined Presbyterian Church, according to DUPJoe McCarron: Man released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccine campaigners to be buried todayRocker on acid trip thought Orange band was giant slugIrish hauliers and Dublin Port officials report more goods arriving via Northern Ireland ports under NI ProtocolTop VideosPlayLarge crowds gather for Ashling Murphy funeralPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaLatest EducationMalachi O’DohertyOpinionThere’s no longer any justication for segregating pupilsFewer pupils absent at start of new school term in NI than before ChristmasViewpointOpinionWe should invest in future, not harm itEllen FearonOpinionEconomic cuts targeted at students would be a betrayal of a generationEducation cuts plans branded ‘an attack on a generation’LatestAntonio Conte: Premier League’s handling of postponed fixtures is strangeBrentford boss Thomas Frank plays down talk of Christian Eriksen moveAntoine Dupont named in -man France squad for Six Nations campaignGareth Southgate seeking legal advice after  claims in cryptocurrency scamPartner of Ashling Murphy describes her as a ‘shining light’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When handing down the sentence Mr Justice Tony Hunt at the SCC described Harte as the ringleader and the person who had inflicted most of the injuries on Mr Lunney.Two other men involved in the businessman#s kidnapping and assault, Alan O#Brien , of Shelmalier Road, and Darren Redmond , from Caledon Road, both East Wall, Dublin, were also given y prison sentences by the SCC.The anonymity order, which had initially been granted by the SCC, had been extended by the High Court in December.The order had been put in place when Harte, with an address at Island Quay Apartments, East Wall, was first before the courts in connection with the offences.It was granted because he had been due to go on trial before the Central Criminal Court in relation to an unrelated charge of murder.That trial collapsed and the charge against Harte was dismissed, after the DPP entered a nolle prosequi in the case.However, the order was continued, on a temporary basis after his conviction by SCC.This was done to protect the man#s rights to a fair trial as he has other unrelated criminal matters pending before the criminal courts.Following his conviction, Harte#s lawyers claimed that his naming by the media in reports could prejudice his rights to a fair trial before a judge and jury.Arising out of those concerns Harte launched High Court judicial review proceedings against the DPP and the SCC seeking orders including a temporary order extending his anonymity.The anonymity order was continued until Tuesday#s sitting of the High Court.On Tuesday Harte#s lawyers had asked the court to continue the order, arguing that there was a possibility that some of the criminal matters may be heard within the six month period.He sought an extension until February when one of the cases against him was due to be mentioned before the courts.Michael Hourigan BL for Harte said that there was a prospect that some of the criminal matters could be heard within the next six months.It was argued that a fade factor of about six months, between the time a person is sentenced to when they go before a judge and jury in other courts, was required.The application to further continue the order was opposed by the DPP, represented by Sean Guerin SC.Counsel said that there was little or no chance of the pending matters being heard within the next six months.There was therefore no reason why the man should not now be named counsel said.What was a spurious unfounded and articial arrangement should now be removed, he said.Counsel said that the continuation of the order was being sought as part of an attempt by Harte to continue to prevent his name from being published for quite some time.In his ruling, Mr Justice Meenan said that it was part of the criminal process that those convicted of offences be named, bar in certain exceptional circumstances.Harte#s case did not come under one of those exceptions, and the judge said that there was no reason to continue the order.He said that Harte could make any application he needs to the courts to have safeguards put in place to prevent him suffering any prejudice in any forthcoming trial.Related topicsKevin LunneyMore On Kevin Lunney PremiumLunney firm fears TV show about Sean Quinn could escalate campaign against them PremiumNet closing on the paymasters behind Kevin Lunney kidnap terrorKevin Lunney’s torturers get  years jail time PremiumKevin Lunney: ‘I don’t know why they did it...

fundamental importance.“My own personal circumstances are secondary to that.“I would never want to say anything in a public way that would diminish that Gospel witness.”Mr Givan has stood by his decision to attend the centenary event.“When the invitation came in it was obviously something I considered, and I took the view that it was appropriate for me, as First Minister, to attend,” he said.Mr Givan’s resignation means that there are now fewer than  DUP MLAs who call themselves Free Presbyterians.Although the church and Northern Ireland’s biggest political party were never officially linked, most of the early DUP members were from a Free Presbyterian backgroundIn recent years, however, the two bodies have grown apart.The first major schism came when Mr Paisley opted to become Northern Ireland First Minister and enter a devolved government with Sinn Fein.The church handed Rev Paisley an ultimatum of either renouncing his position as First Minister or quitting his role as moderator, which he had held for  years.Rev Paisley chose politics and served as First Minister alongside the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein as Deputy First Minister.The Free Presbyterian Church was also highly critical of the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as an Antrim and Newtownabbey council candidate, in .In a statement about Ms Bennington, the church said that it “underlines its opposition to all martial and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church, we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of scripture.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days

It was designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and came into force on January , .Commenting on the rise in freight traffic from GB into Northern Ireland, Mr Leheny explained the tougher controls at Dublin Port has contributed to the sht.And Jarlath O#Keefe, from Grant Thornton Ireland, said: The CSO figures for November confirmed that there has been a signicant increase in cross border trade on the island of Ireland in  following Brexit. This is due in part to businesses adjusting their supply chains to avoid the administrative burden associated with importing goods from Britain.”The Department for Agriculture , which is responsible for implementing the protocol, revealed a total of , checks were carried out on , consignments at Northern Ireland’s ports between January , and December , .On average, a total of , trailers or vehicles from GB pass through Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint ports each year.Sanitary and Phytosanitaryconsignments subject to checks includes live animals, products of animal origin, plant and plant products, and high risk food not of animal origin.The three types of checks required are documentary, identity and physical. Straightforward documentaryand identitychecks made up , of the total checks in . Only , physical checks had to be carried out on lorries.Mr Leheny explained physical checks, which can last for several hours, are a “last resort”the documentary or identity paperwork is not up to scratch.He added that the number of consignment checks would have created a lot more admin work for DAERA officials, hauliers and traders.“A physical inspection is a last resort so it’s natural that would be as low as it is becausethe documentation doesn#t give DAERA the information they need well then they have to open up the doors,” said Mr Leheny.“They would say it’s potentially an unknown load so we have to physically open up the trailer and see what’s in it.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson felt the figures should act as a “sobering statistic” for those who think the protocol is necessary. Behind those figures is a story of additional costs, delays, disrupted supply chains and products which had to be disposed of because checks meant goods got ruined,” he said.DUP MLA Diane Dodds added that % of all EU checks take place between GB and Northern Ireland and the figures highlight “the scale of the Irish Sea border imposed by the protocol”.“It is % more expensive to transport goods into Northern Ireland now because of the protocol#s paperwork costs,” she continued. “The Government has a responsibility to take action and we need to see a timetable for progress quickly set out.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “best way” to reduce checks at ports is for the UK Government to agree to an EU proposal for a Swiss-style veterinary agreement, which would remove almost all physical SPS checks.“We have been making this proposal for months because we know that it will reduce checks and controls by %,” said the Foyle MP.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the SPS checks are a product of Brexit, and “in particular the decision” of the UK Government to opt for a hard Brexit.“An SPS agreement is necessary to reduce the current checks and those that would be otherwise requiredthe grace period ends without a permanent solution,” he stated.A spokesperson for DAERA said under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland is required to apply SPS checks on eligible goods entering the EU zone from GB, in line with those checks prescribed for Third Countries.

Credit: Matt Mackey PresseyeGarrett HarganTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailRoyal County Down has been voted the best golf course in the world, with one local golfer saying the “spectacular views” are part of what makes it unique.Professional golfer and European Tour winner, Simon Thornton is based in Newcastle, Co Down, and while he acknowledged that it can come down to personal preference, he said there is something “special” about the naturally beautul links setting.On the front nine, the towering Mountains of Mourne provide a brooding backdrop.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Thornton explained: “You don’t get to be number one golf course in the world without having something special.“The front nine is probably as fine a nine holes as you’ll see anywhere in the world. Whenever you’re coming up the ninth tee and get to the top of the fairway, you see the mountains, hotel and clubhouse, the views are just incredible.“You get a lot of great golf courses but they just don’t have the spectacular views which Newcastle does, with the mountains in the background.”Mr Thornton has played all over the world and said there is no course quite like it and it is one of the most dficult to play.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Announcing the winner, Today’s Golfer said it is not Photoshop wizardry, Royal County Down really is aesthetically perfect. The second reason for awarding it the top spot was because it is a relentlessly probing challenge of all aspects of the game.The publication said: “It is indubitably an awesome test, one which in inclement weather could verge toward being too dficult for high handicappers. That is the sum total of any criticism you could level at the course we believe is the finest in the world. Royal County Down is, by any stretch of the imagination, not especially forgiving. Carries of up to  yards are sometimes required and while the fairways are often wide, gorse and rough mean waywardness is punished.“Drive bunkers add to the premium on direction, and their pleasingly unkempt nature — with overhanging lips of marram, fescue and heather – adds additional penalty.“Domed greens dismiss approach shots lacking accuracy and recovery shots around them are perilous, for the slick slopes take mishit chipsaway from the pin and indeed potentially off the green entirely.”It added: “Mistakes are punished here... and are compoundednot accepted. Fortune doesn’t often favour the brave at RCD.

PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland needs to follow the example of devolved governments in Scotland and Wales and lt remaining Covid restrictions, the head of a leading business representative organisation has said.Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said predictions about how hard Omicron would hit had been “wide of the mark”, but added the effect of restrictions on businesses was “very real”.It was announced on Tuesday that Scotland’s Covid- restrictions are to be eased, with nightclubs reopening, large indoor events resuming and social distancing rules dropped from January .Last week, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford announced restrictions to people’s daily lives were to be eased as Omicron cases were falling “rapidly”.Northern Ireland still has a series of restrictions on the hospitality sector which were introduced last month, including the closure of nightclubs.Ministers must move fast to remove those restrictions and amend their work from home guidance to help businesses to recover.Simon HamiltonMr Hamilton said: “With Scotland being the latest devolved administration to indicate that they are ending most of the restrictions they introduced before Christmas due to concerns over the spread of the Omicron iant, it is time for the Northern Ireland Executive to follow the example of Scotland and Wales and spell out when restrictions here will similarly end. “Thankfully, the predictions of experts and some politicians about how hard Omicron would hit us were wide of the mark.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive

throughout the pandemic will conclude that it has been grossly ineffective and has caused unnecessary confusion.“Delay, indecision and petty politicking has prevented the Sinn Fein DUP First Ministers

available public health data.“People need to know what will happen and when we anticipate it will happen.“It must also include targeted support for those sectors which remain vulnerable to transmission.“The success of the vaccination programme and the effort made by people to keep each other safe has put us in a good position to begin planning for the recovery phase of the pandemic.“It cannot be dominated by the chaos of the early response.”Last week, First Minister Paul Givan expressed hope that the Stormont Executive will be able to announce coronavirus rule relaxations at its

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

So two for Northern Ireland would do the job.Note NI already uses nuclear generated electricity. Electricity is pumped undersea from Scotland to Moyle, Co Antrim by the Moyle Interconnector. So some of this electricity will be Scottish nuclear power generated on Scottish soil. A fact those in NI who oppose nuclear energy plants on NI soil must put in their pipe and smoke.And Northern Ireland holiday home owners in Donegal will be using French nuclear energy. The new undersea Celtic Connector links France to the Cork coast. France generates % of its power from nuclear.RR’s world class nuclear energy scientists are confident of strong demand worldwide for their mighty mini nuclear energy stations. Even Republic of Irelandmight buy one by repealing prohibition of nuclear energy generation on Irish soil.Importing nuclear energy from French soil — enough to power half a million homes — to  counties soil has undermined this prohibition position. The EU move just before Christmas to rebrand nuclear energy green is a further blow to continuing RoI prohibition.It seems therefore, North and South, a coach and four is driving through the no nuclear energy stations on our soil argument.So in the May elections I will be asking Foyle constituency candidates what’s their vision, for Derry and Belfast, becoming part of the fast emerging new mighty mini nuclear energy age.My vision ismini nuclear stations generate cheaper electricity up ahead it means no six o’clock folk — those who can only afford energy at tea time in the middle of winter — then we must build them.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

Billy Hutchinson is the only remaining PUP representative in Belfast council.John Kyle has been a Belfast councillor since  when he was co-opted following the death of former party leader David Ervine.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She loves her mum Kathleen, her father Ray, her big sister Amy and big brother Cathal and all of her family and friends so much.“She was always there, always willing to help anybody, anywhere, at any time, and always put herself last.“She had so many talents which combined made her an incredibly loving and beautul person. We were all so lucky to know and love and spend as much time with her as possible.“She is the greatest love of my le. I will cherish the last five years we spent together for my entire le. I hope that some day, God willing, we can be reunited once more and continue the great plans we had made for each other. vw,vw,px, px\"Traditional Irish musicians play outside St Brigid’s Church, Mountbolus, Co Offaly, at Ashling Murphy’s funeral “Goodbye for now, but not forever, darling.

A walk on a mild and sunny afternoon in January should be a happy event, promising the brighter and warmer days of spring and summer.“We all know that no inidual should die like Ashling and no family should suffer like Ashling’s.“Respect is an old-fashioned word but it is an important one. Respect was missing last Wednesday but it has re-emerged here all the stronger.“Let us respect each other.”He added that a light during last week’s darkness was the outpouring of support and sympathy.Parish priest Michael Meade told mourners that Ashling’s family has been “robbed of your most precious gt”.“A gt that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many, many beyond yourselves and bounds of your own home,” Fr Meade added.“Let us not be afraid to make change a reality in all our lives, change for what only is good.“Together we grieve, we pray, we hurt – this is the heavy price we pay for love – we gather as a family of faith, to be with, to support by our prayer and our presence, those whose darkness is deep, whose pain is raw and fierce.“The issues raised in many ways and by many voices since this horrible act of violence invaded all our lives will, we pray, continue to evolve and bring the change we need so much.“Not to talk about it but to simply give and show respect.”He said that Ms Murphy’s love was “freely given and shared” through music, sport and her vocation as a teacher. vw,vw,px, px\"Family members place their hands on the coffin as it is carried out of St Brigid’s Church, Mountbolus, Co Offaly “Today we share our love, our grief, our faith and our comfort with the Murphy and Leonard families.”Children outside the church held photographs of Ms Murphy and roses. The message next to Ms Murphy’s image read: “Fly high in the sky, Our shining light.”Representatives from Ms Murphy’s local Gaelic football club as well as from her old school attended the parish church of St Brigid.Schoolchildren provided a guard of honour outside the church prior to the funeral. A number of children also held fiddles and tin whistles.A family friend also spoke on behalf of Ms Murphy’s family following the funeral.“Ashling was born into a tight-knit family, where love was freely given and in turn Ashling learned to express freely that love,” he told mourners.“Her parents, Ray and Kathleen, watched with pride their youngest grow into the beautul, confident and vibrant young woman who lived and loved le to the full.“As often happens in rural communities, her tutors and mentors she had as a child became her colleagues at Durrow National School where she began teaching first class.“Teaching came naturally to Ashling as she had been teaching both tin whistle and fiddle.“Her family home was filled with traditional music every weekend as children learned to love what Ashling loved.“Ashling, at  years, was within her large family the baby to her older cousins, but yet a role model to her younger cousins.“She loved socialising. She never confined herself to any particular norm, but was a friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing her.“Her partner of five years Ryan was the love of her le and they had a clear vision of their future.“She was everything you could hope for in a young woman and she will never be out of our hearts.“We will cherish her memory and keep alive her legacy and achievements in her short le.”Vigils have been held across Ireland and the world to remember Ms Murphy and to call for a change in tackling gender-based violence..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Partner of Ashling Murphy describes her as a  ushining light u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The club made a statement to show our disappointment.Club statement.— Tottenham HotspurJanuary , “I think thatthe Premier League decides to postpone games for injury it means that maybe they have to try to make a best schedule and to reduce many to play games, andthey don’t want injuries andthey don’t want the risk to postpone for injuries.“Sometimes it’s very strange to listen about the welfare of the players, becauseyou think that someone has to look to the welfare of the players, surely you have to play less games and especially not to play games within two days.“Otherwise why do you speak about the welfare of players  It’s only honest views, only to tell something that is stupid in my opinion because you protect the players to give them rest, to play and rest butwe want only to play and then sure you can speak about the welfare of the players. It’s very strange.“My feeling is that when there is a situation to play we have to play. Not to postpone games for injuries, for international duty.“I think we have a big problem to solve and it’s Covid, but only about this situation can you decide to postpone, not for other situations.“Honestly, it’s my first time in my le – and I’ve had a bit of experience in football – to see postpone games because of injuries.”.removeSpurs are back in action when they visit Leicester on Wednesday for a rearranged game that was originally postponed in December.The north London club wanted the game called off so they could play their outstanding UEFA Conference League group game against Rennes, which had been postponed the previous week due to a coronavirus outbreak in the Spurs squad.The Premier League declined the request – resulting in Conte’s side effectively being disqualied from the competition – only to postpone the game anyway due to a shortage of players in the Leicester camp.Tomorrow: Leicesterpic tOHhiSZxk— Tottenham HotspurJanuary , Spurs are still deciding whether to appeal against UEFA’s decision to award the game to Rennes, but Conte blames the situation on the Premier League.Conte said: “Until now there is a decision that theydropped us. I repeat it was because the Premier League didn’t want to move the game against Leicester, this is the only reason.“Leicester then asked to move the game and they did. I think it was a big damage to Tottenham from the Premier League. You have to try to protect your team in Europe.“Instead they penalised us in a bad way. We are working, we have passion for football and we like to do this but they need to show us respect for our job.”The PA news agency contacted the Premier League for a response and were pointed towards the written criteria for postponing games.With the January transfer window halfway through Conte is keen for additions to his squad, evenit is not the ideal signing. vw,vw,px, px\"Antonio Conte is still looking for January additions to his Spurs squad “I know that the transfer window in January is always very dficult and it is more simple when you start the season to buy important players,” he added.“In January it is not easy, but at the same time we know very well thatthere is the opportunity and alsoit’s not the best opportunity, but we need to do something.“AlsoI repeat that this could not be the best opportunity but I think that we are in a situation where we have to try to implement the squad because the squad is not so big.”Son Heung-min, Eric Dier and Cristian Romero are all expected to be out for the game at the King Power Stadium..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Antonio Conte: Premier League us handling of postponed fixtures is strange article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
